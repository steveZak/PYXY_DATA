        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany. As of 2016, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018). The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007. Basel is the most densely populated city in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBasel has an area, as of 2009, of 23.91 square kilometers (9.23 sq mi). Of this area, 0.95 km2 (0.37 sq mi) or 4.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.88 km2 (0.34 sq mi) or 3.7% is forested.

Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.7% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 8.9%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 2.5% is used for growing crops and 1.3% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen system, Basel features a continental-influenced oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), due to its relatively far inland position. The city averages 120.4 days of rain or snow annually and on average receives 842 mm (33.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Basel receives an average of 99 mm (3.9 in) of rain. The month with the most days of precipitation is also May, with an average of 12.4 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 45 mm (1.8 in) of precipitation over 8.4 days.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThe city of Basel functions as the capital of the Swiss half-canton of Basel-Stadt, though several of its suburbs are located in the half-canton of Basel-Landschaft or the canton of Aargau. Others are even located in France and Germany.\n\n\n=== Canton ===\nThe canton Basel-Stadt consists of three municipalities: Riehen, Bettingen, and the city Basel itself. The political structure and agencies of the city and the canton are identical.\n\n\n=== City ===\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nThe city itself has 19 quarters:\n\nGrossbasel (Greater Basel):\nKleinbasel (Lesser Basel):\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is In Silber ein schwarzer Baselstab.

They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority. The president (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election, while the heads of the other departments are appointed by the collegiate. The current president is Dr Guy Morin. The executive body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (German: Rathaus) on the central Marktplatz.

Unlike the members of the Executive Council, the members of the Grand Council are not politicians by profession, but they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020. The legislative body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (Rathaus).\nThe last election was held on 23 October 2016 for the mandate period (Legislatur) of 2017\u20132021.

The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%.

Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel.

Live marketing company and fair organizer MCH Group has its head office in Basel.\n\nThe carnival of the city of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (Morgestraich) on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\nBasel Tattoo, founded in 2006 by the local Top Secret Drum Corps, has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the Edinburgh Military Tattoo.

These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The football club FC Basel continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the 2008 European Championships, as well as Geneva, Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The championships were jointly hosted by Switzerland and Austria. BSC Old Boys and Concordia Basel are the other football teams in Basel.\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is ice hockey.

          "If you\u2019re staying in Basel I would really recommend visiting the Munster. Not only the inside is beautiful but the view from the top is gorgeous.",
          "Anyone visiting Basel should stop by to get the real feel for the city. Basel has much to offer to what meets the eye, here is a good starting point to get a feel for the city.",
          "If you like to climb a tons of stair this is the activity for you. Climb all the way up of the 2 towers for an amazing view of the city. Suggested in spring-summer, kind of slippery (but not dangerous) and cold in winter-autumn Ok for kids but I would suggest them to be",
          "Well worth a visit but be aware that climbing the towers is not for the large of girth or unsteady on the feet. Some parts are pitch black which makes finding your footing tricky. Definitely worth the climb though, especially if you are a fan of gargoyles.",
          "Peaceful beautiful church, inside and out, loved that I had somewhere where I could light a candle and have a moment in memory of my mother.",
          "The Munster is up at the top of the hill overlooking the river and situated in a nice square, surrounded by interesting buildings. The red sandstone is amazing and looks as though it was only built a short while ago. The roof is covered in colourful tiles. By contrast, the",
          "The church is beautiful and the view from the top of the towers is amazing! A great way to see Basel and the Rhine River. My friends and I got great pictures from the top.",
          "a very well conserved Church... a must if you go to Basilea, the tiles in the roof rare but gives a different accent",
          "This is a beautiful church with two towers, sandstone architecture, and colorful tiles on the roof. It was originally a Catholic Church and is now a Protestant church. You can wander through the lovely courtyard with its pretty views. We were there in December and a charming",
          "Although not as ornate as many of the old European churches and cathedrals the Basel Minister is worth a visit.",
          "This is one of the top places to visit in Basel. it is a red brick gothic style church in a cobbled square. The building is superb both inside and out with beautiful stained glass windows.",
          "If you like walking through churches then you must go here when your visit Basle. The ceiling is beautiful.",
          "One of the main landmarks and tourist attractions in Basel. A gothic style church in the cobblestone square. Was closed when we were there, so could only admire the beauty from outside.",
          "We visited the Minster on our family holiday. While some of us looked inside the church three of the group including a six year old paid to climb up the stairs to the top of the steeple. They got great views. The Munster in quite dark inside and has beautiful stained glass",
          "Beautiful cathedral set in a cobbled square and with the Christmas market outside just now. I was lucky enough to visit when a prayer service was being held. You obviously can\u2019t walk round during that time but I sat and listened and the acoustics when the small congregation sang",
          "A very special attraction for everyone. Although it was evening,the place in front of it was quite crowded with tourists.",
          "It is a really beautiful place with life around and in center. All is really clean inside and outside.",
          "In the process of being renovated to its original glory. The exterior is stunning with a lot of 'stories' etched on the external walls. The interior is beautiful. It is a large running Church which holds regular services. You can access the towers were you can see over",
          "A typical cathedral with all the usual things to see. What was enjoyable was a trip up the tower at a cost of 5 sfr. I only made it the first balcony but the view was great and good for photos. The stairs up to this level are steep but you can pass others coming the other way.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. It's beautiful and the climb up to the top is worth the money. Lovely views over the city. Note the stairs are steep and narrow, bit of a squeeze at the top.",
          "If you are around you have to visit this building. It it probably more decorated from outside than from inside.",
          "The inside is not very interesting but go up the towers and the views are fantastic. We were there for the Christmas markets they are worth the visit.",
          "May as well pay a visit to the M\u00fcnster en route past. Compared to the other churches and cathedrals I have visited across this region, this is nothing really special.",
          "Make sure you go around the back as the view over the river is sensational as are the coats of arms and monuments to families of yore dating back to the 1600's. A lovely slice of history. The architecture is fantastic and make sure you check out Wikipedia for more information as",
          "Highly recommend climbing the Minister towers, very nice views and good exercise, there are a lot of narrow stairs to climb. Please note, that you can\u2019t go up there alone because of safety reasons.",
          "Very interest building and complex that adds perspective to Basel and its history. Convenient to the Old Town and worth a visit that will not take s Marge amount of time from your exploring day.",
          "It\u2019s a bit of a hike up the hill but worth it. The artistry especially the wood front piece and the jousting knight in front. The church had some lovely views from a couple blocks away.",
          "A great monument to discover. The outside view is rather \u201ccommon\u201d for a cathedral, but is still worthwhile for its use of the pink stone, typical for this region. The interiors are nice, although more common than what you would expect from a cathedral in some other countries",
          "The church is a photogenic building. The colourful roof tiles were interesting to me. We went up the steep stairs to the bell area. From there you walk outside and around to the very tight stairs to one of the top of the towers. We had some people passing us as we went up which",
          "I stay quite a lot in Basel for work, and have both had the opportunity to visit the Minster as well as pass the square on many occassions, where it is a centre-piece for outdoor cinema, the autumn festival and many other activities.",
          "Wonderful place. One of the most beautiful buildings in Basel. The exterior and it's red walls, sculptures, colourful roof are magnificent. You can climb to the top but only if you are with someone or in a group, not alone. Walk to the park behind and you will have a nice view",
          "Very lovely church. I was simply walking around the city, and suddenly stumbled upon it. Very nice inside, and there is quite a lot of space to cover if you go to the back open area (not sure what it's called). Lovely and picturesque--don't miss it!",
          "This cathedral is at the moment undergoing some work but I was able to visit inside. It has beautiful stained glass windows and oozes atmosphere. Outside it has other buildings open to the elements and a nice terrace with views over Basel. My grandsons also enjoyed visitn",
          "A Cathedral, a church or like here a Minster is a must on a city trip. From the outside it looks huge but it isn't compared with others. It's a kind of darkness inside",
          "Looking across the River Rhine, Basel Minster draws your eye and wonderment. Walk up through the Old Town, marvel at the glorious architecture en route and arrive in Meunsterplatz where this famous Minster lies. Whether you go in is immaterial as the walk and finish will",
          "A beautiful church with a fascinating history. However many tourists often overlook the most important part which is a tiny door in the back of the bottom floor. (I know because two friends of mine had been to the church two or three times and never through the little door!).",
          "I enjoy going to these old churches and this one did not disappoint. You can go down to the basement and see the old Roman foundation which the church is built on. You also must climb the bell tower, it is quite a hike but well worth it because the views are amazing. A must stop",
          "A very interesting place to visit. We did it as part of a walking tour. We liked it so much we went back later.",
          "This is absolutely one of the highlights of Bazel. A building which they started building in the 11th century. It has a great organ and we even went up in the tower, awesome!",
          "The only red stone minster we have seen so far, this beautiful cathedral set in its own square is very impressive.We have climbed many minsters, duomos and cathedrals, so found this climb relatively easy. Great views from the narrow platform. Unfortunately, we didnt realise",
          "Very beautiful and climbed to the top. Make sure you get to the top by 5. Doors to the top close at 4:30pm.",
          "The cathedral by is wonderful, was built between 1019 and 1500 in Romanesque and Gothic styles. The view from above is wonderful, not advised for those who are afraid of height or vertigo. And have a breath... The climb can only be done in pairs. I particularly think it is to",
          "This old church is very big. And it's a bit crowded. The highlight is walking to the top of the spires. It seems a little unsafe and you get sweaty and tired for sure. You walk up inside for a long while. Passign people is hard. Then you are outside on a super narrow",
          "The cathedral and surrounding grounds are serene, calming and spectacular. The tile roof is exquisite and beautiful. Going up each tower (there are 2) is well worth for the young at heart. Since it is a very old you will understand that the stairs are not modern, but that is",
          "It costs 5 Swiss Francs to climb the tower. The steps are a little precarious and very dark in places. But the views across Basel are well worth it. Highly recommended.",
          "Technically NOT a cathedral but a Minster this is a large imposing building. It is lovely to walk around in the cloisters with plaques marking the gravestones of prominent Basel families from the 16th century and then into the building itself. Once inside it feels like a church",
          "Very pretty stained glass windows with impressive architecture. Interesting history. Steps from Wettsteinbruke bridge for a great photo op with minster & river in background.",
          "Loved our tour around. I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to stop here, but if you are passing by it is worth walking in.",
          "This is one of the most unique, interesting and scenic ancient cathedrals/churches I have seen. It is full of history, architectural details and area scenery. Be sure to check in and all around this property when in Basel. I was particularly intrigued with the ancient unique",
          "Not only is the Muenster place and the Rhine view worth a visit. The gothic cathedral with its restored facade, its cloister and in particular the rediscovered crypt should not be missed. Regular light and sound shows in the crypt explain the cathedral\u2019s history - and that all",
          "Loved the place. Its architecture especially the extension of church is very good. It's like nothing I have seen in Europe. It reminded slightly of interior architecture of south Indian temples.",
          "I am continually amazed at the beauty and quality of the cathedrals throughout Europe. The Basel Minster certainly fits this catalog. I know after awhile they all kind of run together so make sure to take pictures so you can make notes on the differences when you get home.",
          "Magnificent old cathedral! Do not miss the crypts! The glass and ceiling work are spectacular! A guide does help to understand more of the history.",
          "The church is amazing, has an interesting architecture which looks old but new in the same time. The script is something you should see and don't miss to go on the other side of the church: you will enjoy an impressive view of Rhine river and Basel architectural buildings. There",
          "Went to Basel minster during my visit, and went up to the the top of it. Very exhausting and claustrophobic at points but well worth the view. You have to go up as 2 minimum to be aware, as my travel buddy didn\u2019t want to I went up with another British tourist that had come in",
          "This is really a very beautiful church and well worth a visit. I loved the roof tiles and the interior was stunning.",
          "Interesting church in the old town section of Basel.Great view of the Rhine behind the church. Notice that the spires don't match because of the length of time it took to build the church. Be sure to go down to the crypt where a video is projected on the walls showing the",
          "The Minster is build on 5 naves, with a beautiful gotic very sober with original painted windows. The organ is impressive, I am confident that a organ concert here will be superbe",
          "The majestic cathedral on the high bank of Rhein river. There are great organ, colonnade, huge mosaic windows. From inside yard the great view of the river and old Mittlere Brucke opens.",
          "It is a nice place to take pictures and hear a little bit of the history from basel. We did the visit during a walking tour",
          "Very interesting formerly Catholic cathedral, now a Protestant church. However, only German is shown, so it's helpful to have an English-speaking guide to give some of the history and stories. The view from the top is spectacular. From the overlook of the Rhine River you can",
          "Nice Gothic and Romanesque architecture. Interesting colored roof tiles. Very nice stained glass work and contains remains of Erasmus.",
          "It is a beautiful building, we couldn\u2019t go in as it was closed around 8.30- 9 in the morning. It has beautiful roof with tiles resembling colmar old buildings in green with red tiles design . Just behind the building is observation deck of the River. It has got beautiful view.",
          "We stumbled upon the beautiful Basel Minster while walking around Basel\u2019s old town. In the courtyard outside of the church are several contemporary sculptures by local artist Bettina Eichin, \u201cMarkttisch,\u201d amongst the historical plaques and markers. Well worth viewing when",
          "Beautiful cathedral overlooking the Rhine River. I had dinner at an outdoor restaurant facing the cathedral and afterwards walked behind the cathedral for a view of the Rhine. It was easy to get to. Just a short (uphill) walk from the Middle Bridge on a quaint street.",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral surrounded by winding narrow Medieval streets. The walk along Munsterbergstrasse from Freie Strasse to the Munsterplatz is especially charming. You could spend hours touring the classic interior of the cathedral and its incredible wood carvings but",
          "Totally worth a quick visit. Try going up the stairs to the top of one of the two towers if you are feeling fit. But watch your step! Totally worth it though. Awesome view from up there. Entrance to the lower levels is free, going up the stairs is no more than 5 CHF depending",
          "The Basel Minster is quite a church. It was interesting to hear the history of the transition from a Catholic church to a Protestant one. This year marks the 1000 anniversary so there are laser displays that reveal past decorations in the church. Erasmus is buried here. However,",
          "The architecture is amazing. The strained glass is quite beautiful. Get a guided tour to learn all the is about this beautiful church. There is an amazing pipe organ and they still hold services on Sunday. Go around to the back to get a lovely view of the Rhine river. Erasmus is",
          "I love European churches and this was exceptional. The square outside is wonderful, and the outer building is super interesting. I loved being able to go downstairs to see the excavations and feel the history.",
          "The building itself has a long history and it is quite impressive both inside and out and it is situated in a nice square on an elevated site. Erasmus of Rotterdam is buried here. There is a great view of the city across the Rhine from the Pfalz behind the cathedral. There is a",
          "Started as a Catholic church then past to Presbyterians after reformation. Lovely architecture and stained glass windows. Beautiful stonework.",
          "Majestic place. Great view opens to the city. I haven\u2019t gone inside the cathedral, but the courtyard had interesting sculptures",
          "After settling into our hotel across from the central train station in Basel, we headed out to explore the city on foot, especially the older part of the city. After a short 15 minute walk thru some quaint city streets we arrived at the Cathedral that was built between 1019 and",
          "We just stopped in here as we were passing by. Very interesting ceiling and we happened in while there was a small service going on with music. Lovely.",
          "We climbed the 250 or so steps up to the top, and Oh what a view! The steps are small/steep, and you don't want to rush. The climb is great excercise, and worth the effort.",
          "Stopped in here on a MON afternoon on our walk through old town area. Several stained glass windows that are very pretty. We did not go up in the tower.",
          "Interesting old church built in the Gothic style situated in the center of town, important relics of saints and tombs of the senior clergy.",
          "One of the better churches that we have visited with some great views and some really great history. We visited with our local guide on a walking tour which helped heaps with understanding more about this church.",
          "The Munster is very nice inside but not remarkable. The best bit is the views from the towers you can climb both but I guess the views are similar . The roof is great to look down on with it`s colourful tiles. Views up and down the Rhine are spectacular . Entry is free the tower",
          "We have visited several churches and cathedrals of this type. This is a typical one with a nice view over the Rhein river.",
          "The Minster is a beautiful building, which welcomes visitors without charging them. It is a place of worship, and it is a joy to experience the quiet atmosphere and take a seat to reflect or pray. It has impressive stained glass windows and an unusual pulpit hanging from the",
          "Nothing special really. I usually like visiting places like it but for some reason didn\u2019t enjoy it. Hammering Man is much more interesting",
          "This is a dramatic and beautiful place, inside & out. It has different color stones apparently because once it was demolished by an earth quake. There's a very large plaza in front of the Minster. Apparently during the summer (when I did not visit) there are movies, music and",
          "beautiful inside and out. some of the nicest stained glass i have seen and you can get really close up to them.",
          "No word needed, if you are in Basel you must see the \u201cM\u00fcnster\u201d as they call it here. Made of beautiful red sandstone like many other historical buildings in the region, it\u2019s a fine example of gothic architecture. Nice acoustics inside for singing! (I had the privilege to have",
          "Beautiful old cathedral sitting above the Rhine and offering unrivalled views around the city. The cathedral itself has the most incredible stain glass windows and the tower can be accessed for around 5CHF. The cathedral itself is free and every effort should be made to visit",
          "Enjoyed a stroll around the cloister and the walk over looking the river. We were there on Easter Sunday and the main church was not open to visitors.",
          "Basel Minster is absolutely gorgeous! It\u2019s situated in a beautiful square with nice coffee places, so you can contemplate the magnificence of it! We\u2019re there for good Friday and we\u2019re lucky enough to watch a Matth\u00e4us Passion concert, absolutely worth it, it\u2019s as beautiful and",
          "Walking around Basel and decided to visit Basel Minster. We are glad we did. We went in and paid 5 CHF to go up. Such a great experience going up the narrow staircase to the top. The view from the top is stunning. Make sure to open all the doors as it is not marked well",
          "The Basel cathedral resides high over theRhine river. It is constructed in the tipical warm red sanstone of the region. The main facade dominates a cosy place surrounded by anciant buildings without any modern supplementations. The facade is ornamented by a statue of St. George",
          "I've seen many cathedrals over the years on my travels. This one is less impressive, but if you're in the area, go and check it out.",
          "I\u2019ve seen a lot of churches and this fitted in the middle, nothing special but it did have beautiful windows so absolutely worth stopping by",
          "Old cathedral in gothic style. Beautiful and simple, with impressive stained glasses and galleries. The lower part is closed to the public.",
          "Maybe I've seen too many churches the last 2 weeks, but this one didn't stand out. Most intesting thing is that it had 680 wood chairs (no pews) and everyone is carved differently",
          "This church is an attractive building, situated in the older part of the city. It is built in a lovely red sandstone and stands on the banks of the Rhine. It was a Sunday when we visited so there was a service in progress and we were unable to see the interior. However, we were",
          "We were walking around looking for a view of the river. If you go behind this church either through the courtyard or the Northside walking path it leads down a great view of the river. A must see!!",
          "Went there during the faschnacht which filled the area with lanterns. The cathedral is great for taking pictures and the view from the garden is also a worthy experience. A great stop on a tour of Basel",
          "Basel Munster is a beautiful cathedral in the old town, with some stunning stained glass windows. It is also wonderfully located, with a view point just next to it, and a bronze model of the Munster itself outside. Worth visiting as part of an exploration of the town.",
          "It is located in a lovely area, a special cathedral which was destroyed in an earthquake and rebuilt again. A must see before diving into the old town and shopping street.",
          "High up in he hill overlooking the city and river this nice architecture I was amazed with the size and way that it was built",
          "Come here for overall view of town of Basel. Cathedral is nice. Deep halls with nice 2 towers to climb up. It\u2019s 5 Swiss Francs. And on way up the stairs become more narrow, at one point only single file can go up while people coming down had to wait. Upon climbing you see",
          "The catheral is located along the river and is easily accessible from city centre. The building looks impressive and allows good city view if Basel. Lots of history can be found and it\u2019s a must see if you are in the city.",
          "Built between the 11th and 16th centuries in the Romanesque and Gothic styles, it is characteristic because of its red sandstone architecture and slim twin towers at its sides. It also features a nice cloister.",
          "Worth a visit chiefly for its elevated location over the Rhine. An adjacent terrasse allows for an atmospheric view of the Rhine river.",
          "Hard to miss the Basel Cathedral close to the river Rhein. Walking up there coming from the Mittlere Bruecke you have a lovely view of Basel. The location is also a great place if you are planning attending the famous Basler Fastnacht opening and the annual Christmas Market in",

          "Nice to see inside and out and is located at the top of a hill which behind the building provides a good view of the rivers d bridges. We didn\u2019t have to pay anything and I think it was just a coin donation that helped to cover renovations. in winter I would advise to wear warm",
          "High on a hill over the Danube, the Basel Cathedral offers a lovely view of Basel. Be sure to check out the sundial clock. In December, it is the location of one of Basel's Christmas Markets.",
          "If You could see one of interesting monument in Basilej, You have to visit Basel Munster. There are the tomb of Erasmus Rotterdamsky",
          "We stopped in to take a look at the interior and found out they were having a pipe organ recital that evening at 6 pm. We have learned that you need to arrive early to these things in Europe. The line started about an hour before. It was about 30 degrees out and people are",
          "We stopped here on the way from Freiburg to Bern, we find parking garage out of the city and walked across mitlere bridge to the cathedral. Actually from metre bridge we walked up to cathedral through the shopping busy street passing by city hall Rathaus. On the way back we",
          "Architecturally charming this is a place of quiet contemplation (which is currently the subject of a renovation project).",
          "In a good location, right on the river and easy to find. Outside looked beautiful, but very disappointed as it was closed. We visited on Tuesday 11th Decenber. Small Xmas market outside in munsterplatz",
          "We stumbled across the Minster and went inside to explore. Inside we found a choir and orchestra setting up and what followed was a fantastic show to a small audience. AMAZING. You really made our visit to Switzerland special.",
          "The M\u00fcnster a former Cathedral- now a protestant church is a landmark in Basel. It rises high above the river Rhein When in Basel spend some time to visit the Munster. It was a former Cathedral, but changed later in a protestant church. It\u2019s build in different styles and they",

          "Basel Munster, like many European cathedrals, is very beautiful. It may not be as old as many of the others, but it is interesting in it\u2019s own right. It is well worth a visit when in Basel.",
          "Very nice place especially with the Christmas market ! I am convinced that it\u2019s a place to go and visit. Also there is a very nice view behind the church - don\u2019t forget to have a look ! I recommend to see it during the Christmas season!",
          "As with most churches in Europe, this one should not be missed. It is not particularly ornate, but it is still worth a trip.",

          "Europe is full of cathedrals, but this one is in Basel which was where our Rhine River cruise terminated. For 5 francs per person, you can climb one spire of this cathedral. Be prepared for some really steep stairs and narrow passages though. This is NOT a handicapped accessible",
          "If You will be in Basel You must visit this church. Beautiful interiors and good nois for christmas songs",

          "The courtyard outside the M\u00fcnster transforms into a Christmas market from Nov 22 till Dec 23. Can shop while being amazed by the architecture of the M\u00fcnster. I often wonder how many manhours we into the construction of churches like this.",
          "You can't avoid noticing it when in Basel. Pay it a visit when air is clean to enjoy a nice view over Reno river and town surroundings.",
          "Nice to visit for some quiet contemplation. As a Church of the Reformation it is quite plain inside but has some nice stained glass and tiled roofs.",
          "This was one of the sites I wanted to see in Basel. We were lucky enough to stop in as their choir and orchestra was rehearsing for Christmas musicals. It was nice to rest for a bit and enjoy the music. A must is to climb both bell towers. Steps are a bit narrow and the",
          "As shown on photos. Just the Christmas Markets closes before 8.30pm... Nice decor and atmosphere if you go earlier though.",
          "I booked to go to Basel for the Christmas markets, there was 5 adults in total, we flew with easy jet, really inexpensive seats, it worked out at \u00a354 return each, that was with bags and pre booked seats. We arrived in Basel and took the number 50 tram, which is literally right",

          "Everyone should spend some time visiting this beautiful church. The architecture and stained glass windows are difficult to describe. Well worth the visit.",
          "Our favourite thing to do in Basel. Beautiful views on multiple levels up the towers, and to see the detail of the building. Costs 5 CHF per adult. Went on Saturday, closes at 4pm, but we noticed they closed admission from about 3.30. Highly recommended!",
          "The cathedral is up the hill, but worth the trek to visit the inside, including the cloister! The view from the back is worth it as well.",
          "What a beautiful sprawling church. My goal is to climb the stairs and look over the city through the bell tower. But not today, because not only did they crush my spirits but they reminded me I was single ;-) It is some strange liability thing but it made me feel crappy.",
          "Close from the hotel we stayed. We felt the history of this Cathedral. Getting in to it, there is breathtaking glass which has a good contrast to sculptures on the facade. It is built on the cliff along the Rhine, and the view from the Cathedral is very scenic. You will see a",
          "We had a wonderful visit to the Basel Munster. I was especially awed by the views from the top of the towers of the cathedral. However, you cannot to up to the top alone due to safety considerations. In other words, visitors must go up in a group of two or more people so folks",
          "The location is two minutes from about any downtown location it is of course an Impressive church They were attendance in the church that would answer any questions you had about the history",
          "Very spiritual and peaceful place. Nice architecture, I'd say Gothic. The whole area around the Cathedral is worth visiting.",
          "Lovely little church to pop in and look up. We did not know there was a plot from higher up that we could have climbed up to otherwise we would have as we understand the views were very nice from there.",
          "We went for a long walk on our last night in Basel, and found our way to this place. Of course we didn't get to see the inside, but the view of the river made up for it. Truly spectacular.",
          "a beautiful, especially the stained glass, interesting church to visit, centuries of history to explore., with helpful staff.",
          "We have visited several Gothic Cathedrals in recent weeks , but the Basel Munster really is a bit different , lovely stained glass ( some of it quite modern ) , and an unusual small chapel behind the alter , impressive organ loft , lovely hand carved oak furniture , all subtly",
          "This cathedral is over 800 years old and in amazing condition. Great Photos can be obtained from the Rhine bridge. Visitors can eat a sandwich on the open courtyard overlooking the Rhine. The 200 year old tombs and their inscriptions are particularly artistic and intriguing.",
          "No visit to the Basel Munster would be complete without a great camera, and good historic guide book or guide. Situated on one of the hills overlooking the city, the Cathedral stands tall and beautiful; more like a Guardian Angel than a Sentinel. We were surprised that the",
          "This austere mass sits dominating its site on the Rhine, adjacent to several favourite spots where, if the weather allows, visitors can linger and relax away from the buzz. The crypt is much older than i had realised, some tombs dating back to the tenth century and with fading",
          "Switzerland had \"no war\", so churches are still in original form. Visit the tower for a nice view over Basel",
          "With its red sandstone walls, colorful roof tiles and twin towers, no other building adorns the cityscape of Basel like the Cathedral. There are many cathedrals in Europe and it is easy to take them for granted. This one is outstanding and is the centerpiece of Old Town. Nice",
          "Amazing find ,worth a wonder round noentrance charge which is rare these days .stunning architecture",
          "The kinda pinkish color of the Basler Munster reminded me of the one in Strasbourg, also kinda pinkish. The place, where the Munster is located, is really great: quite high above the river Rheine, so you can overlook the winding of the Rhein to the north and the south. Many",
          "We did not use the audio guide. However we found the architecture, windows, and tombs to be very interesting. Helps if you can read German and Latin. Tomb/memorial for Erasmus is easy to miss. Be sure to go down into the level below the main church. There are wonderful old",
          "Anyone visiting Basel will want to visit this icon of the city. It's a little personal for me having been baptized there as a child. However, it remains the first place my wife and I visit when we're in Basel. Many of us in the US have no concept of age. That comes to the",
          "On our visit to Basel my partner and I decided to have a nose about the Basel Munster, they offer for 10 CHF per person for you to climb the Munster tower and make your way to the top with some of the best views of the city. Highly recommend if you're not scared of heights and",
          "Very beautiful sand stone Church originally catholic but now reformed protestant .There is an open terrace in the back of the church affords the view of the Rhine River. The church shows the effects of Romanesque & Gothic styles which were popular at that time. This area",
          "Spent a very enjoyable hour walking around the Munster and it's insides. Very good views outside as well. Luckily we had a guide who told us lots of useful information.",
          "Whau ... what a view... from the tower you have a view to 3 countries... amazing... but you should be trained, the steps and the walk upstairs are not for everybody. But would recommend it any way.",
          "Red sandstone architecture and coloured roof tiles. Originally a Catholic cathedral and today a Reformed Protestant church, it was built in Romanesque and Gothic styles, very old place, more than thousand years. Good view even behind cathedral on Rhine river.",
          "Great view just near the church. Lot of place to rest in a shade of trees. In a walking distance from Rathaus and Main station.",
          "See it at night and again during the day. It amazes me how beautiful it is and how it just doesnt fit one frame. The inside of the church is worth visiting too. Photography is allowed.",
          "Basel Munster is not as impressive a some of the grander French and Italian cathedrals but is worth the visit to appreciate the differences in architectural and style in cathedrals across the continent.",
          "The church sits right on the river and has a good view. Church was closed both days we were there due to symphony practicing for a concert that evening, very disappointing.",
          "This is well worth a visit when in Basel. Situated next to the river and a bustling old square, there is a lovely vibe here. Take a quiet stroll and enjoy the stunning 15th century architecture.",
          "Situated on a hill above river Rhine. Built between 1019 and 1500 as a Catholic cathedral and today a Reformed Protestant church. It is the top historical and architectural sight in Basel. Of course a must visit. The cloister behind has lovely gardens, beautifully arched",
          "It looks better from Kleinbasel of when crossing on the ferry. Very picturesque and the neighbouring Munsterplatz is a beautiful cobbled square to sit and take a rest under the trees.",
          "Although different to French and English cathedrals, it is well worth a visit, with an outstanding view of the Rhine to the rear of the building.",
          "Definitely worth a visit to this beautiful church. Originally a catholic cathedral and now a reformed Protestant Church, it was built between the 11th and 15th century in Romanesque and Gothic styles. It towers above the city skyline and is listed as a heritage site if national",
          "We always visit the local historic churches, so compared to others this is a fairly plain structure. However, behind it there is a lovely treed terrace area overlooking the river. If you are up to a steep stair climb you can go down to the river and take the ferry to the other",
          "Gothic building with great architecture. We were able to get great picture of the river Rhine from the Cloisters. Good activity for all the family.",
          "Absolutely amazing views from the tower. Too bad that the \"lady\" from the entrance was rude and patienceless to hear our simple questions.",
          "Beatifull view from the top of the church. I would say a 'must visit place' once in Basel. Was there in summmer, the view was awesome would love to see the same view in winter :)",
          "We took a 2 hr walking tour the day before (got 50% off the price with the hotels Basel card= $100 then visited the Munster the next day. well worth the $4 to get to the top- quite a hike and a little claustrophobic but well worth it.",
          "A must see! There is no charge to see the beautiful architecture of the cathedral inside and out. For a small fee and a fair amount of leg work, you are able to climb to the very base of both spires. The 360 panoramic view is simply amazing. You are also able to see many of",
          "Visible from several points along the Rhine the Basel Muster is also on one of the five walking tours described in the leaflet available from the tourist office. It takes a little effort to get up the hill from the city centre but worth a visit. Also includes a small terrace at",
          "Beautiful cathedral in Basel. Views are spectacular once you you have made the trek up the many many stairs. If you are afraid of heights or claustrophobic this may not be the best option for you. I would recommend leaving your backpack or large bag at the ticket desk. It can",
          "Part of our guided city walking tour , it was admirable to see the nice architectural design of the church . Our tour guide gave us a brief history and she handled it well . Pressed with time however we regret not being able to see more the inside .",
          "Interesting visit while strolling old town. Can also visit top of the towers. Interesting part of the history.",
          "Beautiful church with a lot of glass stained windows, very high ceiling and space to just wander, take pictures or enjoy the silence. Seating is available for those who want to sit and reflect. Free of charge.",
          "The defining architectural feature in Basel, a classic cathedral (though interesting change between Norman and Gothic styles), but most things of note have been removed from inside. Good view of river and a very nice cloisters, so worth a visit, but if you are into cathedrals,",
          "Paid a few euro to go up to the top. It takes forever. The stairs are rickety which kind of adds to the charm. You think you\u2019re at the top but you can walk around the edge and go up further towers. I have never been afraid of heights, in fact I like heights but I was terrified",
          "Lovely building, we really enjoyed the crypts. We did climb the tower - mum couldn't make it past the midway balcony - it was a rickety climb but a great medieval tower with a huge bell and amazing views.",
          "I live just 10 min away from Basel Munster and thoroughly enjoy my night walks witnessing this majestic beauty by the river. She reflects the seasons and lights up my spirit :)",
          "Well worth a wander around the munster and environs. Some good statues on the exterior and the cloister is lovely. Highlight for us was the tower and views it offers some lovely steep wooden sections but mostly easy enough. Quite tight on the first external level but great",
          "One of the key sights of Basel. Looks huge on outside. Inside it is simple but has great stained glass windows. A must see destination but you do not need to spend a lot of time.",
          "Basel - a small but amazing Swiss town, streets and surrounding are a Swiss trademark all clean and everything in place, People are nice and landscapes very green",
          "This square is one of the main squares in Basel. It holds lots of museum and one of the best schools around. The square has lots of history, old building and the beautiful view of the Rhine River. My kids study at the M\u00fcnsterplatz school and I often visit the square. During",
          "Situated overlooking the Rhine and gradually being restored. An extraordinarily ancient door/archway. My daughter was married outside here to her Swiss husband so it was a thrill to see Basel Munster.",
          "Nice pictures of the incoming light. Quiet church. Free entrance. Bright Sunday morning. Start of the day!",
          "We visited here during our stay in Basle. There are wonderful views of the city and the Rhine from outside the Cathedral. The building itself is very impressive and it is possible to climb up the tower to get a better view of Basle and the surrounding area.",
          "I was a bit surprised that the Muenster is as small as it is. The ceilings, as with other gothic structures, was very high, but the nave itself is quite short. There are some lovely stained glass windows, but not very many. I\u2019ve seen much more impressive gothic cathedrals.",
          "Spend the few euros and walk up the tower. The views of the river and city are magic and it will keep you fit as you over indulge on holiday!",
          "The best part of this cathedral is the climb up the tower. For only 5 francs each, and a steep climb up many winding stairs, you are rewarded with a beautiful panoramic view of the city! FYI there is a free public restroom in the courtyard outside of the cathedral.",
          "Interesting inside and outside. Nice pedestrian area around. Don't miss the fountains. Worth a visit.",
          "Entry to the church is free. The tower costs extra, but is worth the money. You will have a great view from up there.",
          "The Basel Munster, once a Roman Catholic Cathedral during the Middle Ages, after the Reformation transferred to the Swiss Reformed Church. It is now an austere albeit impressive building inside since all the previous Roman Catholic statues and decorations have been since",
          "Second time there, and still amazing! My son went to the top, views where spectacular!! A wonderful place to sit and contemplate.",
          "A nice church! Is a Catholic with barock stile if I remember well ...so you need to visit these church if your go in Swiss",
          "This is an amazingly Church. The multicolored roof is very unique and looks beautiful. Worth a visit.",
          "Loved this beautiful cathedral. If you have the energy, you must climb to the top of the tower. Many narrow steps but huge reward at the top. Unbelievable views.",
          "At one of the higher points in Basel the Church seems enormous from the outside. Despite being a little overgrown inside it house some wonderful gravestones.",
          "The Cathedral in Basel is well worth visiting. It is a very impressive and ancient structure whose two towers are symbolic of the city. The plain interior suggests it is impacted by the Reformation, as does the memorial plaque commemorating Erasmus. We visited on a very hot and",
          "We went and checked out he Cathedral during our day walking around the city. We were very glad we visited. The Cathedral is very beautiful. The walk through the surrounding area is great. Once you get to the Cathedral the views from there are amazing.",
          "A beautiful structure while visiting Basil. The architecture is breathtaking. I recommend to other travelers",
          "This was my favorite must see in Basel. So much history, it\u2019s beautiful and it\u2019s free to roam and explore. Zum Isaak is a great place to eat right across from the church.",
          "The church itself is beautiful perched up on the hill. But take the time to climb up to the steeples. What a beautiful view of the river and town. But even better is seeing the different types of construction used to make the stairs to reach the steeples-wood,masonry, iron. But",
          "- beautiful and quaint cathedral - nice plaza with some good restaurants around - also suggest a walk down to the riverfront just behind the cathedral and taking the Rhine boat crossing trip",
          "We lucked out and happened upon a concert. It was delightful. The church is beautiful and worth a trip to visit. Wasn\u2019t difficult to walk to.",
          "Lovely cathedral, but it closed exactly at 5, so we wound up with only 10 minutes to wander. I hadn't researched, but though it would be open later. I never had the chance to find where Erasmus was.",
          "I love touring old religious structures. It is just as lovely on the inside as it is from the outside. There was no crowd and no charge to get in. Sit awhile and enjoy the cooler temperature on a hot summer day.",
          "After two weeks in Europe, my eyes began to glaze when touring yet another cathedral. Gothic? Romanesque? They were all blurring together. The Basel Munster, however, is different. For one thing, Erasmus is buried there. For another, the cloisters are marvelous, a peaceful",
          "This is a good example of the transition from sturdy, rounded Romanesque architecture to Gothic with its more vertical emphasis and pointed rather than rounded arches. There is not a lot of art inside the church as it has been converted from Catholic to Reformed. But one can see",
          "This is a commanding and beautiful landmark in Basel. We walked in right as an organ concert was about to begin so it gave us the opportunity to sit and relax while enjoying the music and the beautiful stained glass windows. There was also a breezy cloister area that is open on",
          "Hadn't planned on visiting but glad we did, found this architectural novelty wandering through the old town",
          "Unless you want to go up the tower or look at the view from the wall overlooking the river this is not worth the effort. There is nothing to see inside this ex-cathedral.",
          "Located on a hill above the Rhine, this Muenster should be visited both for its red sandstone beauty and for its role as the resting place of that great humanist, Disiderius Erasmus, also known as Erasmus of Rotterdam. The outside statuary is particularly fine: St George slaying",
          "I visited the Munster with a friend recently and we were both struck by it's beauty, inside and out. We felt that climbing one of the spires was not to be missed and we were rewarded by fantastic views of Basel architecture and the Rhine from the top. The 200 or so steps were",
          "Was blown away by the architecture of this building, it really is beautiful both outside and inside. Fabulous!",
          "My husband and I recently visited Basel, and we went to the church to check it out. The inside is beautiful, but somewhat simple. We loved the statue of St. George and the Dragon on the front of the church. We climbed to see the view from the bell tower. Please note that to",
          "I really suggest a visit at the Muster, it is really a beautiful Cathedral and from the tower you have a wonderful view.",
          "huge building with stairs{small charge} to top of tower ,very steep though but good views of basel from top",
          "ABC of European churches--Another Beautiful Church. (Although we have heard other acronymns.) At the time, they had a contemporary art installation that was a wonderful juxtaposition to the medieval building. Worth the climb up to the top spires.",
          "There's no pressure of heavy hiking around the old town of Basel ,and reaching the top of the hill where the magnificent Basel Misnter is located ,is very easy ,unless you had the luck to get lost in the expensive boutiques on Freie Strasse ,where the price is all pricy .",
          "Our family of three decided to take a day trip to Basel from Freiburg (via train). We weren't sure what we were going to do, but the two cathedral towers in the distance caught our eye and we found our way to Basel Munster. Knowing nothing about it, we thought we were walking",
          "This is a must see. Make sure you pay the small fee to gain access to the towers. The climb requires agility and is VERY tight but you will be rewarded with spectacular views of the city. Even though the stairwell is very narrow make sure you go all the way to the top...you",
          "Interesting church with an open crypt, some crypts dating back to 900 AD. Colorful tiled roof and unique statues, basilisk?, on the outside.",
          "Visited as part of a walking tour of the old town. Interesting to learn of the history, not only of the Munster, but of Basel.",
          "Very big and imposing cathedral and annexes. The cathedral is nicer from the outside than from the inner side.",
          "We loved visiting the Basel Munster. If in Basel this is a must see. The history is amazing and the building so well preserved. The grounds around the Munster were beautifull as well looking out over the Rhine River.",
          "We were told we had to visit. It is a landmark in Basel. So glad we did. Choir was practicing before 4:30 Saturday vesper Service.",
          "We had read that noon hour prayers were offered at this cathedral. We decided to time our visit to that. We were handed a program with the words and music to follow along with the order of servic. We were wondering how the singing would sound with just a few people",
          "Beautiful exterior. Amazing roof tiles. Lots of history. Imposing size. In a beautiful Platz & great to view from across the Rhine",
          "We didn't visit the inside Catedral, but the building is very beautiful. Main atraction of the Old Town.",
          "Located in the city center. Quite large, majestic and significant. Interestingly, you can climb the balustrade of the Cathedral and the tower (for a fee). At the top you can see stone carved figures decorating the Cathedral from a close distance. Also on top of a wonderful view",
          "Lovely cathedral to visit, free to get in. Architecture is stunning , high up so from the terrace at the rear you get great views of Basel and the river , also at the rear it has steps down to a ferry crossing for the short trip to the other side, a don\u2019t miss when visiting Basel",
          "Not to be missed. Highly recommended. The cathedral has an interesting history and dominates the hill overlooking the city. Great views outside over the river.",
          "I went to Basel in a rainy day and felt so pissed off because of the weather. But I decided to take a stroll around the river and found the Basel Munster very quiet and lovely. It is not special, since I've been to a lot of church before, but still love it.",
          "So if you are into organs the minster in Basel has a cracker. There are recitals over the summer (I went last Sunday at 6pm) and the resident organists plays at 12.05 during certain months. Check out the website and don\u2019t be surprised if the place is almost full!",
          "Don\u2019t miss the river view in back of the church. The old foundation diggings were closed on this Monday. Most museums in Basel are closed on Monday.",
          "The interior of the church and the church as a whole does not compare with the great cathedral cities of Europe.",
          "Yes it\u2019s been raining all week, but we still had to see this site. The stone and wood are amazing. The cloisters where beautiful.",
          "Basel Munster is tucked away behind the main shopping streets and well with the effort of finding it. Standing tall above a peaceful square with some fine stain glass windows.",
          "This gem is hidden behind the main shopping high street on the river. A wonderful piece of Basel\u2019s religious history. Apparently you can climb to the top but there was a service taking place when we visited so we could not enter beyond the front foyer. We paired this visit",
          "It is a beautiful square and church. Everytime I go to Basel I visit Basel Munster. It has a beautiful view over the river Rhine. Climbing to tower was really difficult. It has really tight stairs and a bit dark. I was really scared but in the end it has a beautiful view and has",
          "Being from the US, it is always amazing to see the fabulous architecture that is hundreds of years old. Love hearing the history of these exquisite buildings. Old town Basel is very easily reached by a couple of light rail lines (number 6 goes through downtown and also goes to",
          "We stopped to have breakfast and walk around the town. With most places of interest within walking interest it was a neat place to be and we loved the ambience of breakfasting on the street.",
          "This was a neat place to visit and adds to the historic feel of Basel. Easy walking distance to most parts of town.",
          "Wonderful square where you can sit and look with a beer. Entry free and some lovely stained glass windows. From the cloisters you can have great views across the Rhine.",
          "A wonderful attraction in Basel. Beautiful gothic catehdral that we definitely recommend visiting. You don't have to spend more than a half hour to an hour in here. Great photo opportunities in this catehdral with amazing stained glass windows throughout. Great view of the",
          "Massive Romanesque and early gothic church. Not particularly ornate but a few exceptionally lovely choir stalls and capitals on pillars.",
          "Visited this church which sits on a plaza with a park area next door on one side. The other side holds an area where art and religious artifacts are displayed. When we were there we could hear signing; a rehearsal perhaps. Nice experience.",
          "Sitting in the square having a beer and looking at the wonderful scenery was a highlight of our trip- and the views from the top of Basel Munster are absolutely amazing. It is very reasonably priced (5 Swiss francs) to climb to see the views, but the stairs are very narrow,",
          "We were lucky enough to step inside this church while the organist was playing on a Friday afternoon.",
          "This is a beautiful church chalk with history. Pay 5 Francs to \u201cclimb\u201d the tower. However, this is a difficult climb for those who are not steady on their feet. And there is a requirement of 2 people at a time, you cannot climb alone. The stairwells are very narrow and you will",
          "it was great walking around the Munster and great view of Rhein peaceful and Loved the clock. worth a visit.",
          "A great architecture site in the heart of the city. Worth going to see the building, but highly recommend paying the CHF5 to climb the Spire for the best views of Basel!",
          "What this cathedral lacks in size and splendour it more than makes up in atmosphere. Situated on the bank of the Rhine it looks great from the river and from the square in front of it. The inside is full of character with an atmosphere to rival the best churches in Europe.",
          "It is clearly one of the highlights of this beautiful city. The views of Basel Munster are stunning. I'm glad I experienced it!",
          "The biggest must-see in Basel, and if you want to get a true sense of its purpose, you should pop along to midday prayers each day at 12 for 20 minutes. It\u2019s in German but it\u2019s easy to follow and they will help you if you\u2019re stuck. The building is magnificent, in a Protestant",
          "I love this church. When I studied abroad in Germany, we would travel to Basel and spend the afternoon in the church courtyard. The view of the Rhein River is breath taking and totally worth seeing from the church. Also, musicians and dancers would perform in the yard and it",
          "Basel is famous for its industries but is a beautiful city for leisure too. Sharing borders with France and Germany it's an ideal stay if you are planning to visit Paris and Black forest. The bullet train from Zurich to Paris passes through Basel. For Black forest you can hop",
          "Great, old church with awesome views overlooking the Rhine River. Very nice keepers in the church. We arrived there late and a kind gentleman offered to personally escort us first thing the next morning.",
          "Basel Munster Cathedral with breathtaking views of the Rhein,the Kleinbasel district, the black forest & the Vosges. Dates back to the 15 century. We climbed up to the tower not for the light hearted as the platform is very narrow to walk around.",
          "Great building to look at, perfect views from the river. Would definitely recommend seeing this one.",
          "Nice cathedral and worth a visit but the climb up through the tower to get a full 360 view of basel was very enjoyable.",
          "I was there for a prayer/ mass and the inside is truly beautiful. If you go around the church you have a beautiful view on the river and of you enter behind you\u2019ll see a small garden and a miniature 3D version of the city. I can only recommend visiting.",
          "Very beautiful. We were there when there was a street carnival and we were disappointed that many of the rides and attractions blocked the view of the building however it was great for photos on the river side.",
          "Basel is a wonderful place, the munster place is fantastic... I just feel the old history of the town and this place is a must!",
          "This is not a unique place, but it is a beautiful place to go, to see, to spend some quiet time paying attention to every single detail. It is the mirror os Basel history; it is the mirror of some kind of evolution in art; and it is the mirror of the past, the present and maybe",
          "We booked this break without checking what was going on, we arrived 20th Feb in the middle of Fasnacht. All shops closed for the parade. We found eating in Basel very expensive, one hot chocolate, one coffee and two below average hotdogs 26 chf, about & \u00a321. We found most cafes",
          "Worth a short visit after using the ferry across the Rhine but very little to see and quite a simplistic church when compared to many other famous churches in Europe - it kind of typifies Basel - simple but pleasant with not too much to see",
          "As a citizen of Basel I have visited the Munster, our Cathedral, several times over the years. However, the special atmosphere of this clerical building dating back to Gothic and even Romanesque times is particularly impressive at night. An experience you get when you visit the",
          "A major landmark above the River Rhein Basel M\u00fcnster is free to enter. It\u2019s not that big inside but you can climb up and gain access to outdoor balconies of the towers affording great views of the river on one side and the City on the other.",
          "The building stands tall at the side of the river & you will definitely take photos of it. Inside the architecture is lovely & well worth time out to take a look. There are some interesting sculptures inside as well as a great view across the river.",
          "The architecture is truly beautiful and quite breathtaking. The use of colour is dominant and powerful and reflects the feelings evoked upon entering.",
          "An old impressive basilica with very beautiful architecture and drawings, the place is magical. From inside is glorious and it has a small indoor garden From outside, there is a side where you can enjoy a marvelous view of the Reihne Highly recommended for sightseeing lovers",
          "This is a magnificent large church with Romanesque and Gothic phases, set dramatically on a height above the Rhine. There is a fine square in front of it, surrounded by old houses, and a scenic terrace behind the apse. The interior was stripped of most monuments and furnishings",
          "We heard quite a bit about this place. Not much to do here. So if you want to see beautiful Switzerland you can skip this place.",
          "A church has been on this site for close to 1000 years and the building in its current guise is around 500 to 600 years old. The building is not huge but it is very accessible and well worth a visit. The stained glass windows an the organ are lovely, the tower can be climbed for",
          "Awesome place a must see while in Basel. There was a little market with rides for children and food trailers. A very festive atmosphere. You have to be prepared to walk up a very steep cobblestone street to get there.",
          "Very nice place to visit - beautiful windows - nice view from the cloister side - nice little shop - possibility to visit tower",
          "Nice munster at the top of the hill in a nice cobbled area. Not a lot to see inside but the outside has a couple of nice carvings including st george running a dragon through. The view across the river out the back is nice and you can go down the steps to the little ferry boat",
          "This cathedral is beautiful, inside and out, and located on a lovely square in Basel. At the time of my visit, a Christmas Market was being held on the square, which made my visit even more special and festive. A must-see!",
          "The cathedral is lovely. At the end of my river cruise found out that there was a free organ concert in the cathedral. The acoustics were wonderful and the two organ players were amazing.",
          "Great architecture great city. Kai many cities.to visit nearby Basel is. Very nice place Nd strasburg is near",
          "We visited for Christmas Eve carols with the town band in the Munster square. There had just been a concert with local youth. It's a very traditional place with a Christmas Market in the square.",

          "Loved the stained glass loved this cathedral it\u2019s serene peaceful and much visit place in Basel. Unfortunately when I visited there was a film crew and also know that on Sunday the church closes at 4 pm. You can climb all the way to the top such a brilliant view as well",
          "Climbing to thr top of the tower is a must if you are ok with narrow and small spaces. The view of the rhine from the top of the tower is well worth it.",
          "Hosting one of the largest, and by far the prettiest Christmas Market in Switzerland. Taking over Barf\u00fcsserplatz and M\u00fcnsterplatz in the heart heart of the festively decorated Old Town, through Advent all the way to Christmas, packed with spectacular events and special",
          "A tour of Europe must include a visit to its many cathedrals as they often encompass the history of the city and the region. A magnificent example!",
          "Amazing masterpiece of gothic architecture in the heart of the old city. Definitely recommend seeing",
          "Stunningly beautiful church with simple architecture. Magnificent stained glassed windows and plenty of seating for the service. Well worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful site. Best part is climbing the steward up to the top. Very adventurous and charming. The view of the city is breathtaking.",
          "I was out in a business trip for the weekend, and had some free time on Sunday and I notice this beautiful church near the Christmas market, I looked up to see people walking outside at the very top near the steeple, and decided to go in. It cost 5 Chf to go to the roof. It was",
          "This place was just amazing to visit. The archetecture was astonishing, and the history of the place inspiring. The fact that Emperor Heinrich and his wife Kunigunde were the patrons who established the church just made it even cooler.",
          "This is one of those classic European cathedral type churches that are always nice to visit. And it us free!! Great stonework, lovely views to the back from the alter and 14th century tombs plus 23th century frescoes!!",
          "Lucky for me my sister lives in Basel. She took my wife and I into town one day to see the historic marketplatz with the beautiful old Munster church overlooking the Rhine river. We were amazed at the history of this area and it was great to be able to take the seemingly never",
          "We spent a lovely morning doing our own self-tour of Basel Munster. High on a hill you have a commanding view of the city and the Rhine. Its a good introduction to Basel and its history.",
          "Behind the church is a spectacular view of the city across the Rhine river. Church is now a Protestant one, no longer Catholic. In December there is a Christmas Market by the church.",
          "A bit of a climb, but well worth the effort. Beyond the historic value of this church, the view from the top is spectacular!",
          "We were visiting the Christmas market in the platz outside the Munster. Inside it is rather dark and lacking in the great monuments or amazing stained glass that characterise other European cathedrals. There is, however, an amazing organ which I regret I did not hear being",
          "In December with a Christmas market in the grounds and lit up by all the twinkling lights this cathedral looks quite dramatic. It's set in a lovely location overlooking the Rhine. Inside is quite underwhelming, it's quite a plain large church, not particularly ornate but a calm",
          "Beautiful cathedral with gothic style and design. Amazing view over the whole town and region from the towers.",
          "Definitely worth exploring even in the summer - lots of infesting buildings such as the Rathaus (Town Hall). Beautiful views of the Rhine. Comes alive with the Christmas markets - well organised and so pretty with all the trees lit up !",
          "Xmas market outside makes for a great atmosphere. Lovely walk above the Rhine to get to it from the bridge via the Rathaus.",
          "Amazing architecture & stunning views. Don't miss the short walk to this beautiful church. There was a winter festival happening while we were there, and we went back several times.",
          "It looks nice from the outside.. from inside its not that big.. the entrance was free.. they had a really nice christmas tree outside",
          "I was on a walking tour of Basel and this was one of the stops. The building is fascinating as all these 1200 cathedrals are plus this one has some great stories like why the sandstone are different colors, the dragon under Plexiglas in the cathedral, the secret room full of",
          "While on holiday we (my girlfriend and I) wandered to the Munster on multiple occasions; firstly to see the magnificent structure that adorned the Basel skyline, and then later to join in the opening of the Christmas market. What a beautiful place!! As well as the fantastic",
          "This beautiful church, once a Catholic cathedral but now a Protestant church, was built between 1000 and 1500 in Romanesque and Gothic styles. We spent quite a bit of time in this remarkable church and its cloister, which overlooks the Rhine River. Photographs are permitted.",
          "I love the roof of the church. The different colors are just amazing. We didn't get to go inside so I can't say much more.",
          "Walked up here as part of my solo exploration of Basel. Was lucky enough to come just as the Christmas Market had opened. Especially good were the views up and down the Rhine - what a great spot.",
          "Whilst in Basel we visited the beautiful Basel Cathedral and were glad we did Terrific architecture and some stunning views Sadly we didn\u2019t have enough time to climb the tower Worth a visit",
          "For a few Sfr you can climb the towers and get rewarded with great views of the piazza, the river, and old Basel. You have to be reasonable fit to climb either of the two towers to the top. The stairs get very narrow the higher up you climb; so make sure to listen if someone is",
          "I visited the cathedral on Monday 13 November 2017. We visited late in the afternoon, so didn't get the opportunity to look inside. However, the former episcopal church, built between the 11th and 15th centuries in Romantic and Gothic styles is worth a look. The piazza had been",
          "Worth popping in if you are in the area. I would class it as pleasant but not exceptional - some nice stained glass windows. Great scenic views down to the river. When we were there, the immediate vicinity was not enhanced by a temporary fair.",
          "It is nice historical place to visit with lots of history. As well the terrace behind the Munster is a must, as you have a great view of Basel from here. Take the small ferry going to the other side of the river which is just under the terrace",
          "I recommend to go on the top of the M\u00fcnster to see Basel in a better way. Stairs are steep ans narrow and maybe not confortable for old people.",
          "If you plan a trip in Switzerland, you have to visit Basel and it\u2019s cathedrale. Located in german part of the country, you can discover a very original town characterized by a gothique architecture. Take narrow medieval streets and join the cathedral to contemplate this",
          "Very nice view of the river.walking around that place is very nice!The area has some restaurants and coffees but make sure for the working hours",
          "I found this munster just amazing, with it's gothic atmosphere and lovely windows situated in a quiet area of Basel. A must visit.",
          "well, a typical European Cathedral. its swiss, so very clean and organised. has nice lawns around it. colourful interior and nice exterior. u can walk down here easily and enjoy the sight.",
          "Very nice cathedral. Slightly ruined by the gypsy fun fair next door. Nice views of the river. The only thing to do in Basel if you don\u2019t like art and basel aren\u2019t playing",
          "Well worth a visit to this cathedral. Stunning acoustics and beautiful internally and one of the nicest buildings in Basel.",
          "The Cathedral is an appealing part of the city skyline but when we visited it was being set up as s venue for an art display so we didn\u2019t stay long.",
          "We first approached the Minster from the side and were attracted to the cloisers by a musician busking. This was a lovely area, with nice views over the river and a quiet space to wander around. We then proceeded to the main church with a delightful aspect overlooking the main",
          "We made a short visit on a walking tour and found the burial place of Erasmus here and a portrait of him by Holbein the younger. Very interesting building with two towers that can be climbed for a fee of 5 francs according to our guide. The inside has a plate with a dragon on",
          "went around Basel on a Sunda morning and I found myself alone walking down the streets! just followed the roads and found myself in this beautiful cathedral :) the doors and walls were amazing! i didnt know that you can go inside and climb up the towers, so i failed to do that",
          "We visited on Easter weekend and the Easter decorations in the old section surrounding Basel Munster were beautiful. The wisteria was in bloom and was really gorgeous. Below Basel Munster is the people ferry. We enjoyed a ride across after going the church at Clara platz.",
          "This church is beautiful and so interesting. make sure you take a look downstairs! medieval, not gothic.",
          "The munster is beautiful from to see, that\u2019s for sure, but the real highlight is the possibility to climb all the way up to the end of the castle. Don\u2019t miss it.",
          "This is a must see in Basel and the plaza out back is not to be missed. I loved the setting in the ancient yet lived in square.",
          "Vera interesting and charming city with quiet places and lovely streets. Kind people and very good brasseries",
          "Make sure you go right to the top for an amazing/epic view over Basel you will also get a 360 degree view",
          "Beautiful spot. The church offers a quiet prayer time Monday to Friday during lunch. The church is reformed Swiss church. Much planer than usually in Europe.",
          "We enjoyed visiting this church. The amazing thing is they let you climb up the towers. We did it and the views were amazing. Not for anyone who has fear of heights! The inside of the church is very beautiful.",
          "Begun in the 12th century, the Basel Munster is situated on a bluff overlooking the Rhine River. We enjoyed its exterior and interior architecture and views of the river from its grounds.",
          "Not the biggest or grandest Cathedral we're visited but can't be missed! Interesting Gothic structure",
          "Set in a lovely area of town. Easy to walk to. Stunning inside and out from every angle and take a walk across the river to get a different view.",
          "stunning, with view over the river . Lovely place to have lunch and reflect the world as it goes by. Watch out for school trips. Can be noisy and chaotic",
          "Stunning architecture and amazing views of the Rhine into Germany. Stained glass windows are breathtakingly beautiful. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Try to go there during one of the organ recitals. Also try to visit the crypt; we could not, and try to visit a tower- we could not.",
          "This is one of the most important sites in Basel. It is easy to spot and hugs the river. Don't miss the garden area alongside the sanctuary. Some very fine modern sculptures in that area.",
          "Beautiful old Church, most popular probably for the magnificent views you get from the rear courtyard. Lovely stonework inside, some amazingly old inscripted crypts, gorgeous stained glass windows, still in use today.",
          "When in the Basel area, a visit to this town square containing this church is recommended. Very neat outside decor.",
          "The place to go to view Klein Basel from above. It is also very historic and an interesting place to visit",
          "The Basel Munster is the city cathedral. Built of red sandstone, it is a marvel that must be seen to be appreciated. Admission is free.",
          "Really impressive church with a nice atmosphere inside. You have a great view from the two towers towards Kleinbasel and over the Rhine.",
          "The cathedral is okay but it's definitely worth paying 5CHF to go up the tower. The views are great and it's a long way up! The tower closes at 4pm",
          "Only visited to escape the rain and get directions for the Hop on Hop off bus. (After visiting various cities in Europe you no longer 'wonder' at the next church/cathedral /minster. Staff were accommodating.",
          "From outside the church you can see a very interesting architecture that dates back to some hundreds of years. The church is well preserved and in December I even see reworks being done to make sure it keeps its architecture preserved. A must visit in Basel",
          "A lovely cathedral situated in Basel's Munsterplatz. A beautiful structure from the out side and equally lovely from the inside. We spent a good time in the cathedral and the outside walking around and admiring the huge structure. The Platz is full of beautiful old trees that",
          "I always enjoy taking my friends to the M\u00fcnster in Basel, because it is such a beautiful historical monument, shows the evolution of the architectural style in Basel especially Gothic and Baroque. You have access to a tower from where you have a view onto all of Basel. But you",
          "I loved the VIEW! The entrance to the Church is free, but to go upstairs - long way - be ready- will cost you 5 swiss franks. I would recommend to spend this money and take the opportunity to see he whole city of Basel. As well you could have a look at the very old part of the",
          "This definitely is a must visit in Basel. Whilst the cathedral is free, it is 5 CHF to climb to the top of the spires. However, you must be in a pair, so lone travellers may have to partner up. As the walkways, stairways and balconies at the top are incredibly narrow, this isn't",
          "Basel Munster is a beautiful place to visit when in Basel, offering a nice view of the Rhine and Klein Basel. To get there, you walk through the old town which is such a pleasure.",
          "Spent an hour sitting at the tops with my kids. Has some cool black food sculptures that were pretty interesting. Not your usual Munster but still nice to walk through (to get to the views).",
          "Interesting to see but it is a bit underwhelming if you've seen a lot of impressive European churches. Come here for the history and not necessarily for a visual feast.",
          "The history of this place and the condition it's in are both impressive. If you want, head to the top and have a view of the city. Be sure to look at the gargoyle's and the various adornments - quite interesting. In other words, always look up :) you'll always miss something",
          "The M\u00fcnster is a dominating feature on the landscape, and despite its relatively bland interior, features a couple of exquisite contemporary marble sculptures. For CHF5, you can climb up to the spires to enjoy an awe-inspiring view over Basel and presumably contribute to the",
          "Nice cathedral & the courtyard has great views over the Rhine, good central location in the old town - very nice...",
          "Just as we went upstream the course of river Rhine from the site of Rathaus,that is, to the southeast, before long we came in the Platz, on which is situated very beautiful Munster Church. It is considered together with the Mittlere Brucke(The Middle Bridge), as the most famous",
          "If you're visiting Basel then you have to visit the Munster. There are great views of Basel and the river, plus it's an amazing building with incredible stone work and fantastic interior. If you have time, it's definitely worth going up the tower itself - it does cost a few",
          "Great architecture and the most scenic river and city views. The history in the church is truly amazing. If your timing is right try to catch an organ recital.",
          "A standard church visit, very nice architecture but only worth a few minutes of visiting time. Easily accessible.",
          "We were too late to see inside. Very disappointed but took some pics of the beautiful outside. The building is quite large so go around to all sides.",
          "We enjoyed visiting the cathedral. Really pretty fassade, looking really good. It's definitely worth visiting",
          "This is up a little slope and from its grounds you get a slightly elevated view of the area. It is a peaceful break from, the shops and cafes. In my opinion it is not as stunning as St Stephen's in Vienna, the Cathedral of our Lady in Antwerp or Sagrada Familai in Barcelona, but",
          "The M\u00fcnster is kind of the icon of the city, always present on the Rhine skyline. If you have a chance go up one of the towers to get a scenic view of the so called Rhine-knee, the meandering part of the Rhine.",
          "Church has an interesting history and it's worth taking time to wander around the grounds. Initially we went inside and took in the stain glass windows, the altar and marveled at the structure. At the last minute,we walked over to the side into a courtyard and then behind the",
          "This beautifully kept architectural statement is so beautiful and the artwork on the buildings and walls is wonderful to see. You can spend a few minutes or a longer time here, but not to be missed if you are in the area. Awesome spot to see, whether you are a local or a",
          "This red rock church is beautiful. The facade is awesome. Note the man courting the girl and then walk to see his snakes behind. The doorways have whisper ways so one can talk to another without appearing to do so. The interior is regal.",
          "Foremost among churches in Basel is this cathedral, a wonderful example of gothic architecture. Loved the colorful roof tiles. Attended church services there since I was there on a Sunday morning, although it was conducted in German. The organ music was particularly wonderful.",
          "we went to the old city for a walk and found a beautiful experience. the architecture and the places along the walk for a drink. Crossing the Rhine in the current driven boat/Ferry was a nice experience and then walking on the river front watching the locals swim the river made",
          "We have been to a lot church and cathedral. It is a nice place but the nicest part was to climb to the top. For \u20ac5 each, you can climb to the top. The staircase is extremely narrow but it has a rope by the wall so you can use it to assist the climb. It reminded us of climbing to",
          "Nice walk up to the Munster. They did some renovation, so the entrance was not easy to find. Could climb up the two towers and enjoy the great view over Basel and the river Rhine. After walked down the steps to the river and crossed with a small ferry to the other side.",
          "It is a monumental piece of architecture on a hill. Do not miss Kreuzgang! I assume there are tombs of some important people beneath the granite floor. Both views - from the hill, where the Munster is located and from the other side of Rhine on the Munster are cool!",
          "The Munster, on the river banks, is indeed a stunning example of Goth architecture, with its wall carvings, windows, domes and stained glass! You can walk through the columned hallways and up to some levels as well. Enjoy the view from the courtyard and square looking out to the",
          "Stroll around the old city. Admire the cathedral, its inner architecture and its exterior outline, the reddish colour of the stone.",
          "This is a large, attractive cathedral with a relatively bare interior (much was stripped away when changed from Catholic to Protestant). You can still see some of the painted walls and the artwork is gorgeous. Climbing the towers is possible and gives and incredible view. Note",
          "Any visit to Basel must include a trip to the Munster. It's a very special place. If you're fit enough do the trip up the towers - heads for heights are needed though. Views are stunning and worth the strain. Lovely view of the city from behind the Munster at ground level",
          "This square has amazing energy, it's really peaceful and calming. The church is beautiful and you can visit inside, outside and some open galleries. All really really nice. There's a surprise view over the river if you walk to the gardens out back. Restaurant and transportation",
          "Wow - we stumbled in while a guy was lighting up the pipes. The sound was fantastic - try to find out when they play and drop in - no charge.",
          "Very nice church that is also the resting place for Erasmus. A pity that all the highlights are not in english so as a tourist, I can only appreciate the art and the structure without knowing the meaning behind it. Recommended to do some homework before going.",
          "We attended the a church service at the Basel Munster. The organ music and choir were excellent and our visit was very memorable.",
          "Basel is definitely worth a visit with a nice city centre where authentic old buildings and churches mix with modern fashion shops. Two tips: Visit the bar rouge for a magnificent view on the town and surroundins. Second one; buy an unique swim bag and take a swim in the river",
          "Walking up the hill on narrow cobble stone streets until you reach the open plaza before the church gives you a magnificent view of this beautiful church built in 1200's.The cloister to the right of the entrance shelters the crypts of bishops and rulers of the the past",
          "This place has nice memories associated with it. I used to come here with family. I particularly like coming here on work days when it is all very quiet. Another nice thing to do here is to climb up the tower and get a good view around. It can be done when there is someone to go",
          "When we visited this church, we were not able to see all of it as some part was under restoration. However, unique thing about this church is it's roof with colorful tiles.",
          "My wife and I visited the church today and had a great view of the whole city from the church tower. Highly recommended. It costs 5 Swiss Franc per person. You cannot go up alone and has to be accompanied by someone. Good rule to prevent the sad ones doing stupid things.",
          "The best part is climbing it up via its small stairs and dark passages! Minimum of two people everytime, 1-2 euros, do ti!",
          "It was pure serendipity that led us to the Munster at about 15:30 on Saturday. We entered to enjoy the beauty of the church, and stayed to enjoy both the organist practicing (and playing a Bach toccata), as well as a practice of the Boys' Choir, which was outstanding. We",
          "Nice view of the river and city and beautiful church! Was great to enjoy on a summer's day! The inner yard of the church is really pleasant and the view to the river is the best in town. Usually there are many people visiting or taking breaks (like scholars), but during working",
          "Beatiful and easy location . The construction is amazing and take only half a hour to visit . it is one of the nice spots in that so lovely city .",
          "The Munster is a beautiful cathedral, outside and inside. In other cathedrals you are always looking up at the stained glass windows but this Munster has a mezzanine floor that puts you at the same level as some of the windows. It was a great opportunity to examine the",
          "I reviewed the entire cathedral and grounds in another review of Muensterplatz. The entire area is the experience, but the cathedral gives a wonderful respite among the ancient things.",
          "While this looks great from the outside as I tried to enter there was a sign to say sightseeing not welcome. So that was that.",
          "The cathedral and a climb up its tower is a must do in Basel. From its top, it offers a panoramic view of Rhine and Basel. On a clear day, it is a photographer's delight. A deep shot of the street below from the top with f/22 can give the viewer a sense of its height. Tickets",
          "You cannot go to Basel and not go here! The building is beautiful and the inside doesn't disappoint. You must pay the extra 5 francs to go up to the top of the tower! The views are amazing! You could spend a good hour, hour 1/2 there touring the whole place.",
          "Not for the faint-hearted or people who don't like close spaces, the climb up to the towers is via extremely narrow spiral staircases. Once you get to the top, however, the views are spectacular: you can see the Vosges in France and the Black Forest in Germany.",
          "Awestruck by size of ancient craftsmanship. There is some renovation but it is a must see in Basel. View the North side and walk around to the Rhine.",
          "Went here. Very nice overlooks river. Photos permitted. No fees. Bathroom across street. Saw people up higher. Don't know how to get up there.",
          "This is not the most outstanding gothic cathedral of the region but the exceptionally beautiful surroundings with a view on the river Rhine make it a very attractive place to visit. The surrounding old quarter of Basel is very beautiful too.",
          "We visited the cathedral incidentally at the end of a concert. Unfortunately we did not enjoy but 5 minutes of the concert. There is a schedule besides one of the doors of the cathedral so take a look, maybe something interests you. Other than that, this is a typical gothic",
          "This minster has beautiful architecture and is in quiet area! I would definitely recommend going to visit this!",
          "A fine example of a cathedral the Munster has an unparalleled view of the Rhine from the plaza in the rear. The adjoining cloister to the right is worth a visit and a climb up the tower gives way to a birds-eye 360 degree view of the entire city. Not for those with a fear of",
          "We visited this cathedral as part of a walking tour. The guide pointed out some interesting historical facts which definitely added to the visit.",
          "The red sandstone sets this one apart from other castles for me. Beginning in 1019 and continuing for ~500 years, the land where this cathedral is built has been used since the Celtic eras, destroyed and rebuilt several times. Very striking and the central part of Basel. We were",
          "Beautiful cathedral, wonderful architecture and coloured roof tile. Peaceful and worth a visit. One of the top attractions at Basel.",
          "There on Sunday and apparently not open during the afternoon. So all the comments about the peaceful interior were for naught. Lots of people looking to get in so I did not get the wrong door. Great from the outside. Note Jewish star on side window.",
          "This cathedral is beautiful and impressive. It is in the center of the old town and worth a look. The setting on the main square is the perfect setting and the buildings around it only make it more impressive.",
          "Quite impressive when you walk up from the Munsterberg. Apart from the main gate, the noticeable elements are a St Vincent bas-relief dated 1095 AD near Erasmus epitaph (left side inside) and the Sint-Gallen gate (outside), when walking left from the main gate, followed by the",
          "If you can plan your trip to attend a service or concert the acoustics are phenomenal. On a quaint quiet square.",
          "It's a very pretty town. The cathedral is fantastic. The color of the church is really impressive. But not only, also around it. It is on a a very pretty square. After visiting the cathedral, you must try the boat to cross the river which is very interesting and also a must.",
          "The Munster itself is situated on the hilltop overseeing the Rhine river. A gorgeous place to visit and to walk around",
          "It's a fabulous experience just to stand outside and take it in - and wander around the square in the spacious setting on the Rhine river. Munster is really what the wonderful city of Basel is all about. History in a modern setting with resonance of centuries.",
          "An attractive gothic church. Impressive inside with nice cloisters. Ask for the archaeology key at the entrance visitor desk though, and you get to see the remaining parts of the earlier carolingian church with some pre-Roman and late Roman remains.",
          "There is some obvious competitiveness among the cities and villages to have beautiful churches, and this one does not even vaguely disappoint. Beautiful, elegant, with very detailed history",
          "This place is amazing from the red stone exterior to the beautiful stained glass windows on the inside. This is one of the most beautiful churches I've been to in Europe and the opportunity to climb the tower(s) is the highlight! Some things to keep in mind: 1) the climb in the",
          "We appreciated the history and the architecture of this beautiful cathedral. The cloisters lead out to a quiet, peaceful area with great views of the river an the city. We were told that the platz in front of the church, while very quiet on the spring weekday we were there, is",
          "The absolute best view of the Rhine and Basel! Incredible ! Stunning ! If there is one thing you must see is the view from this spot! Does not matter what the weather is ....... the view is great!",
          "The cathedral has some impressive stained glass. You have to exit the cathedral to get to the cloister that overlooks the Rhine and one of the antique drift ferries that crosses it.",
          "We visited this on a city tour of Basel with Viking River Cruise. Unique church with a mixture of Gothic and Romanesque features. Constructed of red sandstone that is abundant in the area. No cost to enter. If you are in the Basel area, it would be a good place to visit",
          "By far the highlight of Basel. In truth there is not a huge amount to see in the city but this M\u00fcnster and the surrounding square are lovely. Well worth going up the tower for the lovely views. Cost \u20ac18 for 3 adults and one student. Overall, Basel is not worth much more than",
          "Like most tall churches in Switzerland, the Basle M\u00fcnster is worth visiting even if it is just for the view you'll enjoy from the top of its bell tower. To get to see it you'll have to climb up a rather marvellously dark and precarious ancient staircase, which is not to be",
          "This a a must see in Basel. Not only the church is fantastic, at thr Pfalz you will enjoy fantastic views to,Basel",
          "Great Olde Town and square, church, well maintained, close to the Rhine, within 10 minutes of Hotel D and the tram.",
          "Its so high that you can see the whole city. Very nice views and highly recommended to go on top. You can view the beautiful lake which is on the back of the munster. A must see.",
          "Amazing place. At our visit they held an art exibition inside a silent yard next to the church itself. Behind is an observation area with amazing view over city and Rhine. You can see a small model of M\u00fcnster there as well. You can buy drinks at one if the historic",
          "Every European town has their fantastic scenic gothic cathedral and munster is Basels. This is well worth checking out as the building itself is a scene to behold in its beauty, particularly when you marbel that it was built hundreds of years ago long before any modern equipmwnt",
          "Basel is a quaint, lively, colourful city. Munster is a beautiful church building with huge towers seen from a far distance, gleaming in sunshine with its beauty. 5 Euros entry fee to go up the tower was absolutely worth every penny spent. Narrow stairs in this quaint building",
          "In terms of European cathedrals, it is neither the largest, most ornate nor is it truly grand. But it left an impression on me on a hot March, spring day. Inside it was truly serene, in stark contrast to the hordes of tourists gaggling outside. Unlike Protestant cathedrals that",
          "This Cathedral at this Munster can be viewed across the river while traveling in the tram and is very inviting. The whole area in very historic and peaceful with a gorgeous surrounding. Spent close to an hour walking around the place and visiting the cathedral.",
          "Great historic architecture in the heart of Basel. Overlooking the river and the ferry. Also the M\u00fcnsterplatz is great also.",
          "quick one hour in the evening. loved the intricate with and the architecture. loved the view of the city and the river from the balcony. too pricey to climb up to the top so skipped it.",
          "Lovely Cathedral, with lovely views on the outside. Especially the Rheinfahre. On a clear day you could see both borders Germany on one side and France on the other.",
          "You could see it from all over Basel. It was beautiful. Unfortunately it was closed when I went so I couldn't see the inside.",
          "I was very impressed with the building and the surrounding area. It it well worth to climb up to the top to see a fantastic view (there are few viewing terraces on different levels). Inside the cathedral there is a grave of Erasmus of Rotterdam.",
          "I love this area of Basel! The Munster is set near the water and has great views. The building itself is lovely and well worth a visit. There is a large square that is great to walk around in during warm weather and in the autumn is filled with rides for Herbstmesse. Well worth",
          "Loose yourself in watching the details of this masterpiece of early craftsmanship. Climb the tower as well to gain a wonderful view over Basel. Have a rest on the terrace and watch the Rhine flow by...",
          "Interesting sandstone building with twin towers set in a large picturesque square. The Munster has great stained glass windows and some very nice carvings. It\u2019s a great place (both inside and out) for photography.",
          "This church is made of red sandstone, and has some interesting carvings at the back, especially the 2 elephants. The 2 portals have nice sculptures, and are very well worth seeing. You will see more details with a zoom or binocular. The main portals has large statues. Inside the",
          "Currently undergoing some renovation work but definitely worth a visit. The views are brilliant across the river Rhine and the streets around this area are well worth seeing too.",
          "Set in a beautiful square, this cathedral is well worth a visit. Lots to see including the tomb of Erasmus. Would love to come back again when they have the Xmas market in the square.",
          "I'm not a fan of churches but we were impressed with the outside decoration of the Munster so ventured in. A very impressive place with the most stunning, vibrant and detailed stained glass I have ever seen. Well worth a visit and it's free.",
          "Great to visit especially for the view from one of the towers (5,- p.p.) although the climb up can be a bit challenging (spiral staircase and wooden stairs). Be careful: you will walk near the bells so esp. at the hour could be very noisy. The church itself is nice, although",
          "Climbing the tower at this lovely church is fun and provides excellent views of the city. It's five francs for access to the tower and well worth it!",
          "It was a walk with a friend from Portugal from Kunstmuseum to M\u00fcnsterplatz and then Pfalz. This walk is definitely something that all visitors of Basel should do. From Pfalz you get the best overview over the river and the city.",
          "A real experience looking around at the stain glass windows, great view from the top of the tower, free to walk around and sit for a while, very relaxing and can take pictures too.",
          "Beautiful area awesome to visit, the most impressive is how huge all of the doorways are. Inside it is not huge but it is beautiful and ornate.",
          "What a beautiful old church right on the banks of the Rhine. Could not have found a better spot to start exploring the old town.",
          "In the middle of Basel, with a special terrace overlooking Rhine with special views. An impressive Gothic cathedral and a charnful square.",
          "The church itself is lovely. It has different tombs in it. The stained glass windows are beautiful.and well worth a visit. We did go up to the tower and got as far as this gigantic bell. One needs to be fit and thin to get to the top as the stairs are very narrow! When we got to",
          "Amazing cathedral in the heart of Basel. The highlight is being able to go up the two towers. Get ready for lots of spiral stairs, but it is more than worth it! It's incredible to see the interior of the bell mechanism, as well as the beams and construction of the towers. You",
          "Basel Munster is an active worshipping community, encompassing the usual challenges of an ancient building in a postmodern secular era. There was much to love about this building, its location, and its layout. But somehow the visit left me somewhat unsatisfied. It's hard to put",
          "Great place, super to hang out above the Rhine in the park behind the church. Very nice architecture and a peaceful place.",
          "The Basler M\u00fcnster is placed in the center of town. A beautiful experience is awaiting you, bringing you back in time. A great plus is the view at the back of the Basler M\u00fcnster on the river Rhein and the town.",
          "The munster is really nice and it is not only for those who likes \"churches\". There you will find art, nice statues, nice view of the river and more. It really worth it. And as it is close to everything so you can easily walk around.",
          "Fantastic inside and out. It was very busy and a service was about o begin but the staff were very friendly and accommodating.",
          "M\u00fcnster cathedral, the best: impressive view of the river and the city, St. Gallen entrance, Erasmus sepulchre,, statues.",
          "A must see place if you are visiting Basel. Look at the roof and spend some time during xmas as they decorate it in and out and around it!",
          "We climbed up the bell tower, you get fantastic views from the various levels, which were well worth the effort. The spiral staircase is quite steep and narrow.",
          "We started our amazing voyage up the Rhine in Basel and had a guided tour of the city. The highlight of the tour was viewing this lovely cathedral. The architecture of this red sandstone cathedral is a sight to see and quite picturesque. The cathedral was originally Catholic but",
          "It was worth the payment and going up the narrow stairs. The top area can be a little frightening to people who are scared of heights but it is not dangerous. Some areas need some patience because only one person can walk through some narrow and small stairs so people wait to go",
          "Basel is picture perfect. All of the old town buildings are expertly restored and beautifully maintained. A mammoth task. This is no exception. The stained glass is breathtaking. The architecture stunning. The tombs are incredible especially, for global scholars, Erasmus's",
          "A must see on your visit to Basel. Lovely to walk through and the view of the Rhine from the back of the Cathedral should not be missed. There is a large open square at the front, very picturesque and just lovely to spend time and explore.",
          "The cathedral itself is lovely, but the wide open space next to it is my favorite part of Basel. The buildings surrounding the square {Munsterplatz} are uniformally delightful and you have access to some of the best views over the Rhine. Throughout the year the square plays host",
          "If you are wandering around Basel this is one place to visit. Go out back and check out the view of the river. As far as cathedrals go not overly impressive.",
          "I was in Basel for a few days, and the city's landmark must be this Cathedral. This former Episcopal Church was built between the 12th & the 15th century in romanesque & gothic style. It is open to visitors, & the main part of the cathedral is free to wander about in. There is",
          "A must see. Impressive, imposing structure with a commanding view of the river. I thought it quite interesting and we visited on an awful cold and rainy day! Can't imagine how lovely it must be in the better months!",
          "Really free nice to visit church and spectacular view from the tower! ( entrace free just for the tower) If you like to climb up the towers, well this is an experience!",
          "The only downside is that it is not open at any time, so be mindful of the opening times. Also as with any lookout point, better weather makes it more enjoyable. Otherwise must see in Basel.",
          "I visited the cathedral on the occasion of the Christmas market, I was excited, it's a beautiful building, inside and outside, spiritual place, only regret that I did not succeed to climb the observation tower of the cathedral.",
          "cathedral was simple and magnificent at the same time. The chairs inside were all hand carved but there was no figurines as you would find in others in this style. Well kept after and beautiful.",
          "A beautiful ancient cathedral. I love all of the stained glass windows and the amazing architecture. I'm in awe as to how they constructed such a building so long ago. Worth a view.",
          "This building is worth a visit, the inside is not a big as it looks from far away, but beautiful inside, so worth a visit. There are some guidebooks for sale inside if you wish for more informstion.",
          "The building is nice and beautiful. Unfortunately, we couldnt go in as the church was closed on a xmas eve day. Nonetheless, behind the church is a view of basel's river and we could see the river boat and buildings opposite the river.",
          "The Basel Cathedral is stunning with its details and red bricks. We had the fortune of passing it in the evening where it was covered in light and cornered with the Christmas market. The cathedral fit well into the surrounds and it is well worth to walk around in the",
          "Lovely Cathedral in Basel city, with lovely architecture. Added bonus that the Christmas markets were right next to it. Didn't have time to go in - but lovely all the same.",
          "Popped in..church itself is really pretty. Decided to head up the tower. Paid 5chf per adult (discounts available for students) It's a long way up and very claustrophobic but great view of Rhine.. would recommend \ud83d\ude00",
          "A beautiful cathedral that lies high up looking down on the river Rhine. Built around 800 a.Chr. Originally there were 5 Towers, after the Major Earthquake of 1356 However, only 2 were re-built. Heigth of Towers 65 + 62 m.",
          "Beautiful cathedral with a great view of the river and city. Nice inner courtyard with great character.",
          "It was interesting architecture both inside and outside (rooftile has unique pattern). I think to climb the tower you need to buy ticket",
          "The Munster at Christmas has a Christmas market outside and the ferry across the river just below. The outside is stunning but at Christmas we were disappointed to see very little in the way of nativity decoration or celebration.",
          "If you are into history this is a good place to go. It gives you a better understanding of what formed the modern Basel. The views of the Rhine from the courtyard are breathtaking but pay the 2 Euros and climb to the top of the south spire. You will not be disappointed.",
          "I visited the place twice: in the evening to enjoy the view and the lights from the terrace overlooking the river and in the morning to visit the monument. I liked the exterior best, the inside is quite simple but well kept",
          "During a short visit to Basel we visited the Christmas market in the old town. Although somewhat cold weather it was a nice experience and some drops of the local christmas brew was making the evening very good!",
          "Basel Munster is at the heart of Munsterplatz also home of the smaller Basel Christmas market. The church building has some great architecture with a life size knight defeating a dragon. The interior is just as impressive. Basel Munster is located around. 7 min stroll from the",
          "Nice Munster, small but interesting. Free. For 1 Swiss Franc you can climb the tower.....go for it.....It is brilliant. More from the Alice in Wonderland-like stairs getting more narrow and tight the further up you go. There is a very, very narrow walkway around tower about",
          "Stepped in for a visit. They had an exhibit of rare books. Wish I could read Swiss but hey. Only detraction was a harvest fair just outside with a lot of noise from the rides so we didn't get the peaceful experience others encountered. Still worth a visit. Great vistas of the",
          "Overlooking the River Rhine, this stunning piece of architecture is a must see when visiting Basel. We were in Basel for the Christmas Markets one of which is in the adjacent square and made for some great selfie backdrops. My only regret was not getting to spend more time",
          "The lofty interior provides a wonderful contrast to the bustle, light and crowds of the Christmas market alongside. It seems very austere but the red sandstone and warm temperature make for a calming atmosphere and make a welcome break from the low outside temperature.",
          "We enjoyed two different tours of the Munster, discovering different things each time! I expecially loved the garden courtyard surrounded by archways, and also all the family crests on the wall. If you know a little latin you can try to decode them, and unlock further histories",
          "We were fortunate to visit while an exhibit of the humanist Erasmus and his translations of parts of the Bible were on display. It was a fascinating exhibit depicting the tension developing in Europe between different religious factions. Outside in the square were rides and food",
          "This church is probably one of the best attractions in Basel. I recommend all the visitors to go there and check it. The view on the back is really cool, you see a big part of Basel and the Rhin.",
          "Our most recent visit was as the Christmas Market was being organized but not fully ready for guests.. there were food stands and the setting is perfect for such a market. We enjoyed being there in spite of the chilly wind.",
          "This cathedral is made of red sandstone and colourful roof tiles which is both striking and beautiful as the architecture and colour makes it stand out from the surrounding buildings. Behind the cathedral is a nice view of the Rhine River, bridge and buildings on the opposite",
          "Located in the very heart of this small and attractive Swiss city, the Church is very well maintained and certainly worth a visit, even if a short one",
          "Great views of the Rhine and Christmas time the area has a Christmas market, not the biggest of cathedrals"

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany. As of 2016, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018). The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007.

Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020.

In the federal election, a total of 57,304 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 50.4%.\n\n\n==== Council of States ====\nOn 20 October 2019, in the federal election Eva Herzog, member of the Social Democratic Party      (SP), was elected for the first time as a State Councillor (St\u00e4nder\u00e4tin) in the first round as single representative of the canton of Basel-Town and successor of Anita Fetz in the national Council of States (St\u00e4nderat) with an absolute majority of 37'210 votes.On 18 October 2015, in the federal election State Councillor (German: St\u00e4nder\u00e4tin) Anita Fetz, member of the Social Democratic Party       (SP), was re-elected in the first round as single representative of the canton of Basel-Town in the national Council of States (St\u00e4nderat) with an absolute majority of 35'842 votes. She has been a member of it since 2003.\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\n\n==== Twin towns and sister cities ====\nBasel has two sister cities and a twinning among two states:\n Shanghai, China, since 2007\n US State Massachusetts, since 2002\n Miami Beach, US, since 2011\n\n\n==== Partner cities ====\n Rotterdam, Netherlands, since 1945\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nBasel has a population (as of August 2019) of 177,654.  As of 2015, 35.5% of the population are resident foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years (1999\u20132009 ) the population has changed at a rate of \u22120.3%. It has changed at a rate of 3.2% due to migration and at a rate of \u22123% due to births and deaths.Of the population in the municipality 58,560 or about 35.2% were born in Basel and lived there in 2000.

In this case, a room is defined as space of a housing unit of at least 4 m2 (43 sq ft) as normal bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens and habitable cellars and attics. About 10.5% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement).\nAs of 2000, there were 86,371 private households in the municipality, and an average of 1.8 persons per household. There were 44,469 households that consist of only one person and 2,842 households with five or more people.

The vacancy rate for the municipality, in 2010, was 0.74%.\n\n\n==== Historical population ====\n\n\n=== Language ===\nMost of the population (as of 2000) speaks German (129,592 or 77.8%), with Italian being second most common (9,049 or 5.4%) and French being third (4,280 or 2.6%). There are 202 persons who speak Romansh.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nFrom the 2000 census, 41,916 or 25.2% were Roman Catholic, while 39,180 or 23.5% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. Of the rest of the population, there were 4,567 members of an Orthodox church (or about 2.74% of the population), there were 459 individuals (or about 0.28% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 3,464 individuals (or about 2.08% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church.

There were 1,325 individuals (or about 0.80% of the population) who were Jewish, however only members of religious institutions are counted as such by the municipality, which makes the actual number of people of Jewish descent living in Basel considerably higher. There were 746 individuals who were Buddhist, 947 individuals who were Hindu and 485 individuals who belonged to another church. 52,321 (or about 31.41% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 8,780 individuals (or about 5.27% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nBasel is subdivided into 19 quarters (Quartiere). The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%. As of 2008, there were 18 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 9 businesses involved in this sector. 34,645 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,176 businesses in this sector. 120,130 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 8,908 businesses in this sector.

About 23.9% of the workforce coming into Basel are coming from outside Switzerland, while 1.0% of the locals commute out of Switzerland for work. Of the working population, 49.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 18.7% used a private car.\n\nThe Roche Tower, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, is 41 floors and 178 metres (584 ft) high, upon its opening in 2015 it has become the tallest building in Switzerland. Basel has also Switzerland's third tallest building (Basler Messeturm, 105 m (344 ft)) and Switzerland's tallest tower (St. Chrischona TV tower, 250 m (820 ft)).\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nThe Swiss chemical industry operates largely from Basel, and Basel also has a large pharmaceutical industry. Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel. Prior to the formation of Swiss International Air Lines, the regional airline Crossair was headquartered near Basel.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nBasler Zeitung (\"BaZ\") and bz Basel are the local newspapers. The local TV station is called Telebasel. The German-speaking Swiss Radio and Television SRF company, part of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR, holds offices in Basel as well. The academic publishers Birkh\u00e4user, Karger and MDPI are based in Basel.\n\n\n=== Trade fairs ===\nImportant trade shows include Art Basel, the world's most important fair for modern and contemporary art, Baselworld (watches and jewelry), Swissbau (construction and real estate) and Igeho (hotels, catering, take-away, care). The Swiss Sample Fair (\"Schweizer Mustermesse\") was the largest and oldest consumer fair in Switzerland. It was held from 2007 to 2019 and took place in Kleinbasel on the right bank of the Rhine.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBesides Humanism the city of Basel has also always been very famous for its achievement in the field of mathematics. Among others, the mathematician Leonhard Euler and the Bernoulli family have done research and been teaching at the local institutions for centuries. In 1910 the Swiss Mathematical Society was founded in the city and in the mid-twentieth century the Russian mathematician Alexander Ostrowski taught at the local university. \nIn 2000 about 57,864 or (34.7%) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 27,603 or (16.6%) have completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Of the 27,603 who completed tertiary schooling, 44.4% were Swiss men, 31.1% were Swiss women, 13.9% were non-Swiss men and 10.6% were non-Swiss women.In 2010 11,912 students attended the University of Basel (55% female). 25% were foreign nationals, 16% were from canton of Basel-Stadt. In 2006, 6162 students studied at one of the nine academies of the FHNW (51% female).As of 2000, there were 5,820 students in Basel who came from another municipality, while 1,116 residents attended schools outside the municipality.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nBasel hosts Switzerland's oldest university, the University of Basel, dating from 1460. Erasmus, Paracelsus, Daniel Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler, Jacob Burckhardt, Friedrich Nietzsche, Tadeusz Reichstein, Karl Jaspers, Carl Gustav Jung and Karl Barth worked there. The University of Basel is currently counted among the 90 best educational institutions worldwide.In 2007, the ETH (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Z\u00fcrich) established the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) in Basel. The creation of the D-BSSE was driven by a Swiss-wide research initiative SystemsX, and was jointly supported by funding from the ETH Z\u00fcrich, the Swiss Government, the Swiss University Conference (SUC) and private industry.Basel also hosts several academies of the Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz|Fachhochschule NW (FHNW): the FHNW Academy of Art and Design, FHNW Academy of Music, and the FHNW School of Business.Basel is renowned for various scientific societies, such as the Entomological Society of Basel (Entomologische Gesellschaft Basel, EGB), which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2005.\n\n\n=== Volksschule ===\nIn 2005 16,939 pupils and students visited the Volksschule (the obligatory school time, including Kindergarten (127), primary schools (Primarschule, 25), and lower secondary schools (Sekundarschule, 10), of which 94% visited public schools and 39.5% were foreign nationals. In 2010 already 51.1% of all pupils spoke another language than German as their first language. In 2009 3.1% of the pupils visited special classes for pupils with particular needs. The average amount of study in primary school in Basel is 816 teaching hours per year.\n\n\n=== Upper secondary school ===\nIn 2010 65% of the youth finished their upper secondary education with a vocational training and education, 18% finished their upper secondary education with a Federal Matura at one of the five gymnasiums, 5% completed a Fachmaturit\u00e4t at the FMS, 5% completed a Berufsmaturit\u00e4t synchronously to their vocational training, and 7% other kind of upper secondary maturity. 14.1% of all students at public gymnasiums were foreign nationals. The Maturity quota in 2010 was on a record high at 28.8% (32.8 female, 24.9% male).\n\nBasel has five public gymnasiums (Gymnasium B\u00e4umlihof, Gymnasium Kirschgarten, Gymnasium am M\u00fcnsterplatz, Gymnasium Leonhard, Wirtschaftsgymnasium und Wirtschaftsmittelschule Basel), each with its own profiles (different focus on major subjects, such as visual design, biology and chemistry, Italian, Spanish, or Latin languages, music, physics and applied mathematics, philosophy/education/psychology, and economics and law) that entitles students with a successful Matura graduation to attend universities. And one Fachmaturit\u00e4tsschule, the FMS, with six different major subjects (health/natural sciences, education, social work, design/art, music/theatre/dance, and communication/media) that entitles students with a successful Fachmatura graduation to attend Fachhochschulen. Four different h\u00f6here Fachschulen (higher vocational schools such as Bildungszentrum Gesundheit Basel-Stadt (health), Allgemeine Gewerbeschule Basel (trade), Berufsfachschule Basel, Schule f\u00fcr Gestaltung Basel (design)) allows vocational students to improve their knowledge and know-how.\n\n\n=== International schools ===\nAs a city with a percentage of foreigners of more than thirty-five percent and as one of the most important centres in the chemical and pharmaceutical field in the world, Basel counts several international schools including: Academia International School, \u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise de B\u00e2le, Freies Gymnasium Basel (private), Gymnasium am M\u00fcnsterplatz (public), Schweizerisch-italienische Primarschule Sandro Pertini, and SIS Swiss International School.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nBasel is home to at least 65 libraries. Some of the largest include; the Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Basel (main university library), the special libraries of the University of Basel, the Allgemein Bibliotheken der Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Gutes und Gemeinn\u00fctziges (GGG) Basel, the Library of the P\u00e4dagogische Hochschule, the Library of the Hochschule f\u00fcr Soziale Arbeit and the Library of the Hochschule f\u00fcr Wirtschaft.

A memorial to Erasmus lies inside the M\u00fcnster. The City Hall from the 16th century is located on the Market Square and is decorated with fine murals on the outer walls and on the walls of the inner court.\n\nBasel is also host to an array of buildings by internationally renowned architects. These include the Beyeler Foundation by Renzo Piano, or the Vitra complex in nearby Weil am Rhein, composed of buildings by architects such as Zaha Hadid (fire station), Frank Gehry (Design Museum), \u00c1lvaro Siza Vieira (factory building) and Tadao Ando (conference centre). Basel also features buildings by Mario Botta (Jean Tinguely Museum and Bank of International settlements) and Herzog & de Meuron (whose architectural practice is in Basel, and who are best known as the architects of Tate Modern in London and the Bird's Nest in Beijing, the Olympia stadium, which was designed for use throughout the 2008 Summer Olympics and Paralympics). The city received the Wakker Prize in 1996.\n\n\n==== Heritage sites ====\nBasel features a great number of heritage sites of national significance.These include the entire Old Town of Basel as well as the following buildings and collections: \n\nChurches and monasteries\nOld Catholic Prediger Kirche (church), Bischofshof with Collegiate church at Rittergasse 1, Domhof at M\u00fcnsterplatz 10\u201312, former Carthusian House of St Margarethental, Catholic Church of St Antonius, Lohnhof (former Augustinians Collegiate Church), Mission 21, Archive of the Evangelisches Missionswerk Basel, M\u00fcnster of Basle (cathedral), Reformed Elisabethenkirche (church), Reformed Johanneskirche (church), Reformed Leonhardskirche (church, former Augustinians Abbey), Reformed Martinskirche (church), Reformed Pauluskirche (church), Reformed Peterskirche (church), Reformed St. Albankirche (church) with cloister and cemetery, Reformed Theodorskirche (church), Synagoge at Eulerstrasse 2Secular buildings\n\nBadischer Bahnhof (German Baden's railway station) with fountain, Bank for International Settlements, Blaues Haus (Reichensteinerhof) at Rheinsprung 16, Bruderholzschule (school house) at Fritz-Hauser-Strasse 20, Brunschwiler Haus at Hebelstrasse 15, Bahnhof Basel SBB (Swiss railway station), B\u00fcrgerspital (hospital), Caf\u00e9 Spitz (Merianfl\u00fcgel), Coop Schweiz company's central archive, Depot of the Arch\u00e4ologischen Bodenforschung des Kanton Basel-Stadt, former Gallizian Paper Mill and Swiss Museum of Paper, former Klingental-Kaserne (casern) with Klingentaler Kirche (church), Fasnachtsbrunnen (fountain), Feuersch\u00fctzenhaus (guild house of the riflemen) at Sch\u00fctzenmattstrasse 56, Fischmarktbrunnen (fountain), Geltenzunft at Marktplatz 13, Gymnasium am Kohlenberg (St Leonhard) (school), Hauptpost (main post office), Haus zum Raben at Aeschenvorstadt 15, Hohenfirstenhof at Rittergasse 19, Holsteinerhof at Hebelstrasse 30, Markgr\u00e4flerhof a former palace of the margraves of Baden-Durlach, Mittlere Rhein Br\u00fccke (Central Rhine Bridge), Stadtcasino (music hall) at Steinenberg 14, Ramsteinerhof at Rittergasse 7 and 9, Rathaus (town hall), Rundhof building of the Schweizerischen Mustermesse, Safranzunft at Gerbergasse 11, Sandgrube at Riehenstrasse 154, Schl\u00f6sschen (Manor house) Gundeldingen, Sch\u00f6nes Haus and Sch\u00f6ner Hof at Nadelberg 6, Wasgenring school house, Seidenhof with painting of Rudolf von Habsburg, Spalenhof at Spalenberg 12, Spiesshof at Heuberg 7, city walls, Townhouse (former post office) at Stadthausgasse 13 / Toteng\u00e4sslein 6, Weisses Haus at Martinsgasse 3, Wildt'sches Haus at Petersplatz 13, Haus zum Neuen Singer at Speiserstrasse 98, Wolfgottesacker at M\u00fcnchensteinerstrasse 99, Zerkindenhof at Nadelberg 10.\n\nArchaeological sites\nThe Celtic Settlement at Gasfabrik, M\u00fcnsterh\u00fcgel and Altstadt (historical city, late La T\u00e8ne and medieval settlement).Museums, archives and collections\nBasel calls itself the Cultural Capital of Switzerland.Among others, there is the Anatomical Museum of the University Basel, Berri-Villen and Museum of Ancient Art Basel and Ludwig Collection, Former Franciscan Barefoot Order Church and Basel Historical Museum, Company Archive of Novartis, Haus zum Kirschgarten which is part of the Basel Historical Museum, \nHistoric Archive Roche and Industrial Complex Hoffmann-La Roche, \nJewish Museum of Switzerland, Caricature & Cartoon Museum Basel, Karl Barth-Archive, Kleines Klingental (Lower Klingen Valley) with Museum Klingental, \nArt Museum of Basel, hosting the world's oldest art collection accessible to the public, \nNatural History Museum of Basel and the Museum of Cultures Basel, Museum of Modern Art Basel with the E.

Theater Basel, chosen in 1999 as the best stage for German-language performances and in 2009 and 2010 as \"Opera house of the year\" by German opera magazine Opernwelt, presents a busy schedule of plays in addition to being home to the city's opera and ballet companies. Basel is home to the largest orchestra in Switzerland, the Sinfonieorchester Basel. It is also the home of the Basel Sinfonietta and the Kammerorchester Basel, which recorded the complete symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven for the Sony label, led by its music director Giovanni Antonini. The Schola Cantorum and the Basler Kammerorchester were both founded by the conductor Paul Sacher, who went on to commission works by many leading composers. The Paul Sacher Foundation, opened in 1986, houses a major collection of manuscripts, including the entire Igor Stravinsky archive.\nThe baroque orchestras La Cetra and Capriccio Basel are also based in Basel.\nIn May 2004, the fifth European Festival of Youth Choirs (Europ\u00e4isches Jugendchorfestival, or EJCF) opened; this Basel tradition started in 1992. Host of the festival is the local Basel Boys Choir.\nIn 1997, Basel contended to become the \"European Capital of Culture\", though the honor went to Thessaloniki.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Basel museums cover a broad and diverse spectrum of collections with a marked concentration in the fine arts. They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence in Europa. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.\n\nAntikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig Ancient cultures of the mediterranean museum\nAugusta Raurica Roman open-air museum\nBasel Paper Mill (German: Basler Papierm\u00fchle)\nBeyeler Foundation (Foundation Beyeler) Beyeler Museum (Fondation Beyeler)\nBotanical Garden Basel One of the oldest botanical gardens in the world\nCaricature & Cartoon Museum Basel (German: Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel)\nDollhouse Museum (German: Puppenhausmuseum) a museum housing the largest teddy bear collection in Europe.\nFoundation Fernet Branca (French: Fondation Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin near Basel.

One of the most important fairs for contemporary art worldwide is the Art Basel which was founded in 1970 by Ernst Beyeler and takes place in June each year. Baselworld, the watch and jewellery show (Uhren- und Schmuckmesse) one of the biggest fairs of its kind in Europe is held every year as well, and attracts a great number of tourists and dealers to the city. Live marketing company and fair organizer MCH Group has its head office in Basel.\n\nThe carnival of the city of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (Morgestraich) on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\nBasel Tattoo, founded in 2006 by the local Top Secret Drum Corps, has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. The Basel Tattoo annual parade, with an estimated 125,000 visitors, is considered the largest event in Basel. The event is now sponsored by the Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS), making it the official military tattoo of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThere are a number of culinary specialties originating in Basel, including Basler L\u00e4ckerli cookies and M\u00e4ssmogge candies. Being located in the meeting place between Switzerland, France and Germany the culinary landscape as a whole is very varied and diverse, making it a city with a great number of restaurants of all sorts.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nZoo Basel is, with over 1.7 million visitors per year, the most visited tourist attraction in Basel and the second most visited tourist attraction in Switzerland.Established in 1874, Zoo Basel is the oldest zoo in Switzerland and, by number of animals, the largest. Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide Indian rhinoceros birth and Greater flamingo hatch in a zoo. These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The football club FC Basel continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the 2008 European Championships, as well as Geneva, Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The championships were jointly hosted by Switzerland and Austria. BSC Old Boys and Concordia Basel are the other football teams in Basel.\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is ice hockey. Basel is home to the EHC Basel which plays in the MySports League, the third tier of the Swiss ice hockey league system. They play their home games in the 6,700-seat St. Jakob Arena. The team previously played in the National League and the Swiss League, but they had to fill a bankruptcy case after the 2013\u201314 Swiss League season.\nBasel features a large football stadium that has been awarded four stars by UEFA, a modern ice hockey hall, and an admitted sports hall.\n\nA large indoor tennis event takes place in Basel every October. Some of the best ATP-professionals play every year at the Swiss Indoors, including Switzerland's biggest sporting hero and frequent participant Roger Federer, a Basel native who describes the city as \"one of the most beautiful cities in the world\".\nThe annual Basel Rhine Swim draws several thousand visitors to the city to swim in or float on the Rhine river.While football and ice hockey are by far the most popular sports, basketball has a very small but faithful fan base. The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany.

Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 2.5% is used for growing crops and 1.3% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen system, Basel features a continental-influenced oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), due to its relatively far inland position. The city averages 120.4 days of rain or snow annually and on average receives 842 mm (33.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Basel receives an average of 99 mm (3.9 in) of rain. The month with the most days of precipitation is also May, with an average of 12.4 days.

Others are even located in France and Germany.\n\n\n=== Canton ===\nThe canton Basel-Stadt consists of three municipalities: Riehen, Bettingen, and the city Basel itself. The political structure and agencies of the city and the canton are identical.\n\n\n=== City ===\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nThe city itself has 19 quarters:\n\nGrossbasel (Greater Basel):\nKleinbasel (Lesser Basel):\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is In Silber ein schwarzer Baselstab. (Argent, a staff of Basel sable)\n(For \"staff\", see Heraldsnet website.)\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe canton's executive, the Executive Council (Regierungsrat), consists of seven members for a mandate period of 4 years. They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority. The president (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election, while the heads of the other departments are appointed by the collegiate. The current president is Dr Guy Morin. The executive body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (German: Rathaus) on the central Marktplatz.

The sessions of the Grand Council are public. Unlike the members of the Executive Council, the members of the Grand Council are not politicians by profession, but they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020. The legislative body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (Rathaus).\nThe last election was held on 23 October 2016 for the mandate period (Legislatur) of 2017\u20132021.

In the federal election, a total of 57,304 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 50.4%.\n\n\n==== Council of States ====\nOn 20 October 2019, in the federal election Eva Herzog, member of the Social Democratic Party      (SP), was elected for the first time as a State Councillor (St\u00e4nder\u00e4tin) in the first round as single representative of the canton of Basel-Town and successor of Anita Fetz in the national Council of States (St\u00e4nderat) with an absolute majority of 37'210 votes.On 18 October 2015, in the federal election State Councillor (German: St\u00e4nder\u00e4tin) Anita Fetz, member of the Social Democratic Party       (SP), was re-elected in the first round as single representative of the canton of Basel-Town in the national Council of States (St\u00e4nderat) with an absolute majority of 35'842 votes. She has been a member of it since 2003.\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\n\n==== Twin towns and sister cities ====\nBasel has two sister cities and a twinning among two states:\n Shanghai, China, since 2007\n US State Massachusetts, since 2002\n Miami Beach, US, since 2011\n\n\n==== Partner cities ====\n Rotterdam, Netherlands, since 1945\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nBasel has a population (as of August 2019) of 177,654.  As of 2015, 35.5% of the population are resident foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years (1999\u20132009 ) the population has changed at a rate of \u22120.3%. It has changed at a rate of 3.2% due to migration and at a rate of \u22123% due to births and deaths.Of the population in the municipality 58,560 or about 35.2% were born in Basel and lived there in 2000.

In this case, a room is defined as space of a housing unit of at least 4 m2 (43 sq ft) as normal bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens and habitable cellars and attics. About 10.5% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement).\nAs of 2000, there were 86,371 private households in the municipality, and an average of 1.8 persons per household. There were 44,469 households that consist of only one person and 2,842 households with five or more people.  Out of a total of 88,646 households that answered this question, 50.2% were households made up of just one person and there were 451 adults who lived with their parents.

The vacancy rate for the municipality, in 2010, was 0.74%.\n\n\n==== Historical population ====\n\n\n=== Language ===\nMost of the population (as of 2000) speaks German (129,592 or 77.8%), with Italian being second most common (9,049 or 5.4%) and French being third (4,280 or 2.6%). There are 202 persons who speak Romansh.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nFrom the 2000 census, 41,916 or 25.2% were Roman Catholic, while 39,180 or 23.5% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. Of the rest of the population, there were 4,567 members of an Orthodox church (or about 2.74% of the population), there were 459 individuals (or about 0.28% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 3,464 individuals (or about 2.08% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church.

There were 1,325 individuals (or about 0.80% of the population) who were Jewish, however only members of religious institutions are counted as such by the municipality, which makes the actual number of people of Jewish descent living in Basel considerably higher. There were 746 individuals who were Buddhist, 947 individuals who were Hindu and 485 individuals who belonged to another church. 52,321 (or about 31.41% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 8,780 individuals (or about 5.27% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nBasel is subdivided into 19 quarters (Quartiere). The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%. As of 2008, there were 18 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 9 businesses involved in this sector. 34,645 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,176 businesses in this sector. 120,130 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 8,908 businesses in this sector.

About 23.9% of the workforce coming into Basel are coming from outside Switzerland, while 1.0% of the locals commute out of Switzerland for work. Of the working population, 49.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 18.7% used a private car.\n\nThe Roche Tower, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, is 41 floors and 178 metres (584 ft) high, upon its opening in 2015 it has become the tallest building in Switzerland. Basel has also Switzerland's third tallest building (Basler Messeturm, 105 m (344 ft)) and Switzerland's tallest tower (St. Chrischona TV tower, 250 m (820 ft)).\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nThe Swiss chemical industry operates largely from Basel, and Basel also has a large pharmaceutical industry. Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel.

They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence in Europa. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.\n\nAntikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig Ancient cultures of the mediterranean museum\nAugusta Raurica Roman open-air museum\nBasel Paper Mill (German: Basler Papierm\u00fchle)\nBeyeler Foundation (Foundation Beyeler) Beyeler Museum (Fondation Beyeler)\nBotanical Garden Basel One of the oldest botanical gardens in the world\nCaricature & Cartoon Museum Basel (German: Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel)\nDollhouse Museum (German: Puppenhausmuseum) a museum housing the largest teddy bear collection in Europe.\nFoundation Fernet Branca (French: Fondation Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin near Basel.

Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide Indian rhinoceros birth and Greater flamingo hatch in a zoo. These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city.

The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

          "We very much enjoyed our visit. With elephants, rhinos, hippos, lions and giraffes, the zoo had pretty much all you want to see, with perhaps the exception of Tigers. The enclosures are brilliant (large indoor and outdoor viewing areas), and it was not too crowded.",
          "Nice place to visit. It is not too big. It would be great if they include some interesting facts about the animals. For us, it makes so much more interesting.",
          "Big but not too big. Plenty of shade and inside exhibits to escape the heat. Parking is a nightmare though and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars.",
          "The layout is really nice and we were able to see a variety of animals. Many animals were inside because it was December and kind of chilly. A few of the indoor spaces provided plenty of room for my toddler and his cousins to run around and \u2026",
          "Very unique small zoo. Great design. It doesn\u2019t look like a typical zoo, more like a park. You can see all birds flying through the zoo and big bird nest on the top of trees Pretty nice. Don\u2019t expect many animals there, but it gives kids great time. They love all cute animals there. Especially penguins.",
          "Fun zoo! Couldn\u2019t believe how cheap the tickets were to get in. Great selection of animals to look at. The enclosures were large and animal friendly. It was a nice way to spend a day!",
          "I was very impressed by how the Basel zoo looks like. This is how a zoo should look like. Great condition for the animal. I saw many of the zoos in my country Romania and none can rise to the level of this one in Basel. Congratulations to all who have been involved in organizing the zoo in Basel. Ypu did a great job.",
          "Nice place to go with kids. Occasionally they have pony riding between 2:30PM and 4PM for 1 euro (2 small rounds). I wish this would happen more regularly. Monkey house is nice and big, as is the elephant house. \nGiven that this is actually a family friendly place, I am surprised by a lot of smoking people.",
          "As much as looking at captive animals is not such a great pleasure, visiting Zoo Basel was a very informative experience. The zoo's design and research teams have done a great job and it's absolutely worth a few hours of your time.",
          "What an incredible zoo! One of my favorites I've ever been too; you can tell the animals are well cared for and loved. I really enjoyed how I could see the personalities and the silly quirks of each creature. Oh! And make sure you're there \u2026",
          "Basel Zoo is a good destination for a family trip. It's not big but quite cosy. I like very much the part of vivarium with a huge variety of different fish from seas and rivers. Take your time to enjoy this place.",

It's still hot, but very manageable, thanks to the shady trees.\nLots of rest rooms around , but drinking water fountains are next-to-none !!",
          "For those who like Zoos, this place is amazing. You can go first to the Fish/sea area, and then walk through all the other sections. Usually takes an entire morning to go there and visit the attractions. The people that work there are quite kind.",

          "I love this zoo. It's so huge that you need more than a day to explore it.",
          "A well-varied and maintained zoo. The hippos and orangutans were the highlights. Didn\u2019t get to see the baby rhino but the adult ones were also spectacular to see up close. The cafe was a bit over-priced though.",
          "We enjoyed visiting Zoo Basel. We went later in the day so there were barely any people around. We saw the penguins marching back to their habitat which was pretty cool. Many of the animals were in their indoor habitats for the day - we imagine this was due to the later hour in the day.",

          "When its cold you can watch the Penguins going for a walk, right next to you. It's safe for the kids to run around in the Zoo - perfect place to go on a cold winterday.

          "Just amazing. So fun with kids and safe too",
          "Visiting from the UK for the weekend, my friend and I visited Basel Zoo on a Saturday morning. The staff were friendly, the exhibits were many, and the animals looked happy. There was also one occasion where a member of staff had to swap \u2026",
          "It's a smaller zoo. They really keep in some animals from the cold, but have a way to at least show you the animals they have inside. They have more exotic animals. But it seems that the animals they do have are stressed, you can tell by \u2026",

          "This was a nice Zoo for an inner city one. I loved the Okapi, such a unique animal to have. I suppose the one downside was seeing the lions eat a zebra.....I understand it's natural and what they do in the wild and the Zoo doesn't want to waste an animal that passed away, but still shocked me haha.",

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors.

In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany.

The political structure and agencies of the city and the canton are identical.\n\n\n=== City ===\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nThe city itself has 19 quarters:\n\nGrossbasel (Greater Basel):\nKleinbasel (Lesser Basel):\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is In Silber ein schwarzer Baselstab. (Argent, a staff of Basel sable)\n(For \"staff\", see Heraldsnet website.)\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe canton's executive, the Executive Council (Regierungsrat), consists of seven members for a mandate period of 4 years. They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority. The president (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election, while the heads of the other departments are appointed by the collegiate.

Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020. The legislative body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (Rathaus).\nThe last election was held on 23 October 2016 for the mandate period (Legislatur) of 2017\u20132021.

In this case, a room is defined as space of a housing unit of at least 4 m2 (43 sq ft) as normal bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens and habitable cellars and attics. About 10.5% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement).\nAs of 2000, there were 86,371 private households in the municipality, and an average of 1.8 persons per household. There were 44,469 households that consist of only one person and 2,842 households with five or more people.

The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%.

About 23.9% of the workforce coming into Basel are coming from outside Switzerland, while 1.0% of the locals commute out of Switzerland for work. Of the working population, 49.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 18.7% used a private car.\n\nThe Roche Tower, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, is 41 floors and 178 metres (584 ft) high, upon its opening in 2015 it has become the tallest building in Switzerland. Basel has also Switzerland's third tallest building (Basler Messeturm, 105 m (344 ft)) and Switzerland's tallest tower (St. Chrischona TV tower, 250 m (820 ft)).\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nThe Swiss chemical industry operates largely from Basel, and Basel also has a large pharmaceutical industry.

The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel.

The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

        "wiki": "Art Basel is a for-profit, privately owned and managed, international art fair staged annually in Basel, Switzerland; Miami Beach, Florida; and Hong Kong. Art Basel works in collaboration with the host city's local institutions to help grow and develop art programs. While Art Basel provides a platform for galleries to show and sell their work to buyers, has gained a large international audience of art spectators and students.\n\n\n== Format ==\nA committee of four dealers reviewed art dealers' plans and select the winners in a four-day session several months ahead of each fair. As of 2019, the smallest galleries pay pay CHF 760 per square metre for a booth at Art Basel, and the largest galleries will pay CHF 905 per square metre. Prices rise relative to each additional square metre.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Basel, Switzerland ===\nArt Basel was started in 1970 by Basel gallerists Ernst Beyeler, Trudl Bruckner and Balz Hilt. In its inaugural year, the Basel show attracted more than 16,000 visitors who viewed work presented by 90 galleries representing 10 countries. Thirty art publishers also participated. By 1975, five years after its founding, the Basel show reached almost 300 exhibitors. The participating galleries came from 21 countries, attracting 37,000 visitors.\nUnder the stewardship of Marc Spiegler, the 2019 show in Basel attracted 93,000 visitors over six days. It presented 290 galleries from 35 countries, exhibiting the work of over 4,000 artists. A total of 19 galleries showed in Basel for the very first time. Alongside private collectors from Europe, America, and Asia, representatives and groups from over 400 museums and institutions from across the world were in attendance.In 2020, the 50th edition of the fair in Basel was at first postponed to September, but later canceled after many dealers cited concerns about travel and safety.\n\n\n=== Miami Beach, Florida ===\nArt Basel Miami Beach was first introduced in 2002 under the direction of Sam Keller.Spearheaded by Noah Horowitz, Art Basel's Director Americas, the 2019 show in Miami Beach, Florida, presented 269 leading international galleries from 29 countries. Over five days, the show attracted 81,000 visitors including private collectors and directors, curators, trustees and patrons of nearly 200 museum and institution groups. A total of 20 galleries showed in Miami Beach for the first time. In 2015, the show hosted first-time collectors from Cambodia, Ethiopia, Nicaragua, Romania, Togo, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n\nIn 2008, MCH Group, Angus Montgomery Arts and the events organiser Tim Etchells launched Art HK, sparking investor interest in Hong Kong. MCH bought it out in 2013 to create Art Basel Hong Kong, held at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. The 2019 Hong Kong Exhibition, directed by Adeline Ooi, attracted a record attendance of 88,000 visitors, among them directors, curators, trustees, and patrons from over 130 leading international museums and institutions. On display were 242 galleries from 35 countries and territories. The 2020 edition of the fair was cancelled due to the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\n== Initiatives ==\nArt Basel's initiatives concentrate on the broader art world. Art Basel has three main initiatives: Art Basel Cities, BMW Art Journey, Crowdfunding and The Art Market.\nArt Basel Cities is a project between Art Basel and cities worldwide to create cultural events and programming throughout the year. Art Basel, the city's local art stakeholders and the city's officials will sit together and develop a program in line with the city's mid- and long-term cultural development goals. This initiative was launched during the 2016 Hong Kong edition of Art Basel. Cities interested in the collaboration have to apply via an online questionnaire. The first partner city is Buenos Aires.BMW Art Journey Award is a grant that supports emerging creatives and enables them to go on an artistic journey of their own definition. In 2015, it was established by BMW and Art Basel to reward promising artists from the Discoveries sector in Hong Kong and the Positions sector in Miami Beach. The chosen artist can select the destination and go almost anywhere in the world to explore new ideas, discover new themes, and create new works. A winner is selected twice a year from a shortlist of three finalists during the Art Basel shows in Hong Kong and Miami Beach.\nThe Crowdfunding Initiative is a partnership between Kickstarter and Art Basel to provide visibility and generate support for projects from non-profit organizations around the world. The projects include artist residencies, education programs, public installations and other innovative artistic projects. They are selected by an independent jury made up of three non-profit art world specialists.The Art Market is an annual global art market analysis. It covers all aspects of the international market and highlights the most important developments in the previous year. The first report was published in 2017.Also, the executive-education program Collecting Contemporary Art in Hong Kong was launched by Art Basel, HKU SPACE Centre for Degree Programmes (CDP) and Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design (CSM).\n\n\n== Management ==\n\n\n=== Leadership ===\n1991-1999: Lorenzo Rudolf\n2000-2007: Sam Keller\n2007-2008: Cay Sophie Rabinowitz, Annette Sch\u00f6nholzer, Marc Spiegler\n2008-2012: Annette Sch\u00f6nholzer, Marc Spiegler\nsince 2012: Marc Spiegler\n\n\n=== Sponsorship ===\nUBS is the lead partner of the Art Basel in Basel since 1994, the lead partner of the Art Basel in Miami Beach since its inception in 2002 and the lead partner of the Art Basel in Hong Kong since its inception in 2013.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFranz Schultheis, Erwin Single, Stephan Egger, Thomas Mazzurana: When Art meets Money.

          "It's not the Louvre. It's not the National Gallery. It's not The Met. But it IS one really good, not so big/not so small art museum that runs the gamut of art history, from medieval to present-day. The building itself is big enough that it feels like a major art depot, but",

          "A must if one is in Basel; while not at the level of large art museums such as the Louvre, The Met in NYC or the Prada, if one is in Basel the collection is worth seeing. A relatively new wing houses a nice selection of contemporary art. The temporary exhibits are also of high",
          "This Beau-Art museum turn out to be a attraction you use as the most natural thing when living in Basel. I visit the new exhibitions, I come to re-discover some special paintings, I come to see the Swiss Mountains picture, before going to see the real thing, I just drop in when",

          "We spent all day here, and thoroughly enjoyed the art and the buildings. The Fuseli exhibition was a highlight. The Joseph Beuys permanent exhibition in the building by the river is well worth the pleasant walk.",
          "This really is a top-notch art museum, covering everything from Flemish masters, to Impressionists, to pop art and photography. There is a lovely collection of pieces of Swiss mountains that's worth seeing. Take your time to study the Holbein portraits. Go visit the new building",
          "Great art....so well worth a visit. My thoughts after a number of visits. Why, oh why, do you have to q outside in the cold in order to get your tickets? I just don't get this. Surely there is room inside for a ticket desk of some sort. The new building/neubau is brutal to look",

          "We had a lovely couple of hours going around the gallery looking at so many famous works of art. The Kunstmuseum Basel possesses the world`s largest collection of works by the Holbein family. There were very few visitors, even on a Saturday, so we could get very close to the",

          "This is a very interesting museum, although might be a bit too much if you\u2019re not a massive fun of paintings etc. Personally, I found the last 3rd modern arts part of the museum most interesting",
          "Had been meaning to visit for ages now that I spend a fair bit of time in Basel on business. Should have taken a day not 2 hours. The new building is impressive architecturally especially for the scale of each floor. The Chagall gives an interesting perspective on the artist\u2019s",
          "This was included in our Basel Art Pass. We visited the exhibition \"Chagall, the breakthrough years\", with paintings from the Jewish shtetl in Russia. Lunch in their caf\u00e9, reasonable.",

          "As said the art collection is fantastic, however it lacks information and at this time the museum is a construction site.",
          "Artworks were well-spaced and displayed, including great Impressionists and a modern, temporary display.",
          "The museum is in the city centre, with several trams stopping in front of the museum. I arrived with only an hour before the closing, but still had time enough to see the whole collection, which was nice but not very large. I cannot say anything about the price as the last hour",
          "A hugely varied collection from some of the world's great masters. Beautifully displayed (although it did help that I seemed to be the only person there on a Sunday)",
          "Quite expensive but not so many pictures to see. Please do not expect so much for the pictures. The restaurant was a good taste.",
          "This is a must in Basel with incerdible collection of modern art and classicla paintigs, nice building with a great flair",
          "We heard so much good about this museum so we went there with some expectations. Sadly it is not as good as we thought. Indeed, this is a good art museum with \"some\" nice collections. But it costed us 21 CHF for the entry for whole, with the special exhibition of Charles Ray",
          "I went to there for the Holbein collection, but was delighted to find its outstanding modern art collection. From impressionism, expressionism, cubism, to surrealism, all the modern masters are there. Picasso's works at various stages. It is a museum will excite any modern art",
          "A very enjoyable museum with an outstanding collection and a very spacious and pleasant display. Highly recommended!",
          "The quality of art displayed was very high given the size of the museum. Definitely worth a visit. Wish the gift store had more English language materials.",
          "We loved the permanent excibit, especially collection of Cranach and Holbein's paintings. Unfortunately 17-18 century halls were closed due to upcoming excibition. Very solid collection of impressionists, from Monet to Van Gogh and Cezanne.",
          "I was very impressed by the Kuntsmuseum. I am a fan of Monet and impressionist era art, and did not realize how much of it they have. A truly great afternoon was had. My only knock, and why I gave 4 and not 5 stars, is that the modern art wing runs hot and cold. Some great",
          "I visited Kunstmuseum Basel last August. It was an amazing surprise because of an impressive artistic inventory, definitely pour les connaisseurs, and from my pov, it\u2019s a two days visit gallery, for watch in silence, especially since it's not like this big crowded free galleries",
          "One of the best museums we have visited very spacious,interesting mix of art,enjoy the different styles of Picasso etc etc.The Charles Ray Exhibition was on when we visited what an exciting style of art.",
          "When I travel on business I always try to steal away on the weekend to local galleries and museums. I was happy to find such a great museum in Basel. The works there of Picasso, Manet, Chagall, Klee, etc are seldom seen works and certainly worth a visit.",
          "A whole day in an art gallery? Well, at least half a day. This kind of thing can be as demanding as a triathlon, but the generosity of space here - often, there's just one painting on a wall, or even in a room - makes the experience a very relaxed one, as if you're encouraged",
          "I liked kind a everything, there was nothing that i didn't like The waiters are very polite , the menu is great, indoor and out door are both very nice and elegant",
          "If you only see one museum in Basel, this would have to be the one! Fantastic art collection! Don't miss the works by Picasso, Chagall, Monet, Van Gogh and others. The museum is closed on Mondays, and your Swiss Pass gets you in free. We went Sunday afternoon and it was also",
          "Beautifully restored paintings from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, a large Impressionist section and more modern art too. Give yourself at least two hours to enjoy what is on offer!",
          "My son and I enjoyed a couple of hours at this museum last week. I could have spent at least two more hours there but it was hard with a 16 year old. We loved seeing art from the 1200's to the 1900's. We especially loved the Renoirs, Monets and Picassos. The older, religious",
          "Gorgeous selection , many famous names. Unfortunately even with student reduction very pricey! Worth a visit for art lovers.",
          "Excellent collection. Audio guide enhanced the experience. Nice restaurant and good food. I spent all day there but you could dip into the eras/genres of interest.",
          "Why did we not hear from this museum until we visited Basel? Unexpected and delightful with also a lovely courtyard to have a quiet lunch in the sun.",
          "This museum is one of the best here in Basel. It is located near the city centre and it is a must see. Went there on a raining sunday and was very upset I didn't have more time to look at all the pieces. The museum itself is not that huge but the collection is amazing and very",
          "You can't beat the location with a warm-weather bonus of sitting outside in the Museum's courtyard. Good food, a bit pricey but come for just coffee and a piece of cake if not a full meal.",
          "You can't visit Basel without coming here. The Kunstmuseum is an absolute delight. Beautifully laid out, the masterpieces are well displayed & labelled. Set aside 3 hours at a minimum to appreciate the collection. One of the few museums where you can browse, take your time &",
          "I live in NY and go to the Metropolitan often. Like the Louvre, you can get lost in there, and I still, after all these years, don't feel I really \"know\" the Met -- since, when I go, I go to see one or two exhibits. But the Kunstmuseum has a small but well chosen collection that",
          "This large museum has an incredible collection of art by many of the great masters. Their Holbein paintings are superb! In addition to many pieces by Dutch masters they also have paintings by Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Manet, Liebermann, Richter, Matisse, Rodin, Kirchner, etc.",
          "It's easy to get to - Tram 2. There were many excellent pieces by famous artists, as well as many from fairly obscure ones. The museum is easy to navigate and provided a nice morning of browsing and introspection. It is included in the Swiss Pass free museums",
          "The permanent exhibition is superb, i didnt expect that for a city like Basel (referring to its size!). It has pieces from many known artist covering all the important artistic eras. The temporary exhibitions dont disappoint either. The place is great, the building lovely,",
          "A wonderful museum - a gem at every turning. Especially noteworthy is the \"rose period\" Picasso, but this is just one special moment in a beautifully hung, light museum.",
          "I particularly recommend the special exhibition of Charles Ray's spectacular sculptures. And of course, the permanent collection is also worth a visit.",
          "Always presents very interesting temporary exhibitions. In the current temporary exhibition I was hoping to find more works by Malevich . I found more interesting the last room with the works of Lisitskij.",
          "This museum is a real gem. All the works beautifully hung in a spacious environment with very high ceilings. The light is also very good. The collection is amazing and wide-ranging. Also at times you can be the only visitor in a room so you can really commune with the artworks!",
          "The museum was just big enough to house some of the greatest artists of all time. I was blown away by the number of magnificent works on display. If Van Gogh, Matisse, Cezanne! Monet, and a long list of other great artists isn't your thing then don't go, their incredible works",
          "Amazing collection of art and extremely well displayed. Particularly liked the juxtaposition of Picasso and Braque.",
          "There were many excellent pieces by famous artists, as well as many from fairly obscure ones. The museum is easy to navigate and provided a nice afternoon of browsing and introspection.",
          "It's easy to get to - #2 Tram and unlike most things in Switzerland, it's open on a Sunday. Some new Picassos as well - very worthwhile. CHF15 a head is a bit steep but no more than most European museums.",
          "The Kunstmuseum is housed in an attractive courtyard building in old town Basel. The permanent collection is a mix of contemporary and impressionist art with works by Giacometti, Dali, Renoir, Monet, and Picasso. However, the overall collection is small and entry price is, well,",
          "If you are visiting Basel for work or leisure it is worth making time to spend a morning or afternoon at the Kunstmuseum. The museum houses impressive permanent collection, including works Dali, Renoir, Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh, but also has an extensive collection of pieces",
          "I first visited the Basel Kunstmuseum in 2003 and have been back at least once every year since. I think of it as an old friend. Unlike many other galleries, the works in the permanent collection don't move around so you can go straight to the Hoedler, the Boecklin, the Rodin,",
          "This was one of the museums I really wanted to see while in Basel, because of it's modern art collection. And I wasn't disappointed. The museum has a courtyard with several sculptures that you pass through before entering the galleries. This is a world class museum with one of",
          "It is worth visiting Basel for its amazing wealth of museums and galleries alone. We came to see the James Ensor exhibition, which was fantastic, and then walked round a jaw-dropping array of works by every 20th European century artist you care to name. Beautifully curated",
          "There are so many museums and so little time! Students go in for 8 chf and it was around 16 chf (might be a bit more) for adults non student. I recommend eating something before heading in (its enourmous and there's lots to see) Sadly- few signs had English translations",
          "Nice museum and incredible collection. It is a very pretty building with an incredible collection of impressionists, and contemporaries. It is very accesible from the old town. Everybody spoke English to us, so we could manage through easily.",
          "The museum is located near to the Munster and easy tram connections. The collection spans many genres and centuries. There are usually excellent touring exhibitions as well. Check on the opening times as the museum is doing construction.",
          "This museum is worth a trip to Basel. Excellent collection, interesting special shows (currently James Ensor, The surprised masks) and a prestigious building. A new annex is under construction presently and the museum will have to close Feb. 2015--Mar. 2016. Come to Basel and",
          "If you are a fan of museums, you must visit this place. Not only is the permanent collection amazing, the exhibitions are a must see.",
          "We decided to visit the museum because we had a couple of hours to kill before a flight. But a couple of hours was not enough! Masterpieces galore, and enough variety to keep everybody happy. I don't pretend to be an art expert, but this museum is enchanting. It allowed me to",
          "Brilliant ! Staff very helpful. Need a good few hours to go round . Would recommend the audio guide.Cafe good food and snacks.",
          "First of all the museum's collection is superb but maybe there was too much. It's bit exhausting to see so much.",
          "In knew the museum had an excellent collection but still I was surprised how impressive it really is. The layout and flow of the museum is well-designed. The Renaissance masters section includes many Holbein and Cranach paintings, the 19th and 20th century rooms feature Renoir,",
          "Well worth a visit as there are some beautiful works of art by some very famous artists. Good cafte/restaurant too and audio guide available.",
          "Basel has 40 museums in the city and this has got to be #1. It\u2019s a free entry with your Swiss pass. To walk into the courtyard and come across Rodin's \"Burghers of Calais\" was a surprise. All the Rodin sculptures were beautiful. The 19th Century Impressionist section \u2013 Renoir,",
          "Certainly one of the best art museums in the region. Be prepared to spend at least 2hs for there is a lot to see, and many pieces require some longer appreciation. I would say that the audio guide is not really worth it, and one will have to carry it around.",
          "Loved the variety of paintings within. The collections were so well-taken cared of. Being not so well- exposed to paintings, it was surreal to see those I saw only in books. Reemembering the lessons from our high school art teachers -it was only at this time that I truly",
          "Particularly enjoyed the Holbeins and 19th/20th century collection which included French impressionists and sculptures",
          "Great collection of art! I could have spent a lot longer here. The cream of all the museums that we visited in Switzerland.",
          "I greatly enjoyed a short visit to this gallery. I would make the following comments: - the contents are a roll call of the most prestigious late19/20th century artists. Picasso, Monet, Mondrian, Leger, Marc, Braque, Calder, Lichtenstein etc\u2026. A wonderful collection. But",
          "Amazingly high collection of Contemporary Art in an easily explorable building, with plenty of impressionism as well for good measure.Klee, Picasso, Monet, Manet, Renoir, Lautrec, Rousseau, Kandinsky, Lichtenstein..excellent works.",
          "Happy I used my 24 hour museum pass to go in, it would have been very expensive otherwise. I thought it was a bit sterile, lacking in interaction, information etc. the staff weren't exactly helpful either. Maybe it was just late in the day....... Lovely building though -",
          "Comfortably sized art museum near the top of Freiestrasse and Barfuesserplatz. Best to go there when there is a special exhibit on display (Warhol etc.) Nice cafe and gift shop on the groun floor.",
          "We found the Kunstmuseum very interesting. Some nice Paul Klees. The building was interesting with a wonderful central staircase.",
          "Although I visited Vienna, Madrid, Paris, New York etc. this is one of the finest art museums I've ever seen. The number of interesting and fantastic paintings (and sculptures) is really overwhelming. I particularly loved the works of Giacometti, Klee, Monet and Picasso, but",
          "From medieval to contemporary art, this museum is definitely worth to see and contains lot of interesting pieces. You can't get too close to the works of art because of the proximity alarm, and I've found this quite annoying in the medieval section, where you should be allowed",
          "Lots of space to admire the works, good staff. Well laid out and displayed, easy to find what the target pictures. Plenty to see and a good shop and cafe, too.",
          "Wonderful! Best place I visited in Basel. No crowds, no too big or overwhelming. Would happily pay to go again.",
          "This is an amazing museum (Basel has 40 museums in the city and this has got to be #1)-Their collection of modern art was especially impressive- currently a Mondrian-Newman-Flavin show is up that is excellent. A very nice collection of old masters as well--it is all beuatifully",
          "This is an excellent museum. Lots of impressionist and modern paintings (Picasso, Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Gaugin, Pisarro, etc) and a lot of Dutch masters. Also some very weird contemporary exhibits! Since it was a Sunday, very few cafes open so ate at the museum cafe which was",
          "Highly impressive collection of art from the middle ages to the most recent - such a small city and such a big sense of art and collection - and that special painting by Hans Holbein - jesu in the tomb - what pain, pin, and sadness - no glorification of sacrifice, but real human",
          "Quiet museum with outstanding masterpieces Staff very friendly Good value for the money Cafe was a little expensive for drinks",
          "Very relaxing. Went at 4pm and had museum almost to myself. Took tons of pics--I got lucky. They accept AmEx.",
          "Handy to the centre of Basel, with big, airy galleries and outstanding pictures. The Cranachs are particularly worth a detour, as are the Holbeins. OK cafeteria/restaurant charges for tap water, which is never good",
          "Incredible museuem. Rodin sculptures beautiful. You will enjoy every moment in this incredible spot. Each floor surprises and delights with the collections of a wide variety of painters and sculptors. Great cafe with a view of the sculpture garden. A great walk close to other",
          "Our family with three young children thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Kunstmuseum. We were fortunate to be there during the Picasso exhibit which my 10 year old really wanted to see. The museum isn't as large as I expected but we spent an enjoyable few hours there. The one",
          "The Kunstmuseum Basel - Fine Art Museum ranked number five of the \"world's 50 greatest galleries\" by the London newspaper \"The Times\". The Kunstmuseum Basel houses the largest and most significant public art collection in Switzerland, and is listed as a heritage site of national",
          "great layout and incredible art. It is very close to easy transportation and after walking through the museum there is a cafe where you can have a bite to eat.",
          "Surprisingly comprehensive collection; many 20th-century artists represented. Excellent gift shop. Not too crowded on weekday morning. Certainly worth a look.",
          "First went to this museum nearly 20 years ago. Possibly one of the finest art museums in the world. I absolutely love it! If ever in Basel, a visit the Kunstmuseum is a must.",
          "There was nothing to dislike; the collection is splendid! The Klee, the Burning Giraffe (Dali), Picasso (if that is how your taste runs). The lighting was perfect, the guards didn't haunt your every move, the paintings were very well hung. It is certainly one of the best art",
          "This museum entry fee is very reasonably priced. Great location, and is walking distance from any part of town (as most places in Basel are) The quality of the art is hands down unique and outstanding. I was lucky enough to discover new Monet, Picasso, and Renoir that I had",
          "In addition to a great overall collection of European art, museum had about 20 paintings by this overlooked artist - check it out!",
          "Really a great collection although for me the special collections a bit of an anticlimax. By the time I reached the final floor I wasn't feeling so good and I'm pretty sure it was the light. We also tried to dine in the restaurant which was quite busy but after 10mins of being",
          "Very comprehensive, and the courtyard filled with good sculpture. Excellent Picasso exhibition when I was there, .",
          "Compact yet felt much bigger than it actually is. The art has room to breath and allow for real space to enjoy the wide range of artists and mediums."

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany.

They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority. The president (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election, while the heads of the other departments are appointed by the collegiate.

Unlike the members of the Executive Council, the members of the Grand Council are not politicians by profession, but they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020. The legislative body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (Rathaus).\nThe last election was held on 23 October 2016 for the mandate period (Legislatur) of 2017\u20132021.

In this case, a room is defined as space of a housing unit of at least 4 m2 (43 sq ft) as normal bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens and habitable cellars and attics. About 10.5% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement).\nAs of 2000, there were 86,371 private households in the municipality, and an average of 1.8 persons per household. There were 44,469 households that consist of only one person and 2,842 households with five or more people.

The vacancy rate for the municipality, in 2010, was 0.74%.\n\n\n==== Historical population ====\n\n\n=== Language ===\nMost of the population (as of 2000) speaks German (129,592 or 77.8%), with Italian being second most common (9,049 or 5.4%) and French being third (4,280 or 2.6%). There are 202 persons who speak Romansh.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nFrom the 2000 census, 41,916 or 25.2% were Roman Catholic, while 39,180 or 23.5% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. Of the rest of the population, there were 4,567 members of an Orthodox church (or about 2.74% of the population), there were 459 individuals (or about 0.28% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 3,464 individuals (or about 2.08% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church.

There were 1,325 individuals (or about 0.80% of the population) who were Jewish, however only members of religious institutions are counted as such by the municipality, which makes the actual number of people of Jewish descent living in Basel considerably higher. There were 746 individuals who were Buddhist, 947 individuals who were Hindu and 485 individuals who belonged to another church. 52,321 (or about 31.41% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 8,780 individuals (or about 5.27% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nBasel is subdivided into 19 quarters (Quartiere). The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%. As of 2008, there were 18 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 9 businesses involved in this sector. 34,645 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,176 businesses in this sector. 120,130 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 8,908 businesses in this sector.

Of the working population, 49.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 18.7% used a private car.\n\nThe Roche Tower, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, is 41 floors and 178 metres (584 ft) high, upon its opening in 2015 it has become the tallest building in Switzerland. Basel has also Switzerland's third tallest building (Basler Messeturm, 105 m (344 ft)) and Switzerland's tallest tower (St. Chrischona TV tower, 250 m (820 ft)).\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nThe Swiss chemical industry operates largely from Basel, and Basel also has a large pharmaceutical industry. Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel. Prior to the formation of Swiss International Air Lines, the regional airline Crossair was headquartered near Basel.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nBasler Zeitung (\"BaZ\") and bz Basel are the local newspapers. The local TV station is called Telebasel. The German-speaking Swiss Radio and Television SRF company, part of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR, holds offices in Basel as well. The academic publishers Birkh\u00e4user, Karger and MDPI are based in Basel.\n\n\n=== Trade fairs ===\nImportant trade shows include Art Basel, the world's most important fair for modern and contemporary art, Baselworld (watches and jewelry), Swissbau (construction and real estate) and Igeho (hotels, catering, take-away, care).

They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence in Europa. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.\n\nAntikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig Ancient cultures of the mediterranean museum\nAugusta Raurica Roman open-air museum\nBasel Paper Mill (German: Basler Papierm\u00fchle)\nBeyeler Foundation (Foundation Beyeler) Beyeler Museum (Fondation Beyeler)\nBotanical Garden Basel One of the oldest botanical gardens in the world\nCaricature & Cartoon Museum Basel (German: Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel)\nDollhouse Museum (German: Puppenhausmuseum) a museum housing the largest teddy bear collection in Europe.\nFoundation Fernet Branca (French: Fondation Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin near Basel.

Live marketing company and fair organizer MCH Group has its head office in Basel.\n\nThe carnival of the city of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (Morgestraich) on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\nBasel Tattoo, founded in 2006 by the local Top Secret Drum Corps, has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the Edinburgh Military Tattoo.

Being located in the meeting place between Switzerland, France and Germany the culinary landscape as a whole is very varied and diverse, making it a city with a great number of restaurants of all sorts.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nZoo Basel is, with over 1.7 million visitors per year, the most visited tourist attraction in Basel and the second most visited tourist attraction in Switzerland.Established in 1874, Zoo Basel is the oldest zoo in Switzerland and, by number of animals, the largest. Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide Indian rhinoceros birth and Greater flamingo hatch in a zoo. These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The football club FC Basel continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the 2008 European Championships, as well as Geneva, Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The championships were jointly hosted by Switzerland and Austria. BSC Old Boys and Concordia Basel are the other football teams in Basel.\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is ice hockey. Basel is home to the EHC Basel which plays in the MySports League, the third tier of the Swiss ice hockey league system. They play their home games in the 6,700-seat St. Jakob Arena. The team previously played in the National League and the Swiss League, but they had to fill a bankruptcy case after the 2013\u201314 Swiss League season.\nBasel features a large football stadium that has been awarded four stars by UEFA, a modern ice hockey hall, and an admitted sports hall.\n\nA large indoor tennis event takes place in Basel every October. Some of the best ATP-professionals play every year at the Swiss Indoors, including Switzerland's biggest sporting hero and frequent participant Roger Federer, a Basel native who describes the city as \"one of the most beautiful cities in the world\".\nThe annual Basel Rhine Swim draws several thousand visitors to the city to swim in or float on the Rhine river.While football and ice hockey are by far the most popular sports, basketball has a very small but faithful fan base. The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany. As of 2016, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018). The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007. Basel is the most densely populated city in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBasel has an area, as of 2009, of 23.91 square kilometers (9.23 sq mi). Of this area, 0.95 km2 (0.37 sq mi) or 4.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.88 km2 (0.34 sq mi) or 3.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.67 km2 (7.98 sq mi) or 86.4% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.45 km2 (0.56 sq mi) or 6.1% is either rivers or lakes.Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 10.2% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 40.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 24.0%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.7% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 8.9%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 2.5% is used for growing crops and 1.3% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen system, Basel features a continental-influenced oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), due to its relatively far inland position. The city averages 120.4 days of rain or snow annually and on average receives 842 mm (33.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Basel receives an average of 99 mm (3.9 in) of rain. The month with the most days of precipitation is also May, with an average of 12.4 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 45 mm (1.8 in) of precipitation over 8.4 days.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThe city of Basel functions as the capital of the Swiss half-canton of Basel-Stadt, though several of its suburbs are located in the half-canton of Basel-Landschaft or the canton of Aargau. Others are even located in France and Germany.\n\n\n=== Canton ===\nThe canton Basel-Stadt consists of three municipalities: Riehen, Bettingen, and the city Basel itself. The political structure and agencies of the city and the canton are identical.\n\n\n=== City ===\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nThe city itself has 19 quarters:\n\nGrossbasel (Greater Basel):\nKleinbasel (Lesser Basel):\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is In Silber ein schwarzer Baselstab. (Argent, a staff of Basel sable)\n(For \"staff\", see Heraldsnet website.)\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe canton's executive, the Executive Council (Regierungsrat), consists of seven members for a mandate period of 4 years. They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority.

About 10.5% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement).\nAs of 2000, there were 86,371 private households in the municipality, and an average of 1.8 persons per household. There were 44,469 households that consist of only one person and 2,842 households with five or more people.

There were 1,325 individuals (or about 0.80% of the population) who were Jewish, however only members of religious institutions are counted as such by the municipality, which makes the actual number of people of Jewish descent living in Basel considerably higher. There were 746 individuals who were Buddhist, 947 individuals who were Hindu and 485 individuals who belonged to another church. 52,321 (or about 31.41% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 8,780 individuals (or about 5.27% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nBasel is subdivided into 19 quarters (Quartiere). The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%.

Of the working population, 49.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 18.7% used a private car.\n\nThe Roche Tower, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, is 41 floors and 178 metres (584 ft) high, upon its opening in 2015 it has become the tallest building in Switzerland. Basel has also Switzerland's third tallest building (Basler Messeturm, 105 m (344 ft)) and Switzerland's tallest tower (St. Chrischona TV tower, 250 m (820 ft)).\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nThe Swiss chemical industry operates largely from Basel, and Basel also has a large pharmaceutical industry. Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel.

They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence in Europa. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.\n\nAntikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig Ancient cultures of the mediterranean museum\nAugusta Raurica Roman open-air museum\nBasel Paper Mill (German: Basler Papierm\u00fchle)\nBeyeler Foundation (Foundation Beyeler) Beyeler Museum (Fondation Beyeler)\nBotanical Garden Basel One of the oldest botanical gardens in the world\nCaricature & Cartoon Museum Basel (German: Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel)\nDollhouse Museum (German: Puppenhausmuseum) a museum housing the largest teddy bear collection in Europe.\nFoundation Fernet Branca (French: Fondation Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin near Basel.

One of the most important fairs for contemporary art worldwide is the Art Basel which was founded in 1970 by Ernst Beyeler and takes place in June each year. Baselworld, the watch and jewellery show (Uhren- und Schmuckmesse) one of the biggest fairs of its kind in Europe is held every year as well, and attracts a great number of tourists and dealers to the city. Live marketing company and fair organizer MCH Group has its head office in Basel.\n\nThe carnival of the city of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (Morgestraich) on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\nBasel Tattoo, founded in 2006 by the local Top Secret Drum Corps, has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. The Basel Tattoo annual parade, with an estimated 125,000 visitors, is considered the largest event in Basel. The event is now sponsored by the Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS), making it the official military tattoo of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThere are a number of culinary specialties originating in Basel, including Basler L\u00e4ckerli cookies and M\u00e4ssmogge candies. Being located in the meeting place between Switzerland, France and Germany the culinary landscape as a whole is very varied and diverse, making it a city with a great number of restaurants of all sorts.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nZoo Basel is, with over 1.7 million visitors per year, the most visited tourist attraction in Basel and the second most visited tourist attraction in Switzerland.Established in 1874, Zoo Basel is the oldest zoo in Switzerland and, by number of animals, the largest. Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide Indian rhinoceros birth and Greater flamingo hatch in a zoo. These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The football club FC Basel continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the 2008 European Championships, as well as Geneva, Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The championships were jointly hosted by Switzerland and Austria. BSC Old Boys and Concordia Basel are the other football teams in Basel.\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is ice hockey. Basel is home to the EHC Basel which plays in the MySports League, the third tier of the Swiss ice hockey league system. They play their home games in the 6,700-seat St. Jakob Arena. The team previously played in the National League and the Swiss League, but they had to fill a bankruptcy case after the 2013\u201314 Swiss League season.\nBasel features a large football stadium that has been awarded four stars by UEFA, a modern ice hockey hall, and an admitted sports hall.\n\nA large indoor tennis event takes place in Basel every October. Some of the best ATP-professionals play every year at the Swiss Indoors, including Switzerland's biggest sporting hero and frequent participant Roger Federer, a Basel native who describes the city as \"one of the most beautiful cities in the world\".\nThe annual Basel Rhine Swim draws several thousand visitors to the city to swim in or float on the Rhine river.While football and ice hockey are by far the most popular sports, basketball has a very small but faithful fan base. The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

          "The museum offered alot of interactive activities (for free) along with the interesting history of making paper. At the museum paper for special occasions is still being produced manually, which can be seen when visiting it. Make sure you take enough time to visit the museum",
          "This is one of my favorite museums in Basel. It is located in an old mill so the house in itself is interesting with small rooms, low ceilings, narrow staircases. I learned about paper production in the old days and also the way people lived in Basel at that time. You can try",

          "Only 7.50 CHF entry with the Basel card, a great value for all the exhibits and demonstrations of this museum. We made our own paper, used a quill pen, did embossing, and learned a lot about Basel's role in history. My husband had scoffed at the idea of touring this museum, but",
          "This museum shows so much more than 'the crafts related to paper and book-production'. (This always remains fascinating because so many of these activities are now taken for granted.) I just went to the museum to make photographs of the absolutely unique replica of a 1772",
          "Excellent couple of hours spent here. Right next to the river Rhine. The building is beautiful. Lost to see and do. Including making your own paper to keep. Writing and marbling with colours. Old style printing can be done as well. Great way to spend some time. And use your",

          "I was a bit skeptical about the Basel Paper museum, but it deserves its ranking and is not to be missed in Basel. This is a hand on museum where you get to make paper, do a print and emboss it, calligraphy and art design. Best to get there early before it gets busy for a",

          "OK, so it's a paper mill. Boring right? WRONG! As several have pointed out, it ended up being a lot more fun than you could imagine. Four-year-old liked the hands-on activities and adults were stimulated by the cool exhibits. The name doesn't do it justice. \"Paper Mill Museum\"",
          "We had the opportunity to be guided by Carlos, who was a fantastic and informative guide. The museum is kind of a hands-on tour, and the history about the first paper sheets produced was fascinating. Muito obrigada, Carlos!",

          "I didn't plan on visiting the paper mill because it was,... well, a paper mill. I'm so glad that we decided to use our last day in Basel at this intelligent, interesting and well put together museum. I appreciated that they had signs in English too. The best part was that this",
          "Had a great time with the history of paper (surprisingly interesting rather thn what one might think) Spend at least 2 hours here making paper and learing to write calligraphy. Well worth the time",
          "My wife and I throughly enjoyed our visit here. Following the history of paper. From how it was made hundreds of years ago (using the equipment from Hundreds of years ago) to the history of writing, language, ink & printing. We printed our own paper, wrote on it with quills,",

          "Interesting for all, but there is a small room on the top floor that kids and adults will really like. You take three colours of ink, drop them in a liquid, mix it up, and then cover it with a paper. Its fun to see the designs that are created. The museum is very informative,",
          "Beautiful facility, takes you through making paper, printing on paper, binding paper, etc. You can even make your own paper, create a cool watercolor design, try out calligraphy, etc. Very interactive and hands on. Great exhibits and museum overall. Free if you have the",
          "If you go to the Paper Mill Museum you jump in the past, to see how this art started and continues. Super nice the Mill with water. There you can see many types of paper and presses, as well as different types of writing. The staff shows people how things were done in the past.",
          "This isn't something you see very often, which is typical of Basel, lots of unusual attractions. Its a intresting tour, which feels more suited to kids, but still good non the less.",

          "Great mix of technique and history, of hands on experiences and of reading parts. The restaurant also deserves praise!",
          "Great museum. Lots for both adults and children to do. Thoroughly enjoyable few hours spent exploring the different rooms",
          "Have been several times. Love taking my children here, though toddlers are difficult to manage with all the machines and grabbing opportunities. take your baby carrier if you use such a thing (although there's a lift it's confusing and there are tight spaces for the buggy).",
          "When we first arrived it was so, but so cold - seven degrees below zero - but the sun was shinning. The path til the museum is just beautiful; the wheel was frozen with ice all over. The lady at the museum shop was very kind and let us stay inside until the museum open (we",
          "I'd been staying in Basel several weeks before I actually paid to go through this museum. It's terrific with hands on activities for all. You can get close up to all sorts of printing tools and the historic displays are excellent. I highly recommend going, especially is you are",
          "This is by far one of the best museum in Switzerland. I am a regular visitor with my students to whom the world of printing and paper and its importance in Europe and beyond is perfectly - in every sendse - explained. The students are invited to different activities. An",

          "Incredible place for history buffs - I had gone with low expectations and ended up spending around 3 hours there!",
          "It starts off showing you how paper was made. And it wasn't with wood! You can have a go at making paper from the prepared pulp. The next floor up tells you about the development of the written language around the world. On this floor you can write using quills. 2nd floor is",

          "The museum is educational and enjoyable with lots to see and opportunities to try out various paper making and printing processes. It's helpful that explanation boards are provided in both English and German. Admission is half price with a Basel travel card.",
          "This site is located something upward from the Stone Bridge, on the left shore of Rhein River. We had just enjoyed in what this museum had to show to us, the visitors. It is set on a medieval canal with an operating waterwheel, so in this way the old paper mill has been turned",

          "We almost visited as an after thought and we were so glad that we did. Our only regret is that we got there at 4:00 pm and they close at 5:00. The collection is amazing and the active paper making mill is something to see and all the better because you can make your own piece",
          "Not open on a Monday!!! Make sure you prioritise doing this any other day of the week! I nearly missed my opportunity to go because I didn't check the times. Their website is no longer offered in English annoying so use Google translate to check them. Right so this place is",

          "Oh my goodness, this place was absolutely wonderful! I definitely recommend to anyone who's going to Basel or near Basel - it's worth the entrance fee, and it was so much fun! Educational and a hands-on museum, we were given the opportunities to make paper, stamp stuff, try out",
          "I like education museums but get easily bored, this was great as I got to make some fresh paper, in the form of a passport cover, then went round and made some other things. The most interesting floor by far is the ground floor with the paper, so if you are budgeting your time",
          "There are one workshop on each floor and they are all included in the admission! The museum is quite detailed in the history of paper making, writing, printing and book making. You'll get a clear idea of how all these developed after a visit. Worth a visit!!",
          "Unfortunately we visited on a Saturday morning, the actual museum was closed for a function, but was open at 1pm, so we only saw the outside. With its working mill wheel and the water being channeled into the Rhine there were lots of areas to look at outside which I would",
          "Visited this museum a year ago but still feel compelled to write a review for it, such was the enjoyment of my visit. You start out with the history of paper-making with influences from ancient Egypt and China, including what used to pass as a toilet paper before its marvellous",
          "For you to get excited about this place, you gotta be obssessed with everything about paper. It allows you a hands-on experience about the old ways of making paper, producing your own paper you can bring home. the mill is run by a water wheel which makes the place quite quaint.",
          "Much for kids aged 7 - 13 to see, do and experience. Wheelchair access, cafe next door, good for a 2 hour visit. Would not recommend it for kids who like to quickly go through places or who get quickly bored. A tad out of the way (but not much), good 10 minute walk from public",
          "Chance to produce own , with use of traditional fonts and type faces. plenty of history and facts, good gift shop",
          "We arrived in Basle on a Sunday but nevertheless, we still found it difficult to park near the river as the museum does not have its own car park and will be very difficult in the summer months. Once we paid our entrance fee, we had a sticker to enable us to come and go. There",
          "We liked that each floor is covering different stages of a book history. From paper manufacturing to writing, printing and binding with hands-on activities in each section and passionate people explaining each step.",
          "I had a dual recommendation for this as well as having seen it on tripadvisor. The museum is in a working papermill complete with waterwheel. Set on four levels the museum takes you through the story of paper, how it is made and how it is used. On each level there is an activity",
          "Fascinating museum with lots of hands on activities for all ages. Information in English as well as German. Really helpful and friendly staff.",
          "We arrived that the kitchen was about to close, but they quickly found an alternative that made me and my kids happy - relaxed, friendly atmosphere with home made food",
          "A great visit with our three children (6/8/12 years) lots of hands on activities including papermaking, embossing, printing and marbleizing. Interesting info from invention of alphabet to modern computing. Signage in German, French and English. People working there spoke",
          "you can learn how paper is made, workshops to do it by yourself walk along the river and see a part of historic Basel",
          "very interesting if you are in the area. Unless it is something you are really interested in then have it as a can see because you are strolling through this part of Basel",
          "handmade paper, wax seals, was all fun for my friend, her daughter and my own self (once more). Loved also the adjacent Caf\u00e9, although on the pricey side. They have very nice cakes and service is friendly.",
          "This is a feast of information and hands on experiences for those interested in the history of paper making, book binding and writing....really, anything to do with items made from paper. Watch paper being made. And for children and adults alike, you can make your own sheets of",
          "I loved this place! It was definitely worth the 15 chf admission for an adult ticket. Prices are 13 chf for students/seniors, 9 chf for kids 6-16, and free for younger kids. I easily spent 3 hours here and would have stayed longer if I could have, especially since I realized",
          "On the south shore of the Rhine River lies a novel little museum tucked away behind a restaurant and a crazy little path. You can find the place just by listening for the gentle grinding and splashing of the paddle wheel churning away. The museum cost 38 francs for our family of",
          "Great place to visit! Made paper by screening pulp the old fashion way. Could also print using type setting, and made our own marbled paper by hand. Great displays in an old working paper mill where they still do everything by hand.",
          "This is an unusual museum because it is still a working paper mill and printshop. We made paper by hand - as an overgrown kid I had to wait my turn behind the real children but it was definitely worth it. There were demonstrations throughout the 4 floors.",
          "Very entertaining and attractive museum for all generations,where can you create your own paper and see how people was made it in history.",
          "What a great museum to visit. It was really interactive and you were encouraged to get stuck in. The exhibits and information was just right. Not too big, not too small. Downside is slightly excessive enterance fee!",
          "Highly recommend this wonderful mill which takes up about 4 floors. Lots of activities to get involved in- not just for the kids- we made our own paper, had a go at marbelling, and used a printing press. This is a real star attraction",
          "Every single child from 3 to 9 will love it as it is cute and very intera tube. It is very interesting for adults too. It is located in a beautiful area of Basel. It is highly reccomended to tale the little boat to go on the other side of the river.",
          "This was a real eye-opener! We had no idea of the role that Basel\u2019s paper mills had played in the development of the printed word. Unfortunately, although there are signs in English, there are not many detailed explanations, but that didn\u2019t stop us from enjoying the displays",
          "As a working Paper Mill you actually gets to see paper being made, books bound, type setting and mold making and you can do some of the tasks yourself, On four floors with plenty to keep various ages occupied it's a very good way to spend a few hours (the restaurant is good",
          "Great museum! We love making paper and then building type characters and printing on the paper with a print machine!",
          "The museum is just nice! you can experience the paper making with the basler cantonal watermark, printing, etc. There is also the museum tour about the balser paper history. This is also worth to visit!",
          "Had a good time visiting the museum. Learned a lot about how paper is made and printing. Would definitely recommend to all ages.",
          "At first I was very reluctant in going to this museum as I thought 'how can a museum about paper be interesting?' Well, the museum is well-worth the visit and it is not only about paper but the printing process as well. I also found fun to make my own paper and to seal a letter",
          "Do not miss this Papermill Museum in Basel. This will be one of the highlights of your trip. The way they made paper in the olden days is quite remarkable. You also have the chance to make a piece of your own paper. Only takes about an hour to tour the museum, and then you can",
          "Exacltly the kind of historical museum i like most. It explains the basics of the making of paper & i learned a lot. then, from the basics principples, we go to more and more advanced technologies. Bonus added: on printing, making book, languages. A gem.",
          "We took a private tour of the museum and it was well worth the money. Our tour guide, Bea, was amazing! She made the process of history throughout the ages come alive with her enthusiasm and knowledge. We made our own paper, used two very old stamp machines, a typewriter, and",
          "If you want to experience a medieval city and get into what it must have been like visit the paper mill where the mill wheel still goes round and round generating pump power.",
          "We walked to the paper mill museum. It was very interesting and had many facts and photos from history. English was on all signs. Friendly staff.",
          "We loved our visit to the paper mill. You not only learn by seeing but by trying to make by yourself all the processes regarding paper, writing, printing embossing etc. I highly recommend to everybody",
          "If you like history it is a must! Staff excellent .Cafe cakes very large and cheap for Basel. Just lovely to walk round inside and outside.",
          "Perfect museum !! Interactive!! You make paper with the traditional way by yourself and then you can print on it (traditionally) !!! Don't miss it",

          "Just a really engaging museum. We were there for 3 hours and saw how to produce paper and all the printing machines during the ages!",
          "The visitors have the opportunity to make their own paper from scratch, but also can try different techniques for writing (quilt, pen, stift, etc), as well as various printing techniques. The kids will love it and it makes a great day for the entire family!",
          "Very picturesque part of this wonderful city. Go there and have a coffee. You will not be disappointed as you sit by the water wheel and listen to an old part of industry at work.",
          "There was something for the whole family in this museum. My children especially like making their own paper and type setting their names into handmade letterhead stationary. The person working with the molten iron was interesting - really engaging.",
          "Authentic working paper mill. Great for children. Nice cafe for lunch and cafe/wine next door. The water for the mill cascades down right next door.",
          "Nobody believed me that this would be a fun experience, especially given the price of admission, but just knowing we would make paper was enough of a draw for me. My entire family enjoyed the process of making paper but that's not all there was! We also got to write with",
          "we visited with 6 adults and a wonderful time was had by all. the museum itself is in a beautiful location, with the mill wheel still functional. in addition to the interesting exhibitions, there are opportunities to try your hand at a few aspects of paper and book making.",

          "This museum is a fabulous little piece of history! The house itself is worth visiting, if you like authentic and beautifully-preserved Swiss architecture. The tour is phenomenal, and a wonderfully interactive for kinesthetic learners like myself! I can't wait to take our",
          "All what you wanted to know about paper-making and book-printing. Staff is really knowledgeable and customer-friendly. In a very nice corner of the old town, away from the busy main tourist areas, really worth a detour - also with your children.",
          "Very informative on many levels--simple to sophisticated. A super family stop and a picturesque location right on the Rhine. Not too far from the Munster.",
          "The highlight of my trip to Basel last weekend was the Paper Museum, with its history of alphabets, writing, making paper and printing. The building itself (500+ years) is wonderful, and with all these machines lying around, and all the displays, and all the intelligently laid",
          "The sound of the water mill drew us to this excellent museum. The paper making and history of writing and type-setting was very well displayed and explained. What a wonderful place - thank you!!!",
          "Housed in the old paper mill, this museum gives you the entire history of paper making and writing with a few interactive activities that will interest children. You can learn to write with a feather pen, stamp papers, and make your own paper.",

          "I went there with my wife and son. Was not really sure about it, my son can be pretty winy at places he finds boring, however he had a lot of fun. I had a lot of fun too, making your own paper, writing with old feathers like in the movies, as well as lots of fun information...",
          "This is a very good museum but does not open until 11am. We got there early and then went for a walk by the river until it opened as there is not much to do around there although it is only 15-20 minute walk into town. There is a wonderful working water wheel just outside the",
          "Museum is very interessting. Of course you can do your own paper but besides this I really appreciated the review of the printing industry from the Egyptian till today. A place to visit even with kids as they can draw with some old feather .",
          "There is so much information in this compact museum in an old paper mill building. It is very hands-on and thorough. The displays are very well presented and someone has gone to a lot of effort to make the building beautiful, with stenciled walls and ceilings. From the proces",

          "We were only in Basel for a day and spent much of our time just wandering the beautiful city, mainly walking along the river. Simply by accident, we happened upon the Basler Papiermuhle. It was near an attractive little square and we were simply drawn inside by the lovely",
          "The name didn't thrill me so I was initially reluctant to go, but when I got to the area I was amazed by its beauty! You can see the rhine from the river and there are old beautiful buildings lining the nearby streets. The museum its self is a great place to go! We learned how",
          "We really enjoyed this museum, watching paper being made and exploring various aspects of paper making and printing. You get to do it yourself at each step of the way, making paper, writing with quill pens, making a book cover and so on. The only drawback was that there was a",

          "I found it really interesting learning the history of writing and how they used to make paper. I really lived it, I only wish I got to spend more time here as I unfortunately arrived near closing time. They'll also make a wax seal for you and you write with the old fashion",

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany.

They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority. The president (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election, while the heads of the other departments are appointed by the collegiate.

Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020. The legislative body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (Rathaus).\nThe last election was held on 23 October 2016 for the mandate period (Legislatur) of 2017\u20132021.

In this case, a room is defined as space of a housing unit of at least 4 m2 (43 sq ft) as normal bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens and habitable cellars and attics. About 10.5% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement).\nAs of 2000, there were 86,371 private households in the municipality, and an average of 1.8 persons per household. There were 44,469 households that consist of only one person and 2,842 households with five or more people.

The vacancy rate for the municipality, in 2010, was 0.74%.\n\n\n==== Historical population ====\n\n\n=== Language ===\nMost of the population (as of 2000) speaks German (129,592 or 77.8%), with Italian being second most common (9,049 or 5.4%) and French being third (4,280 or 2.6%). There are 202 persons who speak Romansh.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nFrom the 2000 census, 41,916 or 25.2% were Roman Catholic, while 39,180 or 23.5% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. Of the rest of the population, there were 4,567 members of an Orthodox church (or about 2.74% of the population), there were 459 individuals (or about 0.28% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 3,464 individuals (or about 2.08% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church.

There were 1,325 individuals (or about 0.80% of the population) who were Jewish, however only members of religious institutions are counted as such by the municipality, which makes the actual number of people of Jewish descent living in Basel considerably higher. There were 746 individuals who were Buddhist, 947 individuals who were Hindu and 485 individuals who belonged to another church. 52,321 (or about 31.41% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 8,780 individuals (or about 5.27% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nBasel is subdivided into 19 quarters (Quartiere). The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%. As of 2008, there were 18 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 9 businesses involved in this sector. 34,645 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,176 businesses in this sector. 120,130 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 8,908 businesses in this sector.

About 23.9% of the workforce coming into Basel are coming from outside Switzerland, while 1.0% of the locals commute out of Switzerland for work. Of the working population, 49.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 18.7% used a private car.\n\nThe Roche Tower, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, is 41 floors and 178 metres (584 ft) high, upon its opening in 2015 it has become the tallest building in Switzerland. Basel has also Switzerland's third tallest building (Basler Messeturm, 105 m (344 ft)) and Switzerland's tallest tower (St. Chrischona TV tower, 250 m (820 ft)).\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nThe Swiss chemical industry operates largely from Basel, and Basel also has a large pharmaceutical industry. Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel. Prior to the formation of Swiss International Air Lines, the regional airline Crossair was headquartered near Basel.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nBasler Zeitung (\"BaZ\") and bz Basel are the local newspapers. The local TV station is called Telebasel. The German-speaking Swiss Radio and Television SRF company, part of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR, holds offices in Basel as well. The academic publishers Birkh\u00e4user, Karger and MDPI are based in Basel.\n\n\n=== Trade fairs ===\nImportant trade shows include Art Basel, the world's most important fair for modern and contemporary art, Baselworld (watches and jewelry), Swissbau (construction and real estate) and Igeho (hotels, catering, take-away, care). The Swiss Sample Fair (\"Schweizer Mustermesse\") was the largest and oldest consumer fair in Switzerland. It was held from 2007 to 2019 and took place in Kleinbasel on the right bank of the Rhine.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBesides Humanism the city of Basel has also always been very famous for its achievement in the field of mathematics. Among others, the mathematician Leonhard Euler and the Bernoulli family have done research and been teaching at the local institutions for centuries. In 1910 the Swiss Mathematical Society was founded in the city and in the mid-twentieth century the Russian mathematician Alexander Ostrowski taught at the local university. \nIn 2000 about 57,864 or (34.7%) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 27,603 or (16.6%) have completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule).

They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence in Europa. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.\n\nAntikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig Ancient cultures of the mediterranean museum\nAugusta Raurica Roman open-air museum\nBasel Paper Mill (German: Basler Papierm\u00fchle)\nBeyeler Foundation (Foundation Beyeler) Beyeler Museum (Fondation Beyeler)\nBotanical Garden Basel One of the oldest botanical gardens in the world\nCaricature & Cartoon Museum Basel (German: Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel)\nDollhouse Museum (German: Puppenhausmuseum) a museum housing the largest teddy bear collection in Europe.\nFoundation Fernet Branca (French: Fondation Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin near Basel.

Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide Indian rhinoceros birth and Greater flamingo hatch in a zoo. These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The football club FC Basel continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the 2008 European Championships, as well as Geneva, Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The championships were jointly hosted by Switzerland and Austria. BSC Old Boys and Concordia Basel are the other football teams in Basel.\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is ice hockey.

The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

          "This is a very small park, but it's lovely. Some hot houses that are being renovated as of summer, 2020, and outdoor space with paths. Not so much a tourist spot as a quiet place to wander or eat lunch when you want a break in the day.",
          "Walked through the garden while wandering around the old town streets and visited the green house. Enjoyed the variety of plants.",
          "Nice selection of plants and trees from all over the world. The plant from hot countrys are in greenhouses which invite for a stroll. The highlight for me was the indoor pond with all kind of lillys.",
          "Our docent did a two hour tour and covered a lot of ground. Three green houses, and most the grounds. It\u2019s free and is used in study by the university. Big redwood seemed out of place but was nice.",
          "Adjacent to Spalentor, the Botanic garden is open to the public (except at night) and is free. The big greenhouse is currently closed for renovation, but three smaller greenhouses and many small and big exotic plants are well worth a visit.",
          "Not far from city centre there is not big botanic garden but there are many interesting species and it is free of charge.",
          "Had a fantastic hour going through this garden which featured greenhouses with different climatic zones. Not a big garden like the one in Geneva but very nice to walk through especially in summer. Lovely placed benches where you can have a seat and day dream.",
          "My Honey Bee and me were in Basel in June; we had wandered around and found the Spalentor. As we searched for a WC we stumbled into a Botanical garden; the young lady in charge was helping some others and she waived at us. We found the WC and strolled into a tropical",
          "The gardens are not huge. But they are quiet and very nice. There are a couple paths and benches to picnic on. There is a nice little pond. It\u2019s a nice place.",
          "The beginning of spring is always a great time to visit a botanical garden.I visited on a sunny day, enjoyed sitting on a bench under a beautiful hangibg tree, went into the tropical and cactus houses. All if this for free.",
          "In a nice part of the city, near Spalentor, would of course be more interesting at other times of year but the tropical houses were pleasant to walk round with orchids, pond plants etc.",
          "These gardens are gorgeous. There are hundreds of rare plants and it is so wonderful to just sit on the benches and take in the oxygen! From the entrance we took it looks like it is very small, but we kept exploring and found a path to the larger section of the gardens. Don't",
          "An interesting little spot, out of the way from the main town. Some interesting specimens and well laid out. And free!",
          "While on vacation for a few days in Basel, Switzerland, we visited the Botanical Gardens. It is located on the university campus and it was an easy tram and walk from our hotel to get there. There are several greenhouses, one topical and another a pond setting. I liked the",
          "This botanical garden in the University of Basel is really lovely, with lots of different and interesting plants, spiral staircases which allow you to see the gardens from up high, rooms for all different climates, and natural wildlife roaming around, such as birds and insects.",
          "This is a nice little garden spot near the University. It has a great collection of plants, mostly Europe and the Middle East. It is laid out in a nice little pattern that will move you through many of the climate zones. Take the time to sit and admire as you wander the city.",
          "I normally love to visit botanical gardens. This was an exception. It seemed wild and very overgrown without being tended to in the normal manner. It is quite small, which in this case was a good thing. It\u2019s a pity that a bit more care hasn\u2019t been given to what could be a",
          "A fascinating collection of plants, individually at their best at any time of the year, but as a whole, making a wonderful garden collection. You can send many hours strolling around the various plots and greenhouses to admire the many different species on view.",
          "We stayed nearby and went here as a quiet calm after first arriving in Basel. Even though it is small, they had lovely collections, plus it was free. The best surprise was in the tropical greenhouse, because there were several varieties of tropical birds flying around.",
          "This is a beautiful garden with greenhouses, ponds, and a wonderful collection of flowers and plants. The grounds are well maintained and there are benches to sit and relax in the sun or shade. The tropical greenhouse has a wonderful variety of flowering plants and there are",
          "We walked through the inside and outside gardens. Nice walk from old town to the gardens as well. Many varieties of plants. No cost to visit.",
          "We visited on a hot saturday and found the garden well maintained and very pleasant to wonder around in. The glass houses are beautiful and house interesting collections of plants. The garden has plenty of shady spots. Free of charge.",
          "We didnt expect much when we decided to visit but at the end, this was a highlight of our trip in Basel. The botanical garden consists of many parts, it is very interesting and ... it is free. We spent approximately two hours and they totally worth it. Dont miss it.",
          "This was my second trip here, the first being in winter and now lots of plants had sprung to life this time with splashes of colour everywhere. It's a lovely, restful place to spend an hour or so wandering around and soaking up the nature here. It's free too which is a bonus!",
          "This botanic garden is not very huge but there are plenty of exotic and uncommon plants and trees. Entry is free",
          "In February we enjoyed the warm glass houses, the lush green and varied plants. Not very big, but a nice free (!!) thing to do on a cold afternoon",
          "It was January when we visited so there was very little to view in the garden itself. One greenhouse we came across had a good selection of plants which any gardener would find interesting. The tropical house had plenty of plants and a pond with fish. It was difficult to see any",
          "The botanical garden was a great surprise for us. We made some rounds until we found it, but managed in the end. You need to cross the Petersplaz green area (park) or take a right from the Spalentor. You can enter each greenhouse(kalthaus) and find another world. And on top of",
          "We visited Basel in the end of January, but the Botanical garden on our list, as I read it's free entrance and the hot houses are still nice in the winter time. It was a little bit hard to find, we went around a little bit until we reached the entrance. The garden itself wasn't",
          "The Botanic Garden is a good place to visit. Here we have found plants that we were not expecting!!!",
          "As you would expect the best part of this site in winter is the hot house. With lots of exhibits growing really well and some colourful plants, it was a welcome contrast to the grey world outside. The best parts were the beautiful tropical birds happily flying around and",
          "Although it is a small botanical garden in comparison to other cities, it is very well kept and has free lockers and space to leave jackets (and this is important because it is very hot inside the greenhouses). The highlight: the tropical greenhouse (main one) which has species",
          "My hotel was across the street. As I do wherever I am, I quickly unpack and hit the streets. Exploring your immediate locale makes my trips much more interesting, less intimidating and gets me in the mood to explore. I stumbled on these gardens and just quietly walked in not",
          "A cute little garden to wander about with some glass houses. The tropical one was great with ponds, beautiful birds and even a tiny elevated viewing platform.",
          "The botanical gardens was somewhere we thought would be worth a visit, it was but not as good as our expectations! There is an air of tiredness but also an underlying charm! On a sunny Saturday morning it was worth the time getting there, on another dull day probably not worth",
          "In this wonderful garden you have the opportunity to enjoy a moment of peace sitting on one of the confi benches or strawl through a rain forest.",
          "interesting place. not a commercial place at all, just a place in the middle of the city where one can step away from the hustle and bustle and enjoy some nice green space. the cat roaming the grounds was a highlight. we had reviewed this place online prior to our visit.",
          "I like to come here on the weekends. It is free, has a few really nice green houses. A big one with a jungle and animals and a few others - one housing the beautiful Victoria water lily.",
          "Whilst this garden may not be the biggest botanical garden I've ever visited it was never the less very enjoyable, especially the areas where wildlife is encouraged.",
          "The botanic garden has surprisingly a lot of samples of plants from all over the World. The big rain forest part is a must see on its own. The rest of the garden is quite good as well. And you can grab something to eat or drink or something to read and enjoy some relaxing",
          "Worth visiting , several greenhouses with nice selection of plants , nice on a cold day and free admission . Easy to access from spalentor tram stop",
          "very interesting the whole history of the chocolate. You can also taste it. Unfortunately, we were there the night of museum night and too many people. We wait 1 hour outside. A place to visit.",
          "It's a huge, incredibly detailed attraction. Multiple greenhouse stuffed to the roof with plants. If you're into gardening then it's even more a must see!",
          "The botanical garden was a nice place to visit even on a snowy January day. The greenhouses provided a nice warm respite from the cold outside. Plants from all over the globe were represented. My young children (ages 4 and 2) enjoyed the tropical greenhouse which even housed",
          "Worth visiting if you like plants. It is a small garden, but full with nice and different exotical plants.",
          "Exemplifies Swiss attention to detail and quality. Well presented specimens sensibly arranged. A romantic and a botanic experience.",
          "Interesting set of greenhouses. Nothing written in English but did not detract from the experience. No entrance fee, donations welcomed.",
          "This place blew me away, ten yards from our wonderful hotel the U of B has a greenhouse and garden area that was amazing.OMG the things and research they do is top flight",
          "It's a beautiful place with many species from all around the world. The highlight is the Tropenhaus, with several tropical plants and awesome birds flying around (it's better to go in cold days because it's very warm and humid inside!). The plants are all with identification",
          "This is a fantastic place to visit. We discovered it by accident when we were doing one of the Basel walks. There are loads of interesting and enormous tropical plants to view. In fact it is almost like being in a tropical rain forest - every now and then the air is sprayed with",
          "Found this place by chance whilst wandering in the city. Lovely calm and cool place on a hot summers days. Lots of hot houses to visit, old and new. All week kept and clearly labeled.",
          "A huge collection of plants from all over the world. Free entrance. Audioguide! Don't Forget the camera. Situated near the University and the old City.",
          "Located near one of the old city gate, the tropical hot house within the gardens is really worth a visit. Lots of exotic plants from all around the world.",
          "When it's nice and warm weather, the outdoor rock gardens and the ponds, surrounded with big old shadow-giving trees, give you the opportunity to relax on a bench in the middle of the city. In the winter (or cold / rainy days), the main attraction is the tropical greenhouse",
          "We tripped from Barr in France to Basel and sopped in here after I head some reviews. It was as most had said... Nice layout to be able to wander through the garden with all the different plants named, then through the differing glass houses with their differing climate plants,",
          "Basel's botanical garden is in fact rather small, but does feel larger due to its sophisticated layout. Even if you're not that interested in botany, it's a very pleasant place to relax, maybe read a book on a bench - it's right next to the university library!",
          "An unexpected pleasure in the City of Basel. After walking around on a Monday, when museums were closed, we happened upon the free University botanical garden. Lovely tropical plants, greenhouses, ponds, benches for relaxing. An understated oasis.",
          "Very quiet and a nice break to see something a bit different. Loved he big lily pads and the quick tour of the rainforest. We went on a Monday and it was very very quiet. I'd recommend if you have a spare half hour or so",
          "I can recommend the botanical garden to everyone who likes flowers. The rainforest glass house brings you the feeling of standing in the middle of a rainforest f.e. in madagascar! I enjoyed each glas house, also the outer area is well planned, offering many relaxing areas.",
          "The botanic garden is a very nice place to spend some time. Free entrance! Outdoors as well as indoors there are many plants to see and admire. I also saw some small lizards having a good time in the sun. The only thing I missed was a cafeteria, I would have liked to sit on one",
          "Handily located right next to the Spalentor, they're easy to find. We enjoyed looking around the glasshouses. Beware that although in summer months the gardens are open until 6pm, the glasshouses except the Victoria-Haus close at 5pm. Great free attraction.",
          "As a serious botanical garden visitor, I had high expectations for these gardens based on other travelers' reviews. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Parts of the grounds were not open. Other parts seemed to need attention. I was there on Saturday morning (it was open),",
          "When you walk in the first door, be sure to check out the catepillar exhibit if it is still there. I spent a few minutes just watching how much these citters could eat in very little time. Once you walk into the main greenhouse the humidity hits you right in the face, but",
          "Botanischer Garten der Universit\u00e4t is near (almost next to the old city) and we can relax with the tropical trees in the warm greenhouse.",
          "The gardens were opposite our hotel so I popped in one sunny afternoon for a visit. The hot-house was a real treat, with small tropical birds calling out and swooping between the lush greenery. There are glass houses filled with cactii and another devoted to water-loving",
          "Nothing much but worth the visit. All specimens were carefully labeled, and things are very tidy. I would recommend a stroll.",
          "A mini \"Kew Gardens\" in the heart of Basel... next to the Spalentor impressive medieval gate , and close to a nice park where you can relax and have a picnic. Visit the different green houses, try to spot the turtlesm frogs and exotic birds in the tropical forest ! It's free and",
          "A lovely and quiet garden in the middle of Basel. Special rare plants from all over the world. In the big greenhouse there are rare birds and reptiles also.",
          "Every trip to Basel we visit the Botanical Gardens. The outside gardens offer a delightful stroll though a unique variety of plants, including sequoia trees. However the variety of plants in the hot houses are perhaps the most impressive. Separate houses showcase a multitude",
          "The tropical house with a cast-iron staicase to the top of jungle-type trees with tropical birds flying there - fabulous. Bring a book and enjoy the heat!"

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany. As of 2016, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018). The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007. Basel is the most densely populated city in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBasel has an area, as of 2009, of 23.91 square kilometers (9.23 sq mi). Of this area, 0.95 km2 (0.37 sq mi) or 4.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.88 km2 (0.34 sq mi) or 3.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.67 km2 (7.98 sq mi) or 86.4% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.45 km2 (0.56 sq mi) or 6.1% is either rivers or lakes.Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 10.2% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 40.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 24.0%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.7% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 8.9%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 2.5% is used for growing crops and 1.3% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen system, Basel features a continental-influenced oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), due to its relatively far inland position. The city averages 120.4 days of rain or snow annually and on average receives 842 mm (33.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Basel receives an average of 99 mm (3.9 in) of rain. The month with the most days of precipitation is also May, with an average of 12.4 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 45 mm (1.8 in) of precipitation over 8.4 days.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThe city of Basel functions as the capital of the Swiss half-canton of Basel-Stadt, though several of its suburbs are located in the half-canton of Basel-Landschaft or the canton of Aargau. Others are even located in France and Germany.\n\n\n=== Canton ===\nThe canton Basel-Stadt consists of three municipalities: Riehen, Bettingen, and the city Basel itself. The political structure and agencies of the city and the canton are identical.\n\n\n=== City ===\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nThe city itself has 19 quarters:\n\nGrossbasel (Greater Basel):\nKleinbasel (Lesser Basel):\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is In Silber ein schwarzer Baselstab. (Argent, a staff of Basel sable)\n(For \"staff\", see Heraldsnet website.)\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe canton's executive, the Executive Council (Regierungsrat), consists of seven members for a mandate period of 4 years. They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority. The president (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election, while the heads of the other departments are appointed by the collegiate. The current president is Dr Guy Morin. The executive body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (German: Rathaus) on the central Marktplatz. The building was built in 1504\u201314.\nAs of 2016, Basel's Executive Council is made up of three representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party), and one member each of Green Alliance of Basel (GB) (who is the president), FDP (Free Democratic Party), LDP (Liberal-Demokratische Partei of Basel), and CVP (Christian Democratic Party), giving the left parties a combined four out of seven seats. The last election was held on 23 October and 27 November 2016.\n\nBarbara Sch\u00fcpbach-Guggenb\u00fchlis is State Chronicler (Staatsschreiberin) since 2009, and Marco Greiner is Head of Communication (Regierungssprecher) and Vice State Chronicler (Vizestaatsschreiber) since 2007 for the Executive Council.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe parliament, the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt (Grosser Rat), consists of 100 seats, with members (called in German: Grossrat/Grossr\u00e4tin) elected every 4 years. The sessions of the Grand Council are public. Unlike the members of the Executive Council, the members of the Grand Council are not politicians by profession, but they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020. The legislative body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (Rathaus).\nThe last election was held on 23 October 2016 for the mandate period (Legislatur) of 2017\u20132021. As of 1 February 2017, the Grand Council consist of 35 members of the Social Democratic Party (SP), 15 members of the Swiss People's Party (SVP), 13 Gr\u00fcnes B\u00fcndnis (GB) (a collaboration of the Green Party (GPS), its junior party, and Basels starke Alternative (BastA!)), 15 Liberal-Demokratische Partei (LDP) and its junior party, 10 The Liberals (FDP) and its junior party, the representative of the Aktive Bettingen (AB) is associated to the parliamentary group (Fraktion) of the FDP, 8 (7/1) Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP)/Evangelical People's Party (EVP), and 3 Green Liberal Party (GLP).The left parties missed an absolute majority by two seats.\n\n\n=== Federal elections ===\n\n\n==== National Council ====\nIn the 2019 federal election the most popular party was the Social Democratic Party (SP) which received two seats with 34% (\u22121) of the votes. The next five most popular parties were the Green Party (GPS) (19.4%, +7.3), the LPS (14.5%, +3.6) and the FDP (5.8, \u22123.5), which are chained together at 20.3%, (+0.1), the SVP (11.3%, ), and the Green Liberal Party (GLP) (5%, +0.6), CVP (4.1%, -1.9). In the federal election, a total of 44,628 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 49.4%.On 18 October 2015, in the federal election the most popular party was the Social Democratic Party (SP) which received two seats with 35% of the votes. The next three most popular parties were the FDP (20.2%), the SVP (16.8%), and the Green Party (GPS) (12.2%), each with one seat. In the federal election, a total of 57,304 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 50.4%.\n\n\n==== Council of States ====\nOn 20 October 2019, in the federal election Eva Herzog, member of the Social Democratic Party      (SP), was elected for the first time as a State Councillor (St\u00e4nder\u00e4tin) in the first round as single representative of the canton of Basel-Town and successor of Anita Fetz in the national Council of States (St\u00e4nderat) with an absolute majority of 37'210 votes.On 18 October 2015, in the federal election State Councillor (German: St\u00e4nder\u00e4tin) Anita Fetz, member of the Social Democratic Party       (SP), was re-elected in the first round as single representative of the canton of Basel-Town in the national Council of States (St\u00e4nderat) with an absolute majority of 35'842 votes. She has been a member of it since 2003.\n\n\n=== International relations ===\n\n\n==== Twin towns and sister cities ====\nBasel has two sister cities and a twinning among two states:\n Shanghai, China, since 2007\n US State Massachusetts, since 2002\n Miami Beach, US, since 2011\n\n\n==== Partner cities ====\n Rotterdam, Netherlands, since 1945\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nBasel has a population (as of August 2019) of 177,654.  As of 2015, 35.5% of the population are resident foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years (1999\u20132009 ) the population has changed at a rate of \u22120.3%. It has changed at a rate of 3.2% due to migration and at a rate of \u22123% due to births and deaths.Of the population in the municipality 58,560 or about 35.2% were born in Basel and lived there in 2000. There were 1,396 or 0.8% who were born in the same canton, while 44,874 or 26.9% were born somewhere else in Switzerland, and 53,774 or 32.3% were born outside of Switzerland.In 2008 there were 898 live births to Swiss citizens and 621 births to non-Swiss citizens, and in same time span there were 1,732 deaths of Swiss citizens and 175 non-Swiss citizen deaths.

There were 70,517 married individuals, 12,435 widows or widowers and 13,104 individuals who are divorced.As of 2000 the average number of residents per living room was 0.59 which is about equal to the cantonal average of 0.58 per room. In this case, a room is defined as space of a housing unit of at least 4 m2 (43 sq ft) as normal bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens and habitable cellars and attics. About 10.5% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement).\nAs of 2000, there were 86,371 private households in the municipality, and an average of 1.8 persons per household. There were 44,469 households that consist of only one person and 2,842 households with five or more people.  Out of a total of 88,646 households that answered this question, 50.2% were households made up of just one person and there were 451 adults who lived with their parents.  Of the rest of the households, there are 20,472 married couples without children, 14,554 married couples with children There were 4,318 single parents with a child or children.

As of 2009, the construction rate of new housing units was 2.6 new units per 1000 residents.As of 2003 the average price to rent an average apartment in Basel was 1118.60 Swiss francs (CHF) per month (US$890, \u00a3500, \u20ac720 approx. exchange rate from 2003).  The average rate for a one-room apartment was 602.27 CHF (US$480, \u00a3270, \u20ac390), a two-room apartment was about 846.52 CHF (US$680, \u00a3380, \u20ac540), a three-room apartment was about 1054.14 CHF (US$840, \u00a3470, \u20ac670) and a six or more room apartment cost an average of 2185.24 CHF (US$1750, \u00a3980, \u20ac1400).  The average apartment price in Basel was 100.2% of the national average of 1116 CHF. The vacancy rate for the municipality, in 2010, was 0.74%.\n\n\n==== Historical population ====\n\n\n=== Language ===\nMost of the population (as of 2000) speaks German (129,592 or 77.8%), with Italian being second most common (9,049 or 5.4%) and French being third (4,280 or 2.6%). There are 202 persons who speak Romansh.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nFrom the 2000 census, 41,916 or 25.2% were Roman Catholic, while 39,180 or 23.5% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. Of the rest of the population, there were 4,567 members of an Orthodox church (or about 2.74% of the population), there were 459 individuals (or about 0.28% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 3,464 individuals (or about 2.08% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church.

There were 1,325 individuals (or about 0.80% of the population) who were Jewish, however only members of religious institutions are counted as such by the municipality, which makes the actual number of people of Jewish descent living in Basel considerably higher. There were 746 individuals who were Buddhist, 947 individuals who were Hindu and 485 individuals who belonged to another church. 52,321 (or about 31.41% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 8,780 individuals (or about 5.27% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nBasel is subdivided into 19 quarters (Quartiere). The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%. As of 2008, there were 18 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 9 businesses involved in this sector. 34,645 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,176 businesses in this sector. 120,130 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 8,908 businesses in this sector. There were 82,449 residents of the municipality who were employed in some capacity, of which females made up 46.2% of the workforce.\nIn 2008 the total number of full-time equivalent jobs was 130,988. The number of jobs in the primary sector was 13, of which 10 were in agriculture and 4 were in forestry or lumber production. The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 33,171 of which 24,848 or (74.9%) were in manufacturing, 10 were in mining and 7,313 (22.0%) were in construction. The number of jobs in the tertiary sector was 97,804. In the tertiary sector; 12,880 or 13.2% were in wholesale or retail sales or the repair of motor vehicles, 11,959 or 12.2% were in the movement and storage of goods, 6,120 or 6.3% were in a hotel or restaurant, 4,186 or 4.3% were in the information industry, 10,752 or 11.0% were the insurance or financial industry, 13,695 or 14.0% were technical professionals or scientists, 6,983 or 7.1% were in education and 16,060 or 16.4% were in health care.In 2000, there were 121,842 workers who commuted into the municipality and 19,263 workers who commuted away.

When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS.

The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

          "A wonderful collection and broad overview on the topic, both for families with children as for adults. Loved it!",
          "Well worth a visit to kill an hour when in town, good to see on a rainy day. Cheap, and 4 floors of interesting stuff to see............a woolly mammoth which is pretty cool, fossils and dino exhibits.........brought my son who enjoyed it. Some morons on here complaining that",
          "This museums certainly worth a visit as the exhibits are really well displayed. The only downside is the fact is that all the information is in German which makes it somewhat limiting for english speaking visitors. The museum had the wildlife photographer of the year exhibition",
          "This museum is a perfect stay with family and friends. The standard exhibition is already rich with so many details and well explained. In addition they propose well made special events like the \"wildlife photographer of the year\" that are simply amazing",
          "The current exhibition is the wildlife photograph of the year competition. There are some superb photos. We enjoyed the rest of the museum. Take the free audioguide in English, delivered in idiomatic English and lively presentation.",
          "We visited Basel on a rainy day so this place was ideal for a visit. It has great and interesting displays of all kinds of animals and insects, including a huge Mammoth and my grandchildren and I really enjoyed our visit. You need to pay to get in.",
          "The reason aof my trip to Basel was a congress taking place in the Natural History Museum, so as a guest I had of course the chance to visit the exhibitions. Really interesting. There are lovely details as much as impressive models (e.g. a live size mammoth, giraffe...).",
          "I moved through the museum pretty quickly because there isn\u2019t much in English which was an issue for me. It\u2019s nice but I didn\u2019t see anything that I couldn\u2019t see in a museum in the US and be able to read about.",
          "This absolutely brilliant museum sits on the most beautiful street and old town area of Basel, 2-3 minutes from the Basel M\u00fcnster (the cathedral). The entrance is so understated that you might miss it were it not for the wee human skeleton with sunglasses at its door! I went",
          "I love going to museums but this had to be my least favourite... only a handful of exhibitions have an English translation to them. Personally didn\u2019t feel like it was worth the money. Also the staff pick and choose who pays for entry..an American family walked in before us and",
          "We also did this on Easter Sunday and it was well worth the time. It have many exhibits the children can experiment with. Children will be entertained as well as educated. Lots of things to see and do.",
          "We were not expecting something that nice at such a decent price to be honest. There\u2019s plenty of interesting stuff in this small museum, from Dinosaurs to insects, from animals to the human evolution. Very well presented in very well-kept premises, it is ideal if you want to",
          "Easy to find near Munster but lots of steps in the museum itself. Useful map and phone guide in English. Not a welcoming place from the staff. Enjoyed the ant colony, fossils and taxidermy. Lots of walking for not many exhibits, not a very good NH museum compared to others but",
          "The Naturhistorisches Museum Basel has some really interesting exhibits that are aimed at all age groups from the young to the old. Although most of the displays were in German we still enjoyed our time there and would recommend it to anyone. The virtual reality game looked",
          "Have visited a couple of these now, and Basels is average. Fair size spread over a few floors and some interesting exhibits. Difficult to find cafe ( didn't find it) and find your way around They accepted our Basel card giving us 50% reduction without a problem",
          "Good localizationVery. Very nice and interesing place. Good for children. Remember to use your discount ticket for 50% \ud83d\ude0a",
          "This is a wonderful museum of natural history. Some of the fossils are just stunning, and the leaf cutter ant colony should not be missed. The butterfly collection is beautiful. The exhibits are well maintained, as is the entire building. It was not too busy when we were there,",
          "I love this museum, it is great for a rainy day activity. I visit often and really enjoy the photography special exhibits. They have a huge room dedicated to insects, butterflies, sea shells and crabs which I find really cool. They have a great geology exhibition which also",
          "This modern hotel is very well organized with interesting exhibitions. The wildlife fotos were absolutely fantastic",
          "The museum is nice, with live sized statues , award winning photographs and a painted room. The painted room is amazing that you can see the full images only when u view it at the correct angle, you have to stand at the foot mark.",
          "We (3 parties) visited with 8 children and 6 adults and there was something for everyone. Its big enough but not huge. The exhibition of wildlife photographs was a highlight. Nice picnic area. Can thoroughly recommend!",
          "My husband and I chanced upon this interesting museum on a Saturday morning as we were walking up the hill to the cathedral. Perhaps it had not been open when we had passed previously, but we had no idea it was there and, from the street, in spite of its splendid front doors,",
          "Just like any nature museum with a lot of stuffed animals. But I must say it is very tourist friendly. The have a very good multi language audio guide to guide u along with quite a lot of exhibits",
          "This museum is a great way to spend a family weekend. The exhibition was created in a child-friendly way. The animals look real while the information presented is easy to memorise thanks to fun and learn style. Adults can learn new things just as much as children.",
          "have 1 or 2 special exhibits in addition to their permanent exhibits. When I visited had one small but well curated exhibit on the extinction of animals now as well as the past. Had a very large exhibit on mummies from around the world and across cultures and places of",
          "It is situated in an old building and is spread in various rooms chambers and floors. Very nice exbition, especially for the Children. The mummies exhibition was intriguing. Family and baby friendly too.. Calculate about 25 euros and 2-3 hours depending on your pace and stamina.",
          "As part of the museums night (pay one entrance fee and access that night almost all museums of Baesl) I went to explore this place. What a gem !! For over an hour I was wandering from one exhibit to another. Mummies, Dinosaurs and other animals on display. Beautiful experiance",
          "7 euro for two adults. Not including special exhibits I am a big fan of National History so was keen to visit Basel\u2019s and explore. I suppose it was too much to ask that there would be information boards in English (after all this Is Switzerland) but no audio guides either! We",
          "We went specifically for the 'Mumien' (mummified) Exhibition which was great, but found the rest of the exhibits to be really interesting too. If you are appreciate taxidermy, you will love it",
          "The museum is quite spectacular on the outside but not sure it is the most exciting museum one can visit in Basel. It is a nice activity with the kids but the collection was not that exciting for us, compared to other museums of natural history around Europe.",
          "We went to the museum at first for the mummification exhibit but also spent time in the other parts. It was great and we really enjoyed it. The only downside was the lack of information in other language than German. They really should make an effort to translate the",
          "It's a very interesting museum, that lacks information in other language than german. I could have taken a better experience if I could be able to understand better what I was seeing.",
          "A very good little museum, we enjoyed the dinosaurs and seeing the different extinct species in stuffed animasl, especially the woolly mammoth. We were sorry nothing at all was written in English and we weren't offered anything to help us understand, may be I should have asked",
          "I spent the majority of my time there in the special exhibit on mummification, both purposeful and by chance. The baby mammoth really caught my attention. Although I did not check out evert other exhibit area, it appeared to be a quality museum.",
          "We loved it! It's small, but is done very nicely. There are some very unique things and is very interactive for kids. My two young children loved it. I also must add that they have made it very convenient, with ample stools for people to sit.",
          "Me and my girlfriend really enjoyed the museum. It had a really big display of many animals who all looked superb. It was almost asif they could move at any second! Only note is that all the signs were in German. But i do believe you could rent an tables with english information",
          "not expensive and not big. still found things i had not seen before and to keep me happy for an hour or so. kids were obviously enjoying the dinosaurs :)",
          "You must visit this museum when in Basel. Probably the best exhibition of historic animal life over the centuries that I have ever seen. Fascinating to look at and read about all things associated with Natural History. And a bonus free entry because it was a Public Holiday. My",
          "Only takes about 2 hours and is free of charge with some impressive pieces. I went on a Wednesday morning & I basically had the museum to myself! The only negative is the lack of any English translations.",
          "Nothing to complain about the exposition itself, much appreciated - many interesting natural evidences and recreations for people who (like me) love nature and are eager to know more about the history of our world and life. However, I found very disappointing the lack of English",
          "Good exhibits and very interesting. More difficult for me as its not in English! But don't let that put you off. I loved it. Much more interesting than I expected. A good way to spend a couple of hours and nicely situated in the city centre.",
          "We found this museum in Bern but it was the last activity in our agenda as we were trying to kill some time in the day. Unfortunately we are not fans of Art nor museums. We paid 7 Swiss francs each but spent about an hour and a half walking through 3 floors of natural history.",
          "It is a pretty walk up from Shifflande, and the exhibitions and historical costumes/weapons/artifacts/bones are all quite cool. Great way to pass time on a sunday, especially with kids.",
          "Natural History museums tend to have a great collection and are kid friendly This place is no exception. You can touch and interact with a lot of the collection. Today was a slightly rainy day making this day a popular day for a lot of small kids. If noisy (although",

          "It was free and took a couple of hours to go around, which is about all younger children can manage. Had a breadth of things but nothing too in-depth. No English translations but not a massive problem.",
          "It has nice collections which are fascinating for children. Free entrance under age of 13, which is great. Unfortunately it does not provide a map with the collections and everything is in German, however many things are self explanatory and children love to explore themselves.",
          "I was in a bad mood when I entered this museum (nothing to do with the museum itself). So I went in and the price was only eight francs, but just before I paid, an older woman reminded the rookie ticket taker that I had come after four o\u2019clock - it was free! Well if I\u2019m not",
          "Free to enter, ok to view but no English translations of the exhibits was a bit disappointing. Some interesting things to see. Worth a visit if you need to kill a couple of hours.",
          "I went there accidentally when I explored the city on foot. There are lots of insects even has got a real beehive on the 1st floor to show you real bees working and living. :-)",
          "Comprehensive museum with a wide range of exhibits from dinosaurs to a large mammoth, butterflies, live ant and bee colonies, geology, marine animals etc. Lockers are available to store bags and there is a well stocked shop. Entry price is reasonable for Switzerland. The only",
          "in a beautiful old building going up to the muensterplatz. it is even more interesting for children as they can see animals which are extinct. we enjoyed the various stones and fossils. great 3 hours spent there. leave the belongings in a locker, you need a 2 franc piece. there",
          "we stumbled on a free day at this museum, and decided to try it mostly because everything else was closed early on a sunday morning. all of the exhibits were written up in german only, which we don't read. but that didn't take away from the experience (and maybe even added to",
          "We were very surprised by this museum. What a stunning collection of animals past and present! Beautiful displays and around every turn we were surprised. The dinosaurs are amazing, but also modern day animals are on display. Then in another room a history of the earth.",
          "From live animals to models of extinct ones this museum has a lot to offer and at a good price. Although signs and information is in German, the exhibits are easy to follow.",
          "In this museum you can feel that you live in ace ages. A worthwhile visit and without fee in the main part of museum.",
          "One of the places I've spent a lot of time as a child. This museum boosts many nice exhibits like stuffed animals and dinosaur models. The architecture of the place is quite nice and it is the perfect place to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon. The closeby \"museum of the cultures\""

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany. As of 2016, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018). The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007. Basel is the most densely populated city in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBasel has an area, as of 2009, of 23.91 square kilometers (9.23 sq mi). Of this area, 0.95 km2 (0.37 sq mi) or 4.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.88 km2 (0.34 sq mi) or 3.7% is forested.

Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.7% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 8.9%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 2.5% is used for growing crops and 1.3% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen system, Basel features a continental-influenced oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), due to its relatively far inland position. The city averages 120.4 days of rain or snow annually and on average receives 842 mm (33.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Basel receives an average of 99 mm (3.9 in) of rain. The month with the most days of precipitation is also May, with an average of 12.4 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 45 mm (1.8 in) of precipitation over 8.4 days.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThe city of Basel functions as the capital of the Swiss half-canton of Basel-Stadt, though several of its suburbs are located in the half-canton of Basel-Landschaft or the canton of Aargau.

They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority. The president (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election, while the heads of the other departments are appointed by the collegiate. The current president is Dr Guy Morin. The executive body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (German: Rathaus) on the central Marktplatz.

Unlike the members of the Executive Council, the members of the Grand Council are not politicians by profession, but they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020. The legislative body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (Rathaus).\nThe last election was held on 23 October 2016 for the mandate period (Legislatur) of 2017\u20132021.

The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%.

Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel.

Live marketing company and fair organizer MCH Group has its head office in Basel.\n\nThe carnival of the city of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (Morgestraich) on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\nBasel Tattoo, founded in 2006 by the local Top Secret Drum Corps, has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the Edinburgh Military Tattoo.

These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The football club FC Basel continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the 2008 European Championships, as well as Geneva, Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The championships were jointly hosted by Switzerland and Austria. BSC Old Boys and Concordia Basel are the other football teams in Basel.\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is ice hockey.

        "wiki": "The Pharmacy Museum of the University of Basel (Pharmaziemuseum der Universit\u00e4t Basel, formerly Pharmazie-Historisches Museum der Universit\u00e4t Basel, originally Sammlung f\u00fcr das historische Apothekenwesen) shows in its permanent collection the history of remedies and their fabrication. Designed as a collection of evidences and for studies, the museum has been founded in 1924 by Josef Anton H\u00e4fliger (1873\u20131954) and has been preserved until this day in its original form as a 'scientific cabinet'.\nThe museum is one of the largest and most significant collections of pharmaceutical objects and the history of pharmacy. It contains pharmaceutical ceramics, complete furniture of historical pharmacies, an alchemical laboratory, mortars, historical first aid kits, books, medications used in the past, and everything that has to do with the fabrication of remedies.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe house \u00bbZum Vorderen Sessel\u00ab, where the museum is situated, is located in the historic city centre of Basel, half way between the market square and St Peter's Church. It has first been mentioned in 1316 as bath house \u00bbUnter Kr\u00e4mern\u00ab and has always been a location of changeful history. From 1480, famous letterpress printer Johannes Amerbach lived there; he was the ancestor of the famous academic Amerbach family. In 1507, the house had been inherited by Johannes Frobenius, probably the most famous letterpress printer of his time. Erasmus von Rotterdam himself, being Froben's guest from 1514 until 1516, lived and worked there.\nThe letterpress printers were joined by famous illustrators, such as Hans Holbein the Younger and his brother Ambrosius, and the engraver Urs Graf. In 1526 and 1527, the famous physician and alchemist Theophrastus von Hohenheim, who named himself Paracelsus, worked there; he had just moved to Basel and was Froben's family doctor.\n\nSince 1925, the house \u00bbZum Sessel\u00ab hosts the Pharmacy Museum of the University of Basel. The aim of the museum is to show the history of pharmacy in its aspects of science, art history and ethnology.\n\n\n== Founder and Curators ==\n1924: Josef Anton H\u00e4fliger (Founder)\n1942\u20131972: Alfons Lutz\n1972\u20131979: Lydia Mez-Mangold\n1979\u20131986: Laurentia Leon\n1986\u20132018: Michael Kessler\nDirector since January 2020: Philippe Wanner (2018\u20132020 curator a. i.)\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe Pharmacy Museum dates back to a time when collecting of objects had still been an essential element of scientific teaching and research. It has its origins in the private collection of pharmacist and lector for practical pharmacy and history of pharmacy Josef Anton H\u00e4fliger (1873\u20131954). In 1924, he donated his collection of ancient apothecary vessels, obsolete drugs, prescriptions, woodcarvings, paintings and books to the University of Basel. Heinrich Z\u00f6rnig, director of the 'Pharmazeutische Anstalt' (Department of Pharmacy) founded in 1917, provided several rooms to host the collection. Establishing the collection in the Department of Pharmacy, H\u00e4fliger was able to provide his students an approach to pharmaceutical practices across the historical process. Objects were used as teaching material for the intermediation of the history of pharmacy and the techniques of fabrication of remedies. The collection arised in direct connection with the historical development of pharmaceutical practice, hence in the first half of the 20th century the whole pharmaceutical sector - from research and production until the selling of remedies - was undergoing a profound transformation.\n\n\n== Exhibition ==\n\n\n=== Remedies, drugs and medications ===\n\nVarious aspects of diseases and illnesses, as well as various concepts of healing, are exemplified by a considerable collection of drugs and medications from all over the world.\n\n\n=== Laboratories ===\nAmong the two historical laboratories in the collection, the alchemical laboratory with original exhibits from the 16th and 17th century is an evidence for the retrieval of the philosopher's stone. The pharmaceutical laboratory dating from the time around 1800 is designed for the manual preparation of medical plants.\n\n\n=== Antique pharmacy interiors ===\nThree antique pharmacy interiors illustrate the history of pharmacy through the ages: The luxuriantly decorated \u00bbHofapotheke\u00ab (Court Pharmacy) from Innsbruck dates back to 1755. The pharmacy of the years around 1820 is designed in the classical style of the Empire. The transition to the era of industrialism is shown in the furniture of the former Basel \u00bbBarf\u00fcsser-Apotheke\u00ab (Barf\u00fcsser Pharmacy), designed just shortly before 1900. Nowadays it is placed in the entrance area of the museum and is therefore the furniture of the museum shop.\n\n\n=== Faience ===\n\nThe museum shows a prominent collection of pharmaceutical pottery. The so-called Faience have been used as containers for basic materials and remedies in pharmacies since the 15th century.\n\n\n== Research ==\nThe Pharmacy Museum, as one of the two University Museums of Basel, is actively engaged in scientific research and teaching. There are courses in history of pharmacy, history of natural sciences and life sciences on a regular basis. Furthermore, the Pharmacy Museum promotes the scientific exploration of the history of pharmacy as well as research based on objects and collection.\n\n\n== Library ==\nThe Pharmacy Museum is the home of a scientific library, containing literature and information about pharmacy, about its related sciences and about its history. Moreover, it contains material whose collection had not been originally intended, such as drug compendiums, advertising brochures, price and tariff lists and so forth). Books and goods from the library can not be lent out, they have to be viewed and used on location. The use of the library is free of charge. The inventory is retrievable over the Swissbib catalogue:\n/ Swissbib Katalog\n\n\n== Museum Shop \u2013 Shopping like one hundred years ago ==\n\nThe museum shop is arranged in the historical furniture of the former \u00bbBarf\u00fcsser-Apotheke\u00ab. It provides home-made tea creations, herbs, candies, pharmaceutical glass ware, soaps and souvenirs. The entrance to the museum shop is free of charge.\n\n\n== Opening hours, Tickets and guided tours ==\nThe museum is open from Tuesday until Sunday, 10am - 17pm. On Mondays and public holidays, the museum remains closed.\nThe ticket for the museum is also valid in the Museum of Anatomy of the University of Basel on the same or the following day. Staff and students of the University of Basel have free admission to both museums.\nOn the first sunday of every month at 2pm, there is a public guided tour through the museum.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMuseums in Basel\n\n\n== External links ==\nPharmaziemuseum der Universit\u00e4t Basel - official website\nBasel museums website Media related to Pharmazie-Historisches Museum, Basel at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Not easy to find but in a nice little area in Basel. A bit on the old fashioned side, it serves a dusty niche in the story of pharmacy in a town of large drug companies, so it's very apropo it's located here. Nice to visit...once. Not a lot of rotating exhibits as it is small",

          "We went to the museum with an organized group. Maybe it's because I like science but i really liked it. The guide introduce us to the old methods of curing people and to the history of the pharmacy. The museum has a lot of objects inside, some very peculiar and strange. It's",
          "There is nothing to dislike about this small but interesting museum. I was with a friend who was studying to be a pharmacist so we really enjoyed looking at the ways things were done in the past.",

          "We experienced a very educating and entertaining visit at the museum. This was an event for a private party and the guide very much focused on our interests and professional questions. All the exhibits are very well maintained in a historic building. Absolutely worth a visit",

          "It's an interesting museum in a historic place of Basel. It's quite small but is filled with many things. From all elements to old medicine (such as scorpions, snake venom and lots of strange things). The book of Vesal is displayed as well. The one thing that makes it really",
          "The pharma museum is a small and interesting place with a variety of objects, from superstitious objects to the first medical tools and microscoped and terminating with a reconstruction of a chemist's workshop. They also organise guided tours in German and English upon request.",
          "This is a nicely curated self-guided museum in central Basel that will be popular with anyone who is interested in pharmacy or medicine. The exhibits are nicely laid our but as others have said, the written information is almost entirely in German. The audioguide is available in",
          "This is an interesting museum without many tourists. There is not much information displayed in English, so if that's an issue I recommend the audio guide. The audio guide could have been more succinct, but despite it being too wordy it was still helpful to provide background in",
          "A friend was visiting me and we were trying to find unusual things to do - so we thought we'd give this a go. If you're the kind of person who doesn't mind just going through and going 'that is so interesting' without narrative to help, this is an amazing museum filled with lots",
          "This place has very many interesting items on display. However, they lack the funds to really display them professionally. People were most eager to be helpful",

          "This gem of a museum is tucked away behind a locked door which was opened just as we passed, or we might have missed it. Two floors of displays have been prepared meticulously, with labels in German. Fortunately, for four Swiss francs, we had hired a headset which gave",
          "Wow, what a collection. I am not really interested in pharma, but this museum has such a rich collection of pharma-\"things\", you nearly can't believe what you see.Well done chronologically as well with two entire rebuilt pharmacies in the building. Great and unique stuff",

          "I have an interest in pharmacy so found the history and exhibit items very interesting. There are several floors with some displays behind glass cabinets and some rooms set up as they would have been in their time period. The herb garden outside is small but nicely labeled.",
          "if you can get there when they are open (the hours are limited) and you are interested in pharmacy/medical history, this is an interesting hour or so. Limited English language information but a stuffed crocodile and jars of ground-up mummies don't need a lot of explaining.",

          "Tucked into a small lane with the entry not too prominent is this gem in Basel. The museum shop is on the ground floor and one heads up to have a look at the whole place. It is far bigger than what appears from outside. There are collections of drugs, pharmacy equipments,"

        "wiki": "Jean Tinguely (22 May 1925 \u2013 30 August 1991) was a Swiss sculptor best known for his kinetic art sculptural machines (known officially as metamechanics) that extended the Dada tradition into the later part of the 20th century. Tinguely's art satirized automation and the technological overproduction of material goods.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBorn in Fribourg, Tinguely grew up in Basel, but moved to France in 1952 with his first wife, Swiss artist Eva Aeppli, to pursue a career in art. He belonged to the Parisian avantgarde in the mid-twentieth century and was one of the artists who signed the New Realist's manifesto (Nouveau r\u00e9alisme) in 1960.His best-known work, a self-destroying sculpture titled Homage to New York (1960), only partially self-destructed at the Museum of Modern Art, New York City, although his later work, Study for an End of the World No. 2 (1962), detonated successfully in front of an audience gathered in the desert outside Las Vegas.\nTinguely married fellow Swiss artist Eva Aeppli in 1951. In 1971, he married his second wife, Niki de Saint Phalle with whom he collaborated on several artistic projects, such as the Hon \u2013 en katedral or Le Cyclop.Tinguely died in 1991 at the age of 66 years in the Bern Hospital of heart failure.\n\n\n== Public works ==\nChaos I (1974), sculpture in The Commons, Columbus, Indiana, USA\nLe Cyclop outside of Milly-la-For\u00eat.\nThe Stravinsky Fountain  (fr: La Fontaine Stravinsky)  near the Centre Pompidou, Paris (1983), a collaboration with Niki de Saint Phalle.\nCarnival Fountain (Fasnachtsbrunnen) (1977) in Basel.\nTinguely Fountain (1977) in Basel.\nLifesaver Fountain on K\u00f6nigstrasse in Duisburg, Germany, a collaboration with Niki de Saint Phalle\nJo Siffert Fountain (commonly called Tinguely Fountain), Fribourg, Switzerland\nLa Cascade, sculpture in the Carillon Building lobby, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA\nM\u00e9tamatic generative sculptures (1950s)\nLuminator (1991), on loan until 2014 to the EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse\n\n\n=== Hon \u2013 en katedral ===\nHon \u2013 en katedral (Swedish: \"She, a Cathedral\") was an art installation that was shown at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm in 1966. The exhibition consisted of a sculpture of a colorful pregnant woman lying on her back with her legs wide apart. The sculpture was 25\u201326 meters long, about 6 meters high and 11 metres wide.  It was built of scaffolding and chicken wire covered with fabric and fiberglass, painted with brightly coloured poster paint.  Through a door-sized entry in the location of the woman's vagina, visitors could go into the sculpture. Inside was a screen showing Greta Garbo films, a goldfish pond, and a soft drink vending machine. Johann Sebastian Bach's organ music played through speakers.  The exhibition was created by Niki de Saint-Phalle, Tinguely and Per Olov Ultvedt. It had 80,000 visitors during the exhibition period from June 4 to September 9, 1966.\n\n\n== Noise music recordings ==\n1963 'Sounds of Sculpture', 7, Minami Gallery, Tokyo, Japan_[Tinguely's sculptures recorded by avant-garde composer Toshi Ichiyanagi during Japanese exhibition]\n1972 'M\u00e9ta', book+7_, Propyl\u00e4en Verlag, Stockholm\n1983 'Sculptures at The Tate Gallery, 1982'_, Audio Arts cassette\n1983 'Meta-Harmonie H' incl. in \u2018Meridians 2_ compmqenan ate a pie\n2001 'Relief Meta-Mechanique Sonore I' incl. in 'A Diagnosis' compilation, Revolver-Archiv f\u00fcr Aktuelle Kunst, Frankfurt am Main, Germany\n\n\n== Influence on others ==\nIn Arthur Penn's Mickey One (1965) the mime-like Artist (Kamatari Fujiwara) with his self-destructive machine is an obvious Tinguely tribute.\nSurvival Research Laboratories, directed by Mark Pauline (USA)\nD.A.

          "Ok, but not a huge amount to see, quite expensive for content.",
          "Rather pricey but still worth a visit. Quite interactive and very unique displays. Worth checking out when they have special exhibitions on. It's a bit more expensive but there is a bit more to see than when there are no special exhibitions on. We spent around 1.5 to 2 hours here",

          "Without the element of surprise of a first visit, coming back after two years was still worthwhile. There was more time to read the accompanying text and especially the story of Tinguely's life at the start of the visit, and to reflect about why his art is so representative of",

          "Our friends who are originally from Basel recommended this museum. It is a bit off from the center but very easily reachable by bus. I did not know what to expect, not being familiar with the artist. But I was not disappointed. Entrance fee is 10.00 SFR. One has to be patient",
          "The museum certainly contains some impressive works of moving sculpture. However having been round the exhibits I was asking myself which of us was nuttier, Tinguely for creating them or me for not appreciating their appeal.",
          "A very original museum. Although modern it is not at all unfriendly or aimed to attract only the ones who are involved into modern art. I was really interested to see these peculiar objects and enjoyed the artist's creativity and imagination! Very good for children! Very nice",
          "Beautiful location, good review of Tinguely's life, development and evolving success. The music machines was interesting, the idea the machines makes started some thoughts. Nice to see how small children was really fascinated by the playing machines.",
          "This is a super original museum. I recommend it for all ages. It is unique, interactive and surprising. Also the museum shop (I love museum shops) has excellent memory gifts or trip gifts for you or someone you feel like giving a present! The outdoor garden is also something you",
          "Whilst I enjoyed my visit, I found it a bit limited. It was fun for about half an hour but then I'd had enough. It seemed to be more something for kids. There were some plus points including... - a nice walk along the Rhine to get there (NB the bridge nearest the museum has",
          "Fabulous for families, this interactive museum is noisy, colorful and fascinating, spoiled only by the hawkish Swiss security regimen. We've been many times and love the exhibits. The space has a wonderful position right on the Rhine and a great riverside cafe. Like many",
          "The Tinguely museum offers very unusual exhibitions that are good for both adults and children. The museum is easy to reach by various buses and trams connection from the train station nearby Germany and France. The Chez Jeanot restaurant serves vey nice easy lunches good for",
          "The artist was famous for his moving art and as such this art is attractive for kids. If you are looking for a museum to start getting your kids to appreciate art, this is the place.",
          "We got some free tickets to visit this museum, and we really enjoyed ourselves! The pieces make music/noises and move at random times, so you're always surprised what might come next. Interesting to read of the life of Jean Tinguely too!",
          "I did not know what to expect from this museum, but it was wonderful. We spent much more time there than I expected. Tinguely's creations are very interesting both to see and hear. And the ticket taker was kind enough to give me a student price ticket.",
          "It is by far my favorite museum in Basel. The genius of Jean Tinguely is usually spotted at the Tinguely fountain in the center, but visiting the museum is a much more intense experience. The collection of machines in that one space is truly mind-blowing and definitely worth",
          "get the full tinguely experience even the special exhibitions are great stuff in the contemporary art world don't miss it when u visit basel",
          "spacious and pleasant museum, full of kinetic machines. i really liked the tinguely biography wall overlooking the river rhine. the artwork was clearly labelled and good explanations overall. the shop is a bit of a let down",
          "Several machines varying in size from tiny to huge!! And they start on pressing a button, and go into movement for about 30 secs. Designed by Jean Tinguely, the museum is full of fun stuff to look at and machines that one has never seen the like of before. Very unique, a must",
          "Fantastic museum dedicated to the sculptor/artist Jean Tinguelly. I had never heard of him before visiting Basel so it was a very pleasant discovery. The exhibits are mostly made of moving parts creating zany contraptions that play musical instruments etc. Think professor Potts",
          "A beautifully-situated and well-designed museum with a wonderful collection. The museum has a great restaurant on the bottom floor, facing the stunning Rhein.Strongly recommended.",
          "The museum is in a small park beside the Roche campus near the river Rhine. Some structures are on display in the garden like the fountain with its wheels and hoses spraying water. It is \u20ac18 to look around - a bit pricey but even a glance through the outer glass gives the sense",
          "A very interesting museum containing many items of Tinguely's work. They are not all constantly on which can be frustrating (but is understandable) so you have to linger by each one, or come back later and try again. The ground floor was closed during our visit but we still",
          "The building this is in is beautiful. The art is strange. I'm not any kind of art expert, but everything looked like it was found in a junk yard and haphazardly welded together. Not my thing.",
          "This is probably the most unique art museum that I have ever seen. The museum is on the north bank of the Rhine river. Entrance fee is 15 francs for adult admission. If you have the tourist pass admission is discounted 50%. The exhibits are interactive and guests can activate",
          "I visited on the recommendation of an artist friend. As a anti-comsumerist I was fascinated with the concept of Tinguey 's art. A real experience not to be missed if in the area.",
          "Nice museum. Being an engineer I like all things mechanisms, so Jean Tinguely's work was right up my street! Only thing I would say is it was a little expensive at 36'ish Euros for 2 people. Although, I would recommend you go see this.",
          "Jean Tinguely's art is very unique form of kinestethic art and this is an experience for the whole family! Children also like the interactive pieces of art, and they can launch the movement of the objects themselves. To the adults, Tinguely's art represents strong opinion",
          "A thoroughly enjoyable experience, the Museum is a treat for every age group. The wonderful creations defy genre boundaries. Seeing these creations puts a smile on your face while giving you something to think about - an intellectual carnival, of sorts!",
          "Art like you've never seen it before!! I'm not a huge art expert so don't always enjoy this type of museum, but this was very unique and interesting. Worth a visit. Lots of buttons for kids to press too so all the kids I saw were enjoying it too! And you can't say that very",
          "Trying to work out the mind of this man is impossible. His concepts are truly mind-blowing. many of his works can be activated by foot pedals and are even more amusing when they 'move'. Like everything in Switzerland it is not cheap to enter but well worthwhile.",
          "I didn't quite know what to expect as I am not sure if I understand modern art. The Tinguely museum is well worth a visit once you get past the weird pseudo religious art in the main hall. Make your way upstairs to the mechanical installations, they are a hoot and children",
          "The Tinguely could be described as Dr Seuss meets Rube Goldberg. His fun and fascinating contraptions are so fun to enjoy from all angles. The image I included is my favorite piece of a deconstructed Formula 1 race car. It is so much more than that, but you'll just have to go",
          "The artist made machine sculptures engaging in a loud and multi-coloured conversation with the onlooker. The machine functions and becomes art. Its really a funny place for children and those which are still children. Tinguely`s artworks sparkle with wit, vitality, irony and",
          "The Tinguely museum is always worth a visit whether you're an art lover or parent with children that are hard to please. So many things to see and do and sometimes even be part of. A very fun museum, in a beautiful building, ideal for a visit on a rainy day.",
          "A bit expensive to see sculptures made of recycled parts. To operate each, you had to step in a foot pad which would activate it. But, if the sculpture had been activated for as much as five minutes prior to you, it wouldn't work. So, you had to either wait until the magic time",
          "Good fun with kids.. Everything moves.. An artist with some strange artwork but good fun to see that everything will move with one touch..",
          "My 7 year old and I both enjoyed this unusual but fun and interactive museum. There are pieces which becomes alive by stepping on the with foot pedal, note that some it takes few minutes for it to reset before it will work again. I would recommend, there's no other museum like",
          "The Tinguely exhibits were so impressive.This was a very hands on exhibition as there were buttons in front of some of the pieces which would activate the sculptures. There was also some interesting infomation about Tinuely's life. The only thing which spoilt the visit was an",
          "We spent a 1-2 hrs here some interesting exhibits, my wife not impressed thought they were depressing. I can see her point but as an engineer I appreciated the ingenuity of the constructions of the works of art. The special exhibit of Jim clarks F1 racing car was just an added",
          "A terrific museum - fun for adults & children alike. I would have enjoyed an English language tour - only French & German.",
          "This place is humorously enchanting, artsy, and entertaining. JT was a genius! Great fun and my kids (4 &5) loved it!",
          "Awesome interestig and funky museum located next to great walking paths by the Rhine River. If you love interesting machinery this museum is for you.",
          "We loved the sculptures in the fountain by the Theatre. Museum has information on Tinguely's life. Also on his big self-destructive artwork in New York with copy of NY Times article. Bunch of mostly small pieces of art almost all of which have a step on/off switch.",
          "The impressive modern building warrants a visit, regardless of the exhibitions. Jean Tinguely contraptions are quite amazing. Kids will love it. Worth visiting the shop. Full of interesting toys for kids as well as adults.",
          "Enjoyed by us all, even the gallery adverse 12 year old, plenty of moving crazy exhibits that make a lot of noise. Part of the collection is closed at the moment but worth a visit.",
          "It is quite interactive and so is cool but is expensive. It cost 15 francs an adult (we thought it would be free). However it was good inside and we'll laid out",
          "It was very interesting to see the most amazing \"contraptions\" Tinguely built - the only thing that was a little frustrating about this visit, was waiting for each sculpture(?)/model(?) to work.",
          "Whilst I enjoy automata and modern art this museum was a let down. These exhibits were not as good the Tinguely fountains we'd seen and the 'modern art' was very formulaic",
          "We are going there regularly during winter time. The machines are well presented, very funny with young kids starting 3 years old.",
          "Tinguelly is well known internationally but here in Basel he appears to be revered although his early career included being sacked as a window dresser by the grandest store in Town. Shades of the \"then and now\" relationship between Van Gogh and Arles. This has interactive",
          "The building itself is a masterpiece of modern architecture and has a great collection of Tinguely's objects",
          "The artwork of mr. Tinguely is based on recycled materials. It might be interesting for some people, but for me it's not. The premises are very nice tough.",
          "I have been to this museum a number of times - many with my kids when they were small, more recently for an exhibition where one is blindfolded and guided through a tour where you touch replica's of ancient statues - naked young men (Egyptian and Greek)... Jean TInguely is a",
          "Walked along the Rhine on a Spring day and found this beautiful museum. Although there are buses you can take back into the city, the stroll was nice. It's a good represenation of the artist's life work and might not appeal to everyone's taste, it was a nice afternoon spent. The",
          "We visited the Museum after seeing the Tinguely Fountain. We enjoyed the exhibition and the inventiveness of the artist. Weird contraptions.",
          "We ended up at this museum by default - we had already \"done\" the old city the previous day and had a couple of hours to spare this morning before our river cruise boarded. We took a taxi at about 10:15 as it is a bit out of the way to navigate to this museum by bus/tram, only",
          "This was my second visit to the museum. I realised that each visit is unique. We had great fun with my son. The permenant collection and interactive exhibitions were amasing.",
          "Really enjoyed this museum - very interactive with some fascinating art work. Would highly recommend going.",
          "A parge collection of Tinguely's charming mechanical constructions and other work. Temporary exhibitions highlight artists from his circle",
          "I am not a big modern art fan (white canvas and blue line), but, the kinetic sculptures and special exhibition plus photos and his history brings his anarchism to life - gloriously. Very easy to get to/from Basel center. Cafe downstairs very busy, prices seemed high, but, it's",
          "Great museum for all family members. Changing expositions make it worth coming every now and then. Nice building with great style. In summer: Garden/Park is great to make a rest with kids after visit. Or a walk along the rhine is also great.",
          "The Tinguely Museum was a very good way to spend an afternoon. The exhibits were mechanically interesting and made me wonder how Tinguely's mind worked to construct these pieces. They drew the visitor in as some of the exhibits had motion and others were interactive. Fun place",
          "In this moving museum you can see really interesting art you would like to have at home. For some inspiration first go to the Tinguely Fountain, for even more fascinating art go to the Museum.",
          "My friend and I unfortunately just missed the Ben Vautier exhibition but thought we should visit anyway. We were extremely disappointed! Luckily we are students so got a reduced entry price of 10 CHF but still at that it was a complete waste of money! The museum is bare and",
          "they are a few museum really interactive in the world because for most of them the instructions are \"don't touch\" . That's why tinguely museum is so attractive for families because here the motto is touch.The works of Tinguely have something special you like or not, but The",
          "I visited the museum with my family, including children ages 4 and 2. Many pieces of art here are interactive and move or make noise. My 4 year old son loved pushing the buttons and watching the artwork move. The loud noise sometimes scared my 2 year old daughter, but overall",
          "I also chose 4 stars because, as an earlier reviewer notes, their is a large assemblage on tour. Regardless, there are many working assemblages, spanning Tinguely's entire career, and a good amount of information on his work. Kids will love this, although the assemblages have",
          "The museum was interesting, but I thought it was overpriced, especially since the largest exhibit of Tinguely's work in the museum is currently out on tour. The museum contained a good written and photographic history of Jean Tinguely (also in English, which was nice), so I did",
          "It is a very mdern Museum located in basel. Tinguely it is an artist from Switzerland whose specialization it is the machinery and those who love machinery will enjoy visiting his museum with his clocks and machines. The architect who build the building it is Mario Botta",
          "Perhaps less a museum than more a exhibition of a very specific form of art in a nice environment. It gives a good overview on the lifetime of the artist and shows a representative collection of his art. As they are bizarre and many of them can be set into movement you get",
          "I ended up visiting this museum by accident, after checking out Solitude Park. However, we spent a truly absorbing couple of hours in the museum. We had no prior familiarity with Jean Tinguely's work, and were fascinated by the interactive nature of his art. The Ben Vautier",
          "The museum is a bit away from the Basel city center, but I took the 20-25 minute walk along the Rhine to get to this museum so that I can enjoy the beautiful views along the river (you'll also pass the Roche Tower if you're walking eastwards to the museum). At the museum, you",
          "Fantastic!!! A lot of interesting machines art. Very impressive. My kids was so excited!! Nice place to visit and enjoy",
          "Most interesting of all museums, art made out of unwanted materials. I thought this would be boring but Jean Tinguelys imaginative take on what constitutes art is nothing short of inspiring. The museum is interactive, well lit with lovely spaces",
          "This museum is a little out of town. The building inits self has a stylish and modern look, designed by Mario Botta. Tinguely works are composed of small and big installations made mostly out of scrap metal spread out on four floors. There is usually a special exhibition",
          "Excellent contemporary art museum. Collection of artworks of Jean Tinguely, an artist who lived in Basel. As opposed to many (too many) contemporary art works his artworks contain content and skills. We spent about two hours - not enough, so we will come once more next time we",
          "My husband loves scrap metal, so I thought this museum would interest him. He loved it. We enjoyed learning about this gentleman's history and seeing his work. It was a beautiful walk to get there along the River Rhine thru a park.",
          "One of the best museums I've been to. Tingluely is an absolute genius. The exhibition of Ben Vautier impressed me a lot to. I liked that I could touch some of the exhibitions, press the buttons and activate mechanisms. The only disadvantage that each button to activate work",
          "A collection of motorised mobiles and machinery all seemingly made out of junk metal by Jean Tinguely. Some were interesting and fun to watch, but a whole museum of this stuff is too much I think. I suppose children would be interested, especially pressing the foot button used",
          "This sculptor is just plain fun, and now there is a museum to see a lot of his work in one place. He puts together mechanized assemblages of off bits of metal - but they often seem to take on a personality! The exhibits are on timers, so that you can only activate them some of",
          "Tinguely was more than an artist. He was an inventor, a great one. And he combines these 2 things in fantastic gadgets with incredible mechanics and they \"do nothing\" but delighting our senses. It's a museum even for those who doesn't enjoy \"art's places\". It's impossible not to",
          "Great museum, for adults and children alike. My 11 year old daughter got to step on buttons and engage the artworks move and let sounds off. It is very inspiring for the children and adults to use found objects for art making. \\It also had a very neat little things in the",
          "Objects made from scrap that are made for the purpose of having fun, both as a viewer, participant and artist. Perhaps because I was of the era of these objects they were greatly enjoyed by me, and the museum itself is attactive with its entry fountain and rooms that can be",
          "Really interesting gallery, even for someone (like me) who isn't usually interested in this type of art. Three floors of exhibits, well worth the entrance fee (I paid 10 Francs as a student - usual price is 12 for students but I think they discounted the entrance fee as his most",
          "This museum was only for those who visits all museums in all cities. For us it was too strange. The stuff here was only a bunch of metal junk.",
          "Very quirky stuff indeed! Need to go with an open mind about what constitutes ART :) Other than the exhibits the museum has a large outdoor place ideal for a relaxing walk!",
          "If you like the art by Tinguely, it is an absolute must! In addition, they have changing expositions on display; so far all we have seen were really nice and interesting. Somif you like modern art, you will like it! Finally, the architecture of the museum is worthwhile a visit.",
          "Great museum along the river in basel, perfect place to take children as many of the sculptures are interactive. My daughter adored it.",
          "Interesting large scale works from the 1950-1980 period that are well displayed. Many of the large scale pieces can be put into motion by the viewer",
          "Tinguely was big into kinetic sculptures, things that move as part of the art. It may not be everybody's cup of tea, but if you are into that kind of thing, it's worth checking out. It's not particularly big so you would only spend 2 hours there at most but it's worth checking",
          "Basel is a world art center, home of the Art Basel annual show. Therefore, many art world folk come to Basel at least once per year. It would be tempting, therefore, for some of them to check out this museum, which is fine, but it would be a serious mistake to give that visit",
          "Awesome place! We went there for an exhibition where apart from looking at art you also need to smell it. You are also encouraged to paint stuff yourself!",
          "As the title said I think that if this is your type of thing you will love it but not a place for trying to get out of the sun and use the museum pass. To me it wasn't very exciting, although I can understand that others may find it very different and I can recognise that some",
          "The Jean Tinguely Museum is one of those rare musuems where the exhibits are also playthings, and for enjoyment! The mechanical exhibits on display sent me back decades to my childhood and me and my fellow travel mate wreaked havoc in a way only children can. Unfortunately there",
          "If you like Tinguely art works is good to visit. This year exposition of Haroon Mirza was not one of my favorite so I was not happy with it, but it's a personal point of view. Life and artworks from Tinguely are alays interesting for me. So it worth a visit.",
          "I had vaguely heard of Tinguely, but after seeing his fountains in the centre of Basel decided to visit the Museum. Before I forget: the building, by Mario Botta, is a work of art by itself. Whether what Tinguely produced is art remains a matter of debate, but he surely helps",
          "Jean Tinguely's work is very interesting, but the general feel was that there wasn't enough of it. Also, there must be a better way to manage the timing of the machines...",
          "This museum displays the work and invention of Jean Tinguely. A kind of engineer, inventor and architect. It is not a big museum so great to do with kids also. The machine are quite amazing and kids will enjoy. There is small rooms everywhere and you never got bored by going",
          "Jean Tinguely Museum is really unique. In this museum instead of looking at paintings you smell them. Basically he turned art into smell which is really interesting and fun for kids especially. There are a lot of different smells from nice to bitter, strong smells to soft",
          "Tinguely was a mad genius. His ingenious mechanical contraptions are hilarious and inspiring. The City correctly recognizes his significance as an artist and built a beautiful functional space to showcase not just his work, but well thought out temporary exhibitions as well. We",
          "Visited the permanent exhibition of Tinguely's work and the temporary exhibition \"Belle Haleine\" . The museum itself designed by Botta is a beautiful building sent in gardens next to the Rhein. A little bit out of the centre, but in nice weather its a beautiful walk by the",
          "Stunning and interactive exhibition and museum! We loved it. We saw the Belle Haleine exhibition. It is also nice to visit with children, who will love playing with Tinguely's pieces of art",
          "Museum is not in the city centre so you will either need to get a bus or (as we did) get the boat from the paper mill and then alk through a very nice park for half an hour. Like everything in Basle its expensive to get in but is half price to basel card holders (you also get",
          "A fabulous experience, the whole exhibit is around smell, odors, sweat and spices.Contemporay artists inviting you to smell, feel and experience, it's unique and fun. And then you an can wander through Tinguely's sculptures and enjoy the park by the river. Everything will smell",
          "Very unique in itself, as Tinguely's art is something out of the ordinary concepts. A very nice view of the city from the inside, to add value to the visit.",
          "Surprising exhibits, beautifull building and location. Spacious. Location is at Rhine river with a small beach nearby the museum bar.",
          "This was an interesting experience. There were parts that I loved and other parts that I hated (really hated), some of it was just way to creepy for me. I rushed through sections of it while my husband loved it a could have stayed longer. We knew this was going to be way out of",
          "Really enjoyed it. Most of the things unfortunately did not work at that time but otherwise it is a great place to visit indeed!",
          "Pure kinetic art. Worth visiting with the kids, especially if you have boys. I'm not sure if all the girls will be very much interested in all this mechanisms, though the fact that it's in a way interactive makes it much more fun: almost each exhibit has a button and when you",
          "This is a very interesting and interactive museum to be visited with kids. Most of the exhibits can be switched on so it's a great enjoyment both for the kids and the adults to wander in this museum. The museum shop is also very good, I bought some very nice mechanical toys for",
          "The museums a little out of town but a short walk along side the Rhine river soon get you there. It's a nice walk in summer. Winter can be spectacular with the snow down and the icicles around. The perminant displays are great for the kids. Most work (with some of the bigger",

          "User-friendly Museum of kinetic wildly-imaginative (and huge) gizmos by Jean Tinguely, even the shadows are interesting! Inter-active and fun for adults, too. Do not miss!",
          "A tribute to Jean Tinguely the maverick artist, the museum is a whirlwind of exhibits that all move, whether they are fist sized or the size of an entire room. Unusual, surprising and sometimes even shocking.",
          "A great museum, built for an incredibly imaginative artist. Kids enjoyed it because they could press buttons and watch the pieces move. One you could even climb on. Glad we went.",
          "This is a fun stop with kids as there are buttons to push and the art work becomes animated (mechanically). The buttons are timed, so they will not always work when you push them, this is to preserve the art work. At time's there is some very, very weird, or eclectic, art",
          "Even if you aren't familiar with works of Jean Tinguely, this is a museum you can't afford to miss in Basel. The collection and presentation is very nice. And most important of all, it is a very nice building designed by Mario Botta. Usually you don't expect much from a museum",
          "A sense of humour is essential when you visit this great museum. Super location, by the side of the wide river Rhine. A spacey, airy building housing the collection of artworks by kinetic artistJean Tinguely. This is perhaps not for everybody, but I love the way he has made the",

          "Jean Tinguely was famous for his kinetic sculptures consisting of (mostly) odd scraps and discarded pieces of metail. They are mostly large and this museum houses a superb collection of his work. However it is not to everyone's taste and I have to admit to finding it hard to",
          "I have now had visited on a number of occasions the Jean Tinguely Museum and it is without doubt a wonderful collection which never ceases to bring a smile to my face. I have had the pleasure of experiencing the collection with both young and old and the delight and wonder it",
          "We went here for free, and found the automation to be quite fascinating. The hands on experience makes it interesting for young hands too, but it did leave me thinking that the whole experience was a little weird.... I think that's their aim.",
          "Amazing use of recycled material to display movement. There is a 7 minute \"recovery\" period before being able to activate the moving displays so it is a bonus not to have anyone close in front of you pressing all the electrical displays",
          "The museum is located in a lush green park directly at the Rhine river, only a few bus stops from the city center. The architecture of the building alone is worth a visit, the exhibits even more so. Everything is humming, clicking, moving. You have to look for quite some time",
          "This museum is dedicated to the Swiss artist for whom it's named, Jean Tinguely, best know for his kinetic art sculptures. And you'll find plenty of them here in this nicely designed building by the Rhein. As you enter the grounds, one of the first things you see is a fountain",

          "This museum is a little different from other art sculpture museums -- it does have only Tingluely's things and is a little hands on -- sometimes you have to wait to see things move, definitely unique.",
          "Gosh can't add much to recent reviews apart from to say gives a great context to the film but more especially is the place of recent history of Basel . Good for family whit child !",
          "This is a very unusual art museum consisting of machine sculptures built by Tinguely throughout his life. They all move in chaotic fashion when turned on and will amaze you in their complexity and humor. The museum has four floors but can viewed in a couple of hours and is a",

          "(pronounced Tangley) We have visited numerous museums in many countries and this one rates in the top 10. The quirky interactive exhibits draw in adults and children. Wonderfully entertaining. Get a cool drink in the lower level cafe and watch locals floating in the Rhine.",
          "I found Zilvinas Kempina's Slow Motion pieces to be the highlight. Very helpful and personable staff.",
          "JT was called the 'poet of machines' (a rough translation), and what I found there on a solo trip to Basel last weekend was just that, some very whimsical 'machines' (they whir, they click, they move a bit, they make noise...they're fun) of different sizes. Many you can start",
          "If you are in Basel and you enjoy Art from the 1960's, you may want to visit the Tinguely Museum. This museum is dedicated to its name sake Jean Tinguely who experimented with kinetic sculptures. Especially kids will probably enjoy the whimsical contraptions with which you are",
          "It was very stimulating and funny. I especially loved the floating tape that took up the whole room. It was mesmerizing! Parking and finding the place was difficult, even with GPS.",
          "Have always found the fountain in the city centre by Tinguely great fun, so this museum was on our list. We were not disappointed, though you have to wait a1/4 hour between pressing the knobs to put the machines on, so pace yourself and don't put them all on at once. In a little",
          "This is a fab museum, recommendable for children and older people with a young state of mind. Despite being part of a big pharma company, it is actually a joy to visit. There are several expositions a year, next to the standard Tinguely collection worth visiting. If you do",
          "Jean Tinguely did some really nice stuff with his creations. either you love it or not, i did and i still do. I would suggest you to give it a try and have a look.",
          "You need to love Tinguely. Its special constructions are a unique example of Modern Art; If you do not know this special artist (who died years ago), first try to have a look at the website of this museum and then you decide if you would like seeing its works of modern art",
          "Went here on a recent weekend to Basel. The entrance was free with our Baselcard (get it at the tourist office). The museum is well set up. You have a nice history at the beginning and then you proceed to see the artwork. The art isn't always on because they want to preserve",
          "Jean Tinguely is the main artist featured here. His works include wire sculptures, kinetic reliefs, drawings, and music machines as well as his famous rotation sculptures. Also, be sure to go see the Tinguely working (Fasnachtsbrunnen) Carnival Fountain in town on",
          "Enjoyed our visit very much. Unique experience, as adults we enjoyed it, I think that children would have an especially fun time. I would not skip other Basel attractions to pay a visit, but if you have the time and interest it is well worth the trip.",
          "The museum show places the work of a genius. The work raises the issue as to whether the artist wants you to join him at laughing at certain aspects of society, or whether the persons who take the exhibit seriously are being laughed at by the artist. If modern art turns you off",
          "After reading the reviews here we made a special effort to visit this museum and what a let down. The only interesting thing about this museum is that people think this is worth a visit. It's like looking at garbage that has been put on display. The worst part of the",
          "The collection of Tinguely works bring you a lot of fun, but you must see them in running. (sometimes the red knobs do not work). Wish to know more about Tinguely life, e.g. his left things, his bibliography, short stories behind the machines exhibited, etc. I went there on",
          "See this! Tinguely's works move and shake and do all kinds of fun stuff. Our Swiss Pass gave us free admission. It was easy to find. There were other artists exhibited that were terrific. We ate good kebab right across from the Museum.",
          "The Museum Tinguely is located in a beautiful spot on the Rhine in Klein Basel, and is a very nice architectural statement in its own right. It was erected to house a lot of the quite extraordinary moving and shaking creations of the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely, and it also has",
          "Everyone who is in this museum behaves like a kid. So wonderful. Such fun. Also make sure you see the Tinguely Fountain in Basel itself. Perfect for what ails modern life these days.",
          "Museum is reachable by trams that run through Wettsteinbr\u00fccke and Klein Basel. Museum exhibits Jean Tinguely's iron works. The most intriquing work to me is the water fountain outside of the museum, built on wheels and gears and move harmonically with water ejecting at the same",
          "and a bit unusual. It's a great stop to combine with a walk along the Rhine and a ferry trip across.",
          "This was amazing! All the \"machines\" moved, at the touch of a red ball. Even the very big ones - and they were VERY big! I, and my friends, stayed there for over two hours.",

          "Tinguely was a crazy guy and his artwork alone would be a good reason to visit, even to travel to Switzerland. But also the additional exhibitions are very unusual, interesting and fascinating. I've never seen so nice sculptures and art in any other place. The guides are very",
          "This is an odd museum but an absolute must if you have children who are fascinated by anything mechanical. We don't have kids but had loads of fun anyway. Jean Tinguely is an artist who creates strange sculptures out of metal that move..... One of them even draws on paper!",
          "This is such a great, interactive museum. The kids will love all of its moving pieces and the adults for the brain gymnastics. Definitely take the time to wait for your favorite pieces to be set in motion (not all are allowed to be going at the same time.) It is so worth it.",
          "Jean Tinguely is a Basel artist who makes mechanical sculptures. Many of them are concentrated in this museum while others are scattered throughout Basel. While entertaining to see them move (you push a button), I have a hard time calling this art. Children will love it,",
          "Jean Tinguely is not the only artist\\sculptor in his museum, but it is mostly him. There are red buttons to make the sculptures move but they only run every 5 minutes to preserve it. No matter what age anyone will have fun.",
          "Quite a walk along the Rhine from Bankverein tram stop. Down the river on one side, up the other, to this gorgeous, open art museum with whimsical moving and noise making modern sculptures, regular exhibitions by other modernists and a nearby park to relax in after the tour. A",
          "The curator is quite clever and always puts Tinguely in a dialogue with other artists, so even though the main focus is indeed on Tinguely (who also did the Carneval Fountain by the theatre in town), there is often another artist juxtaposed. It's a very nice museum to go with",
          "A one man show that doesn't get boring. Beautiful building in a beautiful park on the bank of the river Rhine.",
          "Very intriguing \"art machines\", definitely worth a visit",
          "The Jean Tinguely museum is one of the least-well advertised places I have found in Basel. I discovered it quite by chance, near the German railway station. But it is a major attraction \u2013 a stunning building in a stunning location. Don\u2019t miss it if you have any interest in",
          "Main works of Jean Tinguely. The building per se is interesting and modern. Very little explanation of the works, though.",
          "Tinguely certainly made a lot out of junk. I enjoyed a few of the kinetic sculptures, particularly the Tinguely fountain (not here but in Barfussplatz) but there's only so many kinetic whirlygigs that I can put up with. Also once a sculpture has been activated, it takes 5 - 7",
          "I liked all the machines? on display. I truly appreciate the creative thinking of the artist/engineer!",
          "Such a great place. Everybody was so friendly. We speak Italian (we speak German too) but when they heard us speaking Italian everybody made the effort either to speak Italian with the children or French with us. The Museum itself is beautiful and the exhibits are truly",
          "The exhibits rotate - literally, the permanent Tingley pieces move and are fun to see, and also about a quarter of the exhibits change fairly frequently. The building has beautiful views of the Rhine and is a wonderful space to visit. This is a fun, interesting museum of modern",
          "The whimsical kinetic sculptures make this place a must for families. Make no mistake, this is art, full of irony, cryptic references, and dadaist spirit. Treat it as seriously or as lightly as you want. It's also a great place to take pictures of your family or loved ones,",
          "Curious how a load of junk, welded together and electrified can make you laugh. Ingenious but essentially useless contraptions unless you count their amusement value which in itself, I suppose makes the exhibits useful. A fun place to take children.",
          "Thought the interactivity and movement of most of the pieces was intereseting enough for younger childer (older then 6) while still anexceptional museum for us Adults (older childernat heart). While not many of the classical portatis and sculputres that is part of what",
          "For young and old - art lovers or not - this is an amazing place to spend an hour or two. It certainly gives you food for thought and is entertaining at the same time. Definitely a message for the over-materialistic!",
          "interesting sculptures that can be activated every 7 minutes - very tantalizing for little hands - maybe too much! still very interesting.",
          "Very nice museum with large installations from Tinguely and lot's of other art and information. Children love this too !",
          "worth a visit, especially if you like crazy machines. The nice architecture and the location overlooking the Rhine is also worth mentioning.",
          "See the work of a genius artist and mechanist. Very stunning because the most artworks are still working.",
          "After visiting the Jean Tinguely museum, I was even prouder of being Swiss! It is amazing and inspiring what this contemporary artist created, his pieces of art excude playfullness, imagination and make you feel like a child again. Also, the museum itself is a beautifully",
          "This museum showcases the best of Jean Tinguely. You can see some amazing installations, watch them move and turn, feel them, draw with them..... an all sensory experience. The city of Basel also has a Tinguely fountain installation near the cathedral which makes for incredible",
          "I found the art to be of interest but the museum is quite small and you will have seen everything in a few minutes. One of the pieces broke down while we were there, and no one seemed to be in a hurry to have a look at what went wrong. I found there to be a strange smell in the",
          "I visit Tinguely almost every time I'm in Basel. Always a great experience.",
          "This museum appeals to the small child in me. The exhibts do stuff! There is movement. There are sounds. What's not to like?",
          "The walk to the museum along the river is extremely nice. For families with little children, there is a small wooden playground close to the museum...you can't miss it if you walk along the river. My 4 year old son enjoys the museum, but finds some of the artwork to be",

          "The marketing and advertisements for the museum make it look wonderful and very appealing to kids (lot's of mechanical contraptions) but this is not so when you get inside. It is a modern art gallery in our mind and there is nothing wrong with that. You can spend a good few",
          "Have waited a long time to get to know Tingely's works and his museum. The architecture and location are just fabulous and the exhibits give you an excellent overview of the artist's work. We missed a plan of the museum and a video describing the artist's life. The lady at",
          "Pushing buttons and exploring how Tinguely stuck a whole lot of junk together and made it all move was super cool. This was probably one of the most fun museums I've been to. Some of the exhibits felt like kids might not get it (thinking of: Robert Breer special exhibit; not",

          "This is an amazing museum. It offers an awful lot of interactive facitilites (great for kids) and you get a chance to discover the art of this mad man, wait for it, FOR FREE! The parking wasn't great, there is no designated free carpark but that fits in with Basel's policy and",
          "Took our young children there one rainy morning and they had an absolute blast. We had previously explained who Tinguely was and gave them an idea of what to expect and they were absolutely fascinated by all the moving parts etc. There was also a really cool Car exhibition at",
          "Went with my 4 year old on a recent trip to Basel. She loved getting to press all the red buttons and see what happened. The only problem with kids is that the buttons are on time-delay, so once you press it, you can't press it again for 5-10 minutes. So if there are lots of",

          "Jean Tinguely was a major Swiss iron sculptor, best known for his animated mechanical statues. The \"Tinguely Fountain\", in Theatre Square in the centre of the old town, is home to one example of his work and if you like this fountain, you will really enjoy this museum."

          "We went in this beautiful church and were thrilled to know it was all welcoming. This church was built privately by a couple who wanted a place for all to be able to come. Recommend taking the 15 min self guided audio tour, english available. Church volunteers very friendly.",
          "I\u2019m a little bit of the opinion that if you\u2019ve seen one church you\u2019ve seen them all. The outside is impressive with great architectural details and the stained glass inside is impressive. It is on some of the walking tours of Basel and worth a look.",
          "During my recent visit to Basel, I got the opportunity to see this beautiful church during my morning walk. It's an beautiful architectural building in the middle of Basel city.Really worth visiting there",

          "When we visited the Church was being prepared for an event but we were able to wander round and enjoy the beautiful windows and some nativity related sculptures. Despite the activity that was going on there was a peaceful atmosphere about the place.",
          "I visited this church after visiting the Historical Museum down the block. There was a service going on, so I wandered around for a while until it was over. The interior of the church is rather plan, befitting a Lutheran church which I guess it was for a time. My eye caught",
          "Spectacular architecture within a short stroll from the Cathedral, Basel Munster. Entry is without charge and restrooms are available. This church adds another beautiful dimension to the Basel profile and photos are well worth the time of its quaint, yet majestic architecture,",

          "I had a feeling that the building does not belong to the church anymore. It is more like a place of silence, where different spiritual events can be held. The is even a cafe that I mistakenly assumed as the church entrance. It is funny that you can donate some money even if you",

          "Walk in and enjoy the freedom of a quiet space - or sometimes of a very lively place. In this church there is much more going on then religious services. Also one of the sweet little corners to sit down and have a break and a cake in the centre of Basel",
          "We discovered this place by the accident, becouse is near to theater and fountain. Inside is really nice. You can go there and took some photos, but also you can drink something inside. Go inside with dog is allowed.",
          "A smaller version of the Munster the interior has many of the same design elements. We stopped in for a short peak and sat and enjoyed the somber and pensive tone of the sweeping architecture. Thier was an option to head up to the tower, having just visited Munster an hour",
          "Actually this big Church was our first stop in the excursion in Basel when we reach the historic center from the railway station. We stayed for fifteen minutes inside and unfortunately we have no time to drink our coffee in a cafe outside the builiding.",
          "On a stroll in Basel we came across this beautiful church. It is no longer a parish church but has been restored and it open to the public. It's a wonderful place to just sit and enjoy the peace and quiet. There is a outdoor cafe next door (we were there on a warm day) and",

        "wiki": "The latissimus dorsi () is a large, flat muscle on the back that stretches to the sides, behind the arm, and is partly covered by the trapezius on the back near the midline. The word latissimus dorsi (plural: latissimi dorsi) comes from Latin and means \"broadest [muscle] of the back\", from \"latissimus\" (Latin: broadest)' and \"dorsum\" (Latin: back). The pair of muscles are commonly known as \"lats\", especially among bodybuilders. The latissimus dorsi is the largest muscle in the upper body.\nThe latissimus dorsi is responsible for extension, adduction, transverse extension also known as horizontal abduction, flexion from an extended position, and (medial) internal rotation of the shoulder joint. It also has a synergistic role in extension and lateral flexion of the lumbar spine.\nDue to bypassing the scapulothoracic joints and attaching directly to the spine, the actions the latissimi dorsi have on moving the arms can also influence the movement of the scapulae, such as their downward rotation during a pull up.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\n=== Variations ===\n\nThe number of dorsal vertebrae to which it is attached varies from four to eight; the number of costal attachments varies; muscle fibers may or may not reach the crest of the ilium.\nA muscular slip, the axillary arch, varying from 7 to 10 cm in length, and from 5 to 15 mm in breadth, occasionally springs from the upper edge of the latissimus dorsi about the middle of the posterior fold of the axilla, and crosses the axilla in front of the axillary vessels and nerves, to join the under surface of the tendon of the pectoralis major, the coracobrachialis, or the fascia over the biceps brachii. This axillary arch crosses the axillary artery, just above the spot usually selected for the application of a ligature, and may mislead a surgeon. It is present in about 7% of the population and may be easily recognized by the transverse direction of its fibers.  Guy et al. extensively described this muscular variant using MRI data and positively correlated its presence with symptoms of neurological impingement.A fibrous slip usually passes from the upper border of the tendon of the Latissimus dorsi, near its insertion, to the long head of the triceps brachii. This is occasionally muscular, and is the representative of the dorsoepitrochlearis brachii of apes. This muscular form is found in ~5% of humans and is sometimes termed the latissimocondyloideus.The latissimus dorsi crosses the inferior angle of the scapula.  A study found that, of 100 cadavers dissected:\n43% had \"a substantial amount\" of muscular fibers in the latissimus dorsi originating from the scapula.\n36% had few or no muscular fibers, but a \"soft fibrous link\" between the scapula and the latissimus dorsi\n21% had little or no connecting tissue between the two structures.\n\n\n=== Triangles ===\nThe lateral margin of the latissimus dorsi is separated below from the obliquus externus abdominis by a small triangular interval, the lumbar triangle of Petit, the base of which is formed by the iliac crest, and its floor by the obliquus internus abdominis.\nAnother triangle is situated behind the scapula. It is bounded above by the trapezius, below by the latissimus dorsi, and laterally by the vertebral border of the scapula; the floor is partly formed by the rhomboideus major. If the scapula is drawn forward by folding the arms across the chest, and the trunk bent forward, parts of the sixth and seventh ribs and the interspace between them become subcutaneous and available for auscultation. The space is therefore known as the triangle of auscultation.\nThe latissimus dorsi can be remembered best for insertion as \"A Miss Between Two Majors\". As the latissimus dorsi inserts into the floor of the intertubercular groove of the humerus it is surrounded by two major muscles. The teres major inserts medially on the medial lip of the intertubercular groove and the pectoralis major inserts laterally onto the lateral lip.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\nThe latissimus dorsi is innervated by the sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves through the thoracodorsal (long subscapular) nerve. Electromyography suggests that it consists of  six groups of muscle fibres that can be independently coordinated by the central nervous system.\n\n\n== Function ==\nThe latissimus dorsi assists in depression of the arm with the teres major and pectoralis major. It adducts, extends, and internally rotates the shoulder. When the arms are in a fixed overhead position, the latissimus dorsi pulls the trunk upward and forward.It has a synergistic role in extension (posterior fibers) and lateral flexion (anterior fibers) of the lumbar spine, and assists as a muscle of both forced expiration (anterior fibers) and an accessory muscle of inspiration (posterior fibers).Most latissimus dorsi exercises concurrently recruit the teres major, posterior fibres of the deltoid, long head of the triceps brachii, among numerous other stabilizing muscles. Compound exercises for the 'lats' typically involve elbow flexion and tend to recruit the biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis for this function. Depending on the line of pull, the trapezius muscles can be recruited as well; horizontal pulling motions such as rows recruit both latissimus dorsi and trapezius heavily.\n\n\n=== Training ===\nThe power/size/strength of this muscle can be trained with a variety of different exercises. Some of these include:\n\nVertical pulling movements such as pull-downs and pull-ups (including chin-ups).\nHorizontal pulling movements such as bent-over row, T-bar row and other rowing exercises.\nShoulder extension movements with straight arms such as straight-arm lat pulldowns and Pull-overs.\nDeadlift.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\nTight latissimus dorsi has been shown to be a contributor to chronic shoulder pain and chronic back pain.  Because the latissimus dorsi connects the spine to the humerus, tightness in this muscle can manifest as either sub-optimal glenohumeral joint (shoulder) function which leads to chronic pain or tendinitis in the tendinous fasciae connecting the latissimus dorsi to the thoracic and lumbar spine.The latissimus dorsi is a potential source of muscle for breast reconstruction surgery after mastectomy (e.g. Mannu flap)  or to correct pectoral hypoplastic defects such as Poland's syndrome.  An absent or hypoplastic latissimus dorsi can be one of the associated symptoms of Poland's syndrome.\n\n\n=== Cardiac support ===\nFor heart patients with low cardiac output and who are not candidates for cardiac transplantation, a procedure called cardiomyoplasty may support the failing heart. This procedure involves wrapping the latissimus dorsi muscles around the heart and electrostimulating them in synchrony with ventricular systole.\n\n\n=== Injury ===\nInjuries to the latissimus dorsi are rare. They occur disproportionately in baseball pitchers. Diagnosis can be achieved by visualization of the muscle and movement testing. MRI of the shoulder girdle will confirm the diagnosis. Muscle belly injuries are treated with rehabilitation while tendon avulsion injuries can be treated surgically, or with rehab. Regardless of treatment, patients tend to return to play without any functional losses.\n\n\n== Additional images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMuscle energy techniques\n\n\n== References ==\nThis article incorporates text in the public domain from page 432 of the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnatomy figure: 01:03-08 at Human Anatomy Online, SUNY Downstate Medical Center - \"Superficial layer of the extrinsic muscles of the back.\"\nCross section image: pembody/body8a\u2014Plastination Laboratory at the Medical University of Vienna",

          "Nice spot for pictures. Unusual design. Kind of reminds me of a torpedo. Monument is at the end of the pier.",
          "This is a tri-country point wherein you are in Germany, Swiss and France at the same time in Basel, Swiss! Close by to this is Cafe wherein you can have coffee and quick snacks at St. Louis as town in France. And indeed a good photo point as well!",
          "An interesting atraction to visit, is located in the middle of the river Rhine. The monument is in Swiss territory and marks the tripoint where the borders of France, Germany and Switzerland meet. The France\u2013Germany border, the Germany\u2013Switzerland border and France\u2013Switzerland",
          "I wouldn't go out of my way to see this, but I would stop if nearby (and I did!). We were on the bus tour of Basel, and they stopped here for a few minutes. Got a few pictures of being in 3 countries at once, and that was it.",
          "Worth seeing if you are passing for some other reason (in our case a river cruise) but rather underwhelming. From the river it would easily be missed if not pointed out to you.",
          "We embarked our riverboat in this area so we walked to the monument after dusk from our ship. Interesting that these countries that have so often been at odds put up this colorful & impressive monument.",
          "Border triangle of Switzerland, France and Germany. A fun place to visit if you are in the area. If you are following the path along the river, stay along the river and do not climb up steps to restaurant.",
          "I decided to travel to this place on foot from the nearest tram station and it turned out to be a long way off. I had to walk a good 30 minutes to reach the monument. You will need to ask directions if you want to reach here on your own. The place was empty - no tourists, no",
          "My Honey Bee & me were in Basel and went up to this monument of friendship among three countries. Of course, they actually touch corners in the Rhine. Nonetheless it is a tribute to the times when people can get along with each other. An unanticipated bonus was the Beach Bar",
          "This is stated to be a Symbol Of Friendship between three Neibhour\u2019s ( Germany, France and Switzerland) And they chose River Rhine in Basel for their symbol/tower of friendship. The cemented banks of the River is long and good for walking.",
          "This place is down in the port of Basel but only a short walk from the nearest tram stop. It has nice seating areas and is situated just beside the point where the Swiss, German and French borders meet. There is also food available.",
          "there is really nothing to see here except for the awareness that 3 countries meet somewhere in the middle of the river. We visited on a bus tour of the city, but no point in making a special journey.",
          "A nice place on the Rhine at the intersection of three wonderful countries. Interestingly, as you change your eyes easily, you are already in another country. This monument is easily reached, the monument is located on the German side in Weil am Rhein, 8 km from Basel Airport.",
          "It\u2019s not must see but definitely if you\u2019re in Basel it\u2019s worth to visit. I was there in March so not many tourist",
          "i would say if you are in the area it is worth it. but i would not say you need to make a special trip for this.",
          "The three country border point (or Dreilaendereck) is nice to go to if you have extra time just to say you\u2019ve been at the border of the 3 countries - France, Germany & Switzerland. Nice photo opportunity. I wanted to complain about their being no bar in the area cause I thought",
          "It was pretty cool to be able to stand in three countries at once and there is a bar located at the point so you can also grab a coffee or something else to drink. People have also ruined the tower with graffiti so you may need to adjust any photos that you take.",
          "The tripoint where the borders of France, Germany and Switzerland is in the middle of the river Rhine, the monument is built on Swiss territory. So, the point is reachable by foot from the tram line #8 (not the end station). The monument itself which looks like three plane wings",
          "You have to walk through a bit of an industrial area to get to it but I thought it was ok. I have a noisey disposition. Also if you get there early you get to watch the barges arrive and depart.",
          "A landmark that needs improvement! We stopped there from a hop on hop off bus. It needs a better presentation and new signage.",
          "Impressive spot where the 3 countries of Switzerland, Germany and France come together. Surprisingly there are not many tourists and you can see the ongoing activities of passenger and cargo ships cruising the Rhine. It\u2019s well presented but not enough in English language!",
          "This is a very neat spot showing the boundary of Switzerland, France and Germany. The problem is that it is difficult to get to and it isn't well marked. You either walk along a small path or through the recycling area. Also, it isn't much of a tourist draw, but it is",
          "Very beautiful and serene place to spend some time on a lazy afternoon. Sitting ideally for long and watching activities happening on the other side of the border is fascinating, especially for people of Asian (Indian) origin. For us, borders are always fascinating to watch for",
          "Situated among industrial zone , this is an unique symbol of friendship between three Neibhour\u2019s Germany, France & Switzerland. You can enjoy a long walk along the River with boats decked.",
          "No hop on hop off in Basil so we did the 2hr tour booked from the Information centre. The bus stopped here for 10 minutes enough time to take a few photos.",
          "This is an industrial area but out in the middle of the river is where France, Switzerland, and Germany meet. We walked from where the boat for our river cruise was docked. It was a nice river walk with other boats parked and the rocket like monument.",
          "This monument marks the point where Switzerland, Germany and France meet. To get there you have to walk through an industrial area and then by the river, so perhaps not the most accessible place, but interesting when you get there. We combined it with then walking to the",
          "Its a quiet place, very close from the local bus station, nice to visit, it was very quiet during december 2017, I even did not know which side is germany/switzerland/france.",
          "I know the distance is offputting, but fifteen minutes on tram 8 from platform F at grand station, a short walk through an industrial area & there it is. A symbol of the corner of the three nations (the map line is actually in the water), there\u2019s not a lot else there but it does",
          "A city of many faces and changing moods from idyllic residential neighbourhoods to picturesque alleys in the old town, and to modern and cool urban dwellings, you\u2019ll find all these and much more in its quarters. Let yourself be inspired.",
          "This is one of the few places in the world that is a confluence of 3 countries. You are standing at a point where Switzerland, Germany, and France meet at the Rhine River. Nice photo op.",
          "For British people being able to stand on the corner of 3 nations is something special and we were not disappointed. Approached through some very unattractive docklands, there is a real attempt her to make you feel that this is a significant point. There is also a very nice bar",
          "The monument at the tri-point marking meeting place of France Garmany and Switzerland is an impressive one.",
          "The Dreil\u00e4ndereck in Basel is not just interesting because at this spot you can visit three country, Switzerland, Germany and France, just by taking a few steps around the around a monument but also because during summer till October you can have a great beach feeling along the",
          "Fascinating landmark in Basel, at the meeting point of three great countries: Germany, France and Switzerland. The monument is rather quiet, not much visitors as I expected. It is located close to the old city but rather far from the train station",
          "I really wanted to visit Dreilaendereck for the experience of being at the same time at the crossroad of three countries. After taking the relative bus (ask the tourist office for spedific directions because there is a chance you end up in Germany) and getting off at the final",
          "Short tram ride from city centre then a good 15 min walk. The walk is not that exciting since you're walking past docked boats & industry along the river. Once you're there, you can see the pedestrian bridge that takes you from Germany to France. We got there at sunset, so",
          "This is great to say you've been in three countires almost at once! Not a lot other than looking out into the Rhine and stanmding beside a point! A must do nonetheless!",
          "The monument has the 3 flags on its side but there\u2019s little to actually do when you get there (in February at least) and little to read. For me walking across the borders was the enjoyable and novelty part, especially walking over the bridge (200 metres to the north) from",
          "Who likes gatherer attractions, so this is one of them. In a united Europe, the border triangle of three states CH / D / F which is located in the middle of the river Rhine, but of course you can find this place on the Swiss bank of the river, not far from the border with",
          "You take a tram going north from the city and then walk for 10 minutes or so alongside the industrial port area to reach this point. There is a modest modern sculpture to mark the point. It is not particularly spectacular when you get there but I thought it was worth a visit",
          "After catching the tram there is quite a long walk though industrial site!!! With 2 little kids not very nice and when you get to the end is it worth it? NO!!!",
          "I do believe Basel haven't jumped on this opportunity as much as they should. Hidden away in an industrial estate (as per the reviews said), this monument, though really lovely to look at...is ever so slightly underwhelming. It's about a 40 minute walk from Marktplatz and",
          "Dreilaendereck is a strange place hidden in the industrial part of Basel. After a 10 min walk from the nearest tram station, you find an obelisk pointing in three directions with German and French borders separated by just a narrow river. There is a restaurant nearby with an",
          "If you want to be in three different countries in less than 30 seconds, then this is one of the tripoint places to visit. It may be tough to get to without a car but thankfully we had a vehicle. It's a bit difficult to find but we managed. When we arrived early morning, there",
          "Here the border of France, German and Switzerland meet. There is a special display that sits at the point where the countries meet. This means you can run from Switzerland, through France & Germany and back in 10 seconds. Where else can you do that with no border guards?",
          "This place was not easy to get to. There is not much around in the area, it is very industrial, but my partner and I decided to walk all the way from Basel so when we finally found it, it was very satisfying. Once you do finally make it, you are able to make it to all three",
          "It was a little hard to find at first but easky accessable. It was fun to be at that if your in the area to go, you should to say you where there.",
          "The Dreilaendereck is about a 15-minute confusing walk from the closest Tram and bus line. Except for the viewpoint itself, there is not much in this area except for warehouses, rail containers and a dock for boats and ships. So, one would mostly come here only to this island to",
          "Strange but interesting. Hard to find without a gps... it is in the port or something and it is a nice monument to see and experience. Quite unique if you think what it actually represents. Glad we went and it is a great place to take unique photos. Recommended and we would go",
          "I thought this was really cool, even though my friends who live in Basel did not! I definitely recommend it for a photo op, but be aware you need a car or taxi to get there. It is not walkable from downtown Basel!",
          "Although its something people have never heard of and its somewhere to say you have been, there was nothing around it to acknowledge it, unless it was closed but no restaurant/bar or souvenir shop, it took a while to walk there so catch a tram to as far as you can then you will",
          "Pro: You can be in 3 countries at the same time, which is pretty cool. But the neighborhood, Kleinh\u00fcnigen.... Kleinh\u00fcnigen is a toilet and it is disgusting. It is dirty, and too industrial and non-scenic. It depends. But from my perspective and my point of view, this wouldn't",
          "long journey on the tram then you have to walk along river for another 15-20 min, noting to do in the area, not much to see",
          "Had to walk around 1km from the nearest tram station. Not convenient for ppl travel with babies. You can travel to 3 countries by foot in a minute. And thats the only interesting point.",
          "Fun to visit and say you stood in 3 places at the same time! Only negative I would say is it's hard to get to! Not the most convent route.",
          "Where in the world you can put your feet on a ground and allow you to make three countries border crossing, back and forth, short and easy? Dreil\u00e4ndereck is the place. The pylon structure with painted flags of Germany, Switzerland and France marks the place where three countries",
          "To be in Germany, Switzerland and France , in just 5 minutes.Only here you can see that.Take the walking bridge, and walk from France to Germany and go make shopping.then take the tramway to Basel (switzerland). the border ist just 500 meter from there.this can be funny.",
          "Curious to take your visitors during their stay. On the right, Germany, on the left, France and behind you Switzerland.",
          "Passed by as we started our river cruise from Basel to Amsterdam. Pretty cool to see somewhere that is in 3 countries - France, Germany and Switzerland.",
          "This is the spot on the Rhine where Germany, France and Switzerland meet. There is a striking monument there with all three countries flags on it. There is also a restaurant in a building (not open in the evening when we were there). In addition there were small boat three",
          "It's a good place to visit on a nice day or in the summer evening hours - especially when Basel has one of it's famous sunsets. It's best to come by car or taxi. Parking available. There's \"nothing\" around there. It's just a monument in the middle of an industrial area. If",
          "Although the border does not pass directly through Dreilaendereck, the three countries had a treaty signed of having only the monument in three countries. It is sooooooooooooooo fun especially with kids to run three to countries and able to say \"I was in three countries less",
          "There is only a monument and nothing else. Views over the Rhein to France and straight over you can see the parking of the shopping center in Germany. There is a Restaurant, but only open in summer time and if it isn't raining. So not open very often, except on a sunny Sunday in",
          "Don't bother heading out to this supposed 3-country point. It's not convenient to reach - you have to take the tram to Kleinh\u00fcningen and then walk up an industrial quay, with the only way to come back being the same way you came in. It's not a point where you are actually in 3",
          "As I understood - the real border is a little bit farer from the monument ... it's in the water 100 meters from the bank. So unfortunatelly I couldn't run around monument crying: \"Switzerland! Germany! France!\"=) But if you can realy imagine that it's the right one border or",

          "For someone who visualizes border to be fences, this is a place to visit if you are in the Trination area. From here, you could see an amazing view of the Rhine river. You could stroll from Basel to Germany and cross across the bridge into Huningue and walk there to Basel again.",
          "Nice view of Rhine River where Germany, France and Switzerland meet. In an industrial area . Interesting site to say you visited 3 countries . Some river cruise ships leave from here.",
          "A place that you need to visit just to say you have stood in three lands at one time. Really simple and basic with no frills but fun to visit with friends and get a snap.",
          "This is a monument that shows where the borders of Switzerland, France, and Germany meet. The monument itself isn't a huge deal, but the walk there from the city center is a really nice walk through the Port of Basel and it's surrounding areas, and going here on a nice day would",
          "Unless you're utterly captivated by the idea of taking a photo of a metal sculpture pointing out an industrial corner of the world where Switzerland, Germany, and France meet -- skip it.",
          "Located down by the city\u2019s river port basins and adjacent to the river proper, this tri-country corner is mainly worth visiting in summer for a pleasant atmosphere by the riverside. You can watch the barges and pleasure craft sail past or board a river cruise vessel there \u2013",
          "We read about Dreilaendereck (3 countries corner) where France & Germany & Switzerland meet and wanted to go there while we were staying in Basel. Fortunately we were with someone who knew right where it was & how to get there. We first took a tram & then walked about 15 - 20"

        "wiki": "The Museum of Cultures in Basel (German: Museum der Kulturen Basel) is a Swiss museum of ethnography with large and important collections of artifacts, especially from Europe, the South Pacific, Mesoamerica, Tibet, and Bali. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.\n\n\n== History ==\nBoth the Museum of Cultures and the Natural History Museum Basel trace their origins to the 1840s, when the city of Basel founded its Museum of Natural History and Ethnography to house artifacts and artworks collected by merchants and travelers. \nIn 1849, the museum moved into a large neoclassical edifice designed by Melchior Berri and located on the M\u00fcnster hill at the heart of Basel, on the site of a former Augustinian monastery. In 1904 the museum created a separate ethnology department (Abteilung f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde), and in 1917 the ethnographic collection became an independent institution inside the same building as the Natural History Museum. \nIn the early 20th century, the Ethnographic Museum Basel began sponsoring expeditions to enhance its collections. In 1944 the museum was renamed the \"Museum of Ethnology and Swiss Museum of Folklore\" (Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde und Schweizerisches Museum f\u00fcr Volkskunde) to reflect its dual mission of documenting local as well as \"foreign\" cultures. Over time the museum shifted its focus to the promotion of intercultural dialog, leading to its official renaming in 1996 as the Museum of Cultures.\n\n\n== Collections and exhibitions ==\nIn 1844 the museum, still without a permanent home, received hundreds of ancient Mexican ceramics and statues collected by Lukas Vischer of Basel. It remains one of the most notable European collections of ancient American art. Recent exhibitions on Bhutan (1998), Tibet (2001), and Bali (2002) have highlighted the museum's exceptional Asian and Oceanian collections.\nWith about 300,000 objects and a similar number of historic photographs, the museum is the largest of its kind in Switzerland and one of the biggest in Europe. It also serves the canton of Basel-City by documenting and preserving the local cultural legacy. A 1999 exhibition was devoted to Basel's unique Carnival (Fasnacht) tradition, and the 2005 \"Festivals of Light\" exhibition explored the city's religious diversity.\nThe museum's most recent exhibitions have emphasized intercultural comparisons and dialog. The 2007\u20132008 exhibition \"Red: Hot on the Trail of a Color\" drew on all of the museum's resources to explore the significance of red in human societies.\n\n\n== Renovation ==\nIn 2008, the museum opened a new main entrance on the M\u00fcnsterplatz, making the museum more accessible and giving it a clearly distinct identity from the Museum of Natural History. The museum plans to further expand its exhibition space. These plans are on hold to allow for a thorough archaeological investigation of the museum courtyard. As of July 2008 investigators had found evidence of late Roman settlement on the site.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMuseums in  Basel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuseum of Cultures Basel\nBasel museums website",

        "wiki": "Vitra is a Swiss family-owned furniture company with headquarters in Birsfelden, Switzerland. It is the manufacturer of the works of many internationally renowned furniture designers. Vitra is also known for the works of notable architects that make up its premises in Weil am Rhein, Germany, in particular the Vitra Design Museum.\n\n\n== History and corporate architecture ==\n\nVitra \u2013 founded by Willi and Erika Fehlbaum, the owner of a shopfitting business \u2013 entered the furniture market in 1957 with the licensed production of furniture from the Herman Miller Collection for the European market - primarily designs by Charles and Ray Eames and George Nelson. In 1967 the company introduced the Panton Chair by Verner Panton \u2013 the first cantilever chair out of plastic. In 1977 Rolf Fehlbaum took over the management of Vitra. In 1984 the partnership that had been formed with Herman Miller was terminated by mutual consent. Subsequently, Vitra obtained the rights to designs by Charles and Ray Eames and George Nelson for Europe and the Middle East.\nToday, Vitra's product line consists of designer furniture for use in offices, homes and public areas. In 2002, the company took in the realm of domestic living. Launched in 2004, the Home Collection includes classic furniture design pieces by Charles and Ray Eames, George Nelson, Verner Panton, Alexander Girard and Jean Prouv\u00e9, as well as the works of designers such as Antonio Citterio, Jasper Morrison, Alberto Meda, Maarten van Severen, Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, Hella Jongerius and BarberOsgerby.\nAfter a major fire destroyed a large part of the Vitra production facilities in Weil am Rhein in 1981, British architect Nicholas Grimshaw was commissioned to design new factory buildings and develop a master plan for the company premises. Inspired by his acquaintance with Frank Gehry in the mid-1980s, however, Vitra departed from Grimshaw\u2019s plan for a unified corporate project. Since that time, buildings have been erected on the Vitra grounds in Weil am Rhein by a wide ranging group of architects, including Frank Gehry (Vitra Design Museum and Factory Building, 1989), Zaha Hadid (Fire Station, 1993), Tadao Ando (Conference Pavilion, 1993), Alvaro Siza (Factory Building, Passage Cover, Car Parking, 1994), Herzog & de Meuron (VitraHaus, 2010), and SANAA (Factory Building, 2011).\nOver the years, Vitra accumulated a growing collection of chairs and other furniture. With the aim of making the collection accessible to the public, a museum was established as an independent foundation dedicated to the research and popularization of design and architecture. The Vitra Design Museum from 1989 by Frank Gehry was the first public building on the campus as well as the architect's first building in Europe. Today the museum is partly based on the own broad collection of 20th century furniture as well as host of visiting exhibitions.\nThe fire station by Zaha Hadid was the first completed building by the Iraqi architect. The building consists of a garage for fire engines, showers and locker rooms for the fire fighters and a conference room with kitchen facilities. The Fire Station is a sculpture of cast in-situ concrete that contrasts with the orthogonal order of the adjacent factory buildings like the frozen image of an explosion in a photograph. Today the building functions as an exhibition space.\nIn the same year, a conference pavilion of Japanese architect Tadao Ando was also constructed on the Vitra grounds. It was Ando's first work outside Japan. The calm and restrained structure encompasses an assortment of conference rooms. It is characterized by a highly ordered spatial articulation with a large part of its volume concealed below grade. A striking feature is the footpath leading to the pavilion, which has a significant association with meditation paths in the gardens of Japanese monasteries.\nIn the year 2000, the Campus was augmented with the addition of the Dome: a lightweight geodesic structure after Richard Buckminster Fuller, which was developed by T.C. Howard at Charter Industries in 1975 and transplanted from its original location in Detroit, USA, to Weil am Rhein. It is currently used as a space for events. In 2003, a petrol station by the French designer Jean Prouv\u00e9 - originally constructed in 1953 - was moved to the Vitra Campus.\nThe VitraHaus by Herzog & de Meuron, the latest addition to the Vitra Campus, opened in 2010 as the company's flagship store and home of the Vitra Home Collection. The concept of the VitraHaus connects two themes that appear repeatedly in the oeuvre of the Basel-based architects: the theme of the archetypal house and the theme of stacked volumes.\nIn June 2014 the Vitra Slide Tower was inaugurated.\n\n\n== Awards and projects ==\nVitra's products have received numerous design-related awards by international organizations. Vitra products have been used in numerous high-profile settings, including the plenary chamber of the German Bundestag, the Tate Modern in London, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, Deutsche Bank headquarters in Frankfurt, Novartis in Basel, Dubai International Airport or the Munich International Airport.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nThe company's website lists national subsidiaries in Austria, Belgium, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States. Vitra also has showrooms in numerous international cities. Production sites are located in Weil am Rhein (Germany), Neuenburg (Germany), Allentown (United States), Zhuhai (China) and Goka (Japan).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nRolf Fehlbaum\nVitra Design Museum\n\n\n== References ==\n\nHistory section, company website\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Vitra (furniture) at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial site",

          "We loved our visit to the Vitracomplex, especially the Vitra house from Herzog. It's a very special showroom of the Vitraproducts with shop and restaurant in a beautiful building. The impressive museumbuilding from Gehry itself is situated on the same grounds. I have to say we",
          "It is really worth the Architecture tour as Vitra it is not just a museum it is also an Architecture Experience. For those who love architecture I would recomend them without any doubt this tour.",
          "The Vitra Campus Architecture is the right place for design fanatics. We started from the VitraHaus, free admission, where each room is an amazing space where design and architecture are melted together. A big window gives natural light inside each room and you can see the nice",
          "The Vitra Haus was a wondeful visit. You get plenty of design ideas, and the place is very enjoyable. However I found the museum boring and too expensive. My suggestion is to stick to the VitraHaus and its shop.",
          "Really interesting place. Not only chairs but architecture also very interesting. Also good spot to visit with children.",
          "I visited the Vitra Design Museum to see the Bauhaus exhibition, but I thought that the building's architecture was stunning. Every room in the museum is a new experience. Light seems to pour in from everywhere. I realize now I should have taken the tour as that would have",
          "We liked the spacious shop/house where you can get a good idea about everything. The museum comes with an entrance fee and we found the museum not that interesting.",
          "I would recommend the guided tour which is around two hours but seems shorter and is good value. It's mostly outside so bear this in mind if it's rainy or cold. The Vitra house is probably the highlight. You can take the lift to the top floor and work your way down. The caf\u00e9 is",

          "The place is so renowned that doesn't need another praise. Everyone who has a slight interest in design and then possesses good taste should go and visit it. Highly recommended is the architecture tour inside the Vitra factory and a visit at the VitraHaus, the flagship store.",

          "When I told a relative I was going to Basel she wrote back that I must visit the Vitra museum. That's what I did, and indeed it was a special place. An easy bus ride outside of town. Some might consider it jsut a sophisticated marketing ploy - and there is some of that - but",
          "I waited for a long time to visit this museum and the vitra campus. It was very impressive. The Alvar Aalto exhibition was very good and the architecture tour was amazing. Our guide, Frau Manling was awesome. The visit around the campus was so good. Loved it.",

          "the guided tour is available at certain time, which make you have the chance to go inside of these amazing buildings. though the guide is a serious lady, she is more like a artist and knowledgable for many fields. the restaurant is a nice stay for the food or a casual coffee.",

          "great factory tours and design museum, shop and Cafe. For anybody who loves modernist furniture design this place is an absolute Must!",
          "This is a museum one visits not because of what is on display (nothing special when we were there, just lots of chairs) but because of the buildings. This is one of Frank Gehry's earlier works, 25 years old and still astonishingly modern. Walk around and look at all the amazing",

        "wiki": "The Beyeler Foundation or Fondation Beyeler with its museum in Riehen, near Basel, owns and oversees the art collection of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler.\n\n\n== History ==\nArt dealers Ernst Beyeler (16 July 1921 \u2013 25 February 2010) and Hilda Kunz (1922 - 18 July 2008), known as Hildy, created the Beyeler Foundation in 1982 and commissioned Renzo Piano to design a museum to house their private collection. The collection was first publicly exhibited in its entirety at the Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid in 1989, and was subsequently shown at Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin in 1993 and the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney in 1997.By building Renzo Piano's museum structure in 1997, the Beyeler Foundation made its collection permanently accessible to the public. The museum is properly funded, and it receives annual grants from the cantons of Basel City and Basel County and the commune of Riehen.\nMajor partners of the Foundation are Bayer AG, Novartis and Swiss bank UBS.In 2006, approximately 340,000 persons visited the museum. The number of visitors in 2016 was 332,000.\n\n\n== Collection and exhibitions ==\n\nThe Beyeler Foundation opened its doors on 18 October 1997, presenting 140 works of modern classics, including 23 Picassos. The overall collection of 200 works of classic modernism reflect the views of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler on 20th-century art and highlight features typical of the period from Claude Monet, Paul C\u00e9zanne and Vincent van Gogh to Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Francis Bacon (artist). The paintings appear alongside some 25 objects of tribal art from Africa, Oceania and Alaska. A third of the exhibition space is reserved for special exhibitions staged to complement the permanent collection. \nThe culmination of Beyeler's career came in 2007 when all the works that passed through his hands were reunited at the museum for a grand exhibition that included van Gogh's 1889 Portrait of Postman Roulin, Lichtenstein's Plus and Minus III and a huge expressive drip painting by Jackson Pollock. The collection is expanding, particularly in terms of works made after 1950 (recent acquisitions include pieces by Louise Bourgeois and Wolfgang Tillmans).The garden surrounding the museum also periodically serves as a venue for special exhibitions. In a work called \"Wrapped Trees\", Christo and Jeanne-Claude veiled 178 trees in the park around the Beyeler Foundation and in the adjacent Berower Park between 13 November and 14 December 1998.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nEmbedded in the Berowerpark in the Basel suburb of Riehen, the building features a glazed fa\u00e7ade largely looking out onto the corn fields and vines covering the T\u00fcllinger Hills. The two perimeter walls of the original garden site inspired the idea of the museum\u2019s layout. Four 115-metre (377 ft) long supporting porphyry walls running from north to south and standing 7 metres (23 ft) apart define the plan of the building. Resting on top of the solid foundation walls, the lightweight glass roof, white enamelled on the reverse, admits northern light but screens off light from the east and the west. Along the northern and the southern sides the roof projects far beyond the walls, shading the glass fa\u00e7ades from the sun. In 1999, less than two years after the opening of the museum edifice, the building was lengthened by 12 metres (39 ft), which increased total exhibition space by 458 square metres (4,930 sq ft) to its present (as of April 2020) 3,764 square metres (40,520 sq ft).\nSituated vis-\u00e0-vis the museum building, the late-Baroque Villa Berower houses the museum's administration department and a restaurant.\n\n\n== Partners and sponsors ==\n\n\n=== Public Sponsors ===\nSwiss Confederation\nMunicipality of Riehen\nCanton of Basel\n\n\n=== Major Partners ===\nBayer\nNovartis\nUBS\n\n\n=== Partners ===\naccurART\nBasler Kantonalbank\nFondation BNP Paribas\nRolls-Royce Motor Cars\nISS Facility Services\nJ.

          "Great museum experience & wonderful selection of works. It is a bit of a Covid-museum with way too many visitors. despite the fact that everyone has to wear a mask, there are no restrictions on distance between people. Still a great visit in a perfectly well kept location.",
          "Great museum.  Edward Hopper exhibition is super.  Such a relaxing park-like atmosphere",
          "Was not only thrilled by the location and building itself but how it\u2019s been managed in though COVID-times: visiting slots might be reserved online in advance - however, there are tickets available on the spot as well if accept a little waiting time (which you might want to enjoy in the restaurant located on location ;-)",
          "The Fondation Beyeler is an astounding place to visit. A worth-to-visit-place with collection of immersive and phenomenal artworks surrounded by a nice garden. Enjoy the beautiful art and uniqueness that is shown.",
          "We had to take two different trams to the Fondation Beyeler, but it seems easier than getting a cab.\n\nThis place has one of the best Picasso exhibitions I\u2019ve ever seen!\n\nIt was beautifully presented and audio guides gave a great insight to \u2026",
          "The Hopper exhibition was great in terms of the selection of artwork, but it was a shame that the curation was very weak. There was no meaningful information or clear organisation of the spaces to allow a deeper engagement with the artwork \u2026",
          "Cool museum, cool staff, I really like the taste of the exposition but I think about this topic it really depends on what they are exposing. But what I liked from the time I visit was that it felt in motion and alive. They also had a place for you to interact with and collaborate with other people to create art that was very cool.",
          "Lovely permanent collection of some of the key modern painters set in serene and thought provoking surroundings.",
          "Much needed relief after being disappointed that most other places on Basel are closed on Mondays. Glad in a way, as I wouldn't have come otherwise. Fabulous gallery. The Hopper exhibition was quite brilliant. Worth the tram ride of the city. Would visit again.",
          "Whenever I go to this museum, I m very happy to visit. Very nice garden and nice building. Parking lot is not big enough for visiter. Better to go by public transportation especially on the weekend.",
          "Always interesting to come back.",
          "Very interesting! Young people and students enter for free",
          "I've now been to Fondation Beyeler twice and it's amazing. First of all, it's free for everyone under the age of 25.\nSecond, the exhibits are just insane. They bring paintings from all over the world, at least they did so for the big \u2026",
          "Excellent place for art, great Copeland exhibitions. The only problem for me in particular is, that the reduction for people with Handicap card is very very small, almost nothing. Nothing to do with France, where all museums and private foundations  are much more friendly with handicapped persons.",
          "The most beautiful museum in Switzerland if not in the world, all due to its many very interesting exhibitions. Was there for Resonating Space exhibition and it was just breathtaking!",
          "Special price for students from 25-30 years old, very organized and clean exhibition space but not a big collection.",
          "Wonderful Hopper exhibition, and terrific space for the permanent residents such as Piccaso, Warhole, Monet and many others..",
          "Did someone say Picasso Collective? How about Monet? This museum has hosted some of the greatest artwork ever to grace the modern world. This place is a treasure. I\u2019ve seen works of art I thought I would only dream about seeing. Accessible \u2026",
          "Pleasant, modern, airy exhibition rooms. Easy access by tram.",
          "A wonderful museum with amazing special exhibitions. Balthus was mesmerizing!",
          "Outstanding park, architecture and collection!\n\nHopper exhibition - at least over a weekend - a let down. Hopper\u2019s solitary work calls for tranquility. One needs room to maneuvre, quiet, pieceful moments to indulge. That is what the movie of the exhibition tries to convey, that is not possible. Dommage",
          "World class! Absolutely fantastic works of the masters on permanent display, but I happened to catch \u201cThe Young Picasso\u201d and it was absolutely brilliant! Students get a discount, however, if you happen to be a returning student and over 30, \u2026",
          "I saw the Edward Hopper show. It's very, very good.",
          "Not an art expert but you can find here works from world renowned artists such as Picasso, Degas, Cezanne, etc together with some contemporary art without suffering huge crowds.",
          "One of my favourite galleries in the world. Great selection of temporary works and fantastic permanent collection. The entire light concept is fascinating, filtering natural light from the ceiling onto the artworks. The Fondation\u2019s gardens \u2026",
          "Amazing art Gallery. I spent 2 hours here and loved the experience.",
          "We had a guide take us since we are artstudents. The guide was very professional and the gallery was enchanting",
          "Very nice modern museum. The entrance under 25 is free.",
          "Great space, Edward Hopper -exhibit was nice. Admission price is a bit steep but worth it.",
          "Impressive collection of art. Look for a time to go when they have special exhibitions. It's worth the wait.",
          "It has a beautiful park for just hanging out. The exhibitions are intrtesting and inspiring. I recommend visiting this place if you are in the vicinity.",
          "Awesome venue, Renzo Paino Building is amazing and the exhibition was so great!!",
          "We found today the time to visit the excellent Hopper exhibition. Even though the museum is a place of true inspiration, families seem not to be welcome warmly. My wife and my kids walked in the exhibition halls of the foundation Beyeler \u2026",
          "Beautiful building, the breathtaking Monet alone, is worth the visit.",
          "Beautiful building and grounds. Some very nice paintings by Pissaro, Picasso, etc.",
          "It's a great place to relax and enjoy some art\u2013the collection is astonishing and it includes all of major 20th century artists! The temporary exhibitions are always presented with thought and care and tend to bring the best out of the art! They're always thought out conceptually very well!",
          "The best place ever for captivating, beautiful, stunning art exhibitions.",
          "Beautiful art and building. Wonderful place.",
          "Fantastic, both as place and for the exhibitions. It is a relaxing and fascinating cultural center, where the beauty of the arts bring a whisper of happiness in this life. It is maybe a bit expensive, but it worth every cent.",
          "Always an interesting art event",
          "Visited the second exhibition just now (Picasso) and it was a amazingly well curated as the first one (Balthus) I saw. Paired with the beautiful grounds and architecturally interesting exhibition hall it's well worth a visit. However, it is rather expensive and parking could be better.",
          "Nice museum, lots of greenery Outdoors to enjoy a sandwich and watch the museum, small inside but high ceilings and cool exhibitions, always has great room text or the booklet to explain some of the pieces, you can also rent an audio guide.",
          "Great variety of all types of art. Somewhat stuffy attitude. Half off with Basel Pass given by every Hotel in Basel. Right on tram line.",
          "I visited for the Picasso and Rudolf Stingel exhibition. If you\u2019re visiting Basel consider Fondation Beyeler.",

          "Loved the art collection and the beautiful gardens surrounding the museum. Tranquil and peaceful",
          "Very good ambience and pretty moderate Sammlung. It has a few Class Monet pieces but those are the lower end of that specific series. Those who visit museums can make it out easily. This is a conceptual place- with loads of openness , urban \u2026",
          "Amazing museum with painting from the world's best painters.",
          "Had a great time on a party here",
          "Unique architecture and atmosphere created by Renzo Piano, great selection of high quality artworks in the collection and blue chips contemporary artists. Organization of interesting musical events in the garden during summer",
          "Excellent art exhibition centre where the landscape of the beautiful garden outside is in dialogue with the collection shown internally of contemporary art or impressionism.",
          "Reasonably good collection. Impressed by blue and red period retrospective of Picasso's work, but explanations not very detailed considering Beyeler apparently knew Picasso. Still very much worth the visit. Nice basement cafe,but price \u2026",
          "Amazing work shown tastefully and thoughtfully throughout the museum. The colors, aesthetics and a modern feel helps you zero in on the artwork. Coming from NY I thought it was one of my favorite museum experiences. Will visit again!",
          "Excellent. Great exhibition. And very friendly to people was mobility issues.",
          "The Picasso exhibition was excellent. We used audio guides for further insight. The late afternoon sun in the building and gardens gives the whole place a  special feeling.",
          "I would rate this among the top attraction in Basel if you have even a moderate amount of interest in Modern Art. The architecture of the building is interesting and the grounds of the campus are also beautiful. The ticket is moderately \u2026",

          "The building, the Garden-superb. Natural light on Picasso paintings! Excellent.",

          "Fondation Beyeler is one of my favourite art spaces in the region. The Gallery is much bigger than what it appears from the outside. Wonderful setting - the outside space somehow becomes part of the inside experience thanks to the huge glass windows. Very interesting",

          "The Fondation Beyler is one of the two important art museums in Basel, the other one being the Kunstmuseum. It offers regular top class exhibitions, presently \"Degas\". Apart from changing exhibitions, there is an own exceptional exhibition part, that can be visited permanentely.",
          "I really enjoyed this museum. As a private museum, its' admission fee is NOT included in the Swiss Rail Pass discounts, but well worth the 25CHF. When I was there in July, the main exhibit was Jeff Koons' work and included his porcelain pieces, fascination with vacuums, steel",

          "As noted elsewhere, there is easy access to this quite lovely Renzo Piano building from the #6 tram from Basel. The permanent collection is quite good, but only a few rooms of it were being shown when we were there, since most of the building was being devoted to a very large",

          "The garden setting for the renzo piano building is wonderful.the audio guide to the degas exhibition is well spoken and enjoyably informative without being too dry or repetitive.but why no audio guide for the main displays? The #6 tram stops right outside and you just have to",

          "Not only are the exhibits excellent, but also the place in itself is worth the trip. It is surrounded by gardens, and in good weather, it's wonderful to sit outside of their restaurant and admire the artworks that are very often placed outside. It's just a delight. The latest",
          "we loved the Jeff Koons exhibit, and never tire of the permanent one. Don't miss it, it is really worth the trip do Basel. Also, plan to have lunch in the Restaurant on the Foundation's grounds: we had a delicious chicken salad, asparagus risotto and pasta",

          "A visit to this museum is extremely expensive, no free parking in proximity and the nearby parking house fee is hight too. Yes it is a nice building it has a nice garden and exhibits great art. But it has also ridiculous security rules, for ex. no handbags/bags allowed but as a",

          "I've been to the Beyeler about 5 times now, and each time I'm impressed. That this tiny institution amasses such incredible works of art for its shows is incredible. The current Surrealism in Paris exhibit is particularly awe inspiring, with some of the world's most famous",
          "If you love art or architecture, don't miss an opportunity to visit the Beyeler Foundation in Basel (in Riehen, actually, but it's basically part of Basel in a very nice residential suburb). Even if it is not your favorite artist on display, you will enjoy the beautiful garden",

        "wiki": "The Basel museums encompass a series of museums in the city of Basel, Switzerland, and the neighboring region. They represent a broad spectrum of collections with a marked concentration in the fine arts and house numerous holdings of international significance. With at least three dozen institutions, not including the local history collections in the surrounding communities, the region offers an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other metropolitan areas of similar size. They draw some one and a half million visitors annually.\nConstituting an essential and defining component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museums of the canton of Basel-City arose from the 1661 purchase of the private Amerbach Cabinet by the city and the University of Basel and thus represent the oldest civic museum collection in continuous existence. Since the 1980s, a number of collections have been made public in new purpose-built structures that have achieved renown as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.\n\n\n== Museum landscape ==\nThe main focus of collecting among Basel museums is the fine arts \u2013 painting, drawing and sculpture. More than a dozen museums cover a spectrum that extends from antiquity up to the present and includes historic and established works of art as well as pioneering creations. In particular, the latter category has been made increasingly accessible to the public over the past two decades in a series of newly opened museums. There are collections with more of a local and regional character, yet a number of area museums, especially the larger institutions, are noted for their international orientation and reach. In addition, Basel benefits from a long tradition of collecting that, in contrast to many other museums in Central Europe, was not disrupted by the wars of the 20th century, as well as from the city's well-established connections to the market of art dealers and art collectors \u2013 such as through Art Basel.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nNumerous museums address various themes of cultural history and ethnology while other institutions feature technical and scientific collections. The museums continue to be oriented to the scholarly tasks of collecting, conserving and exhibiting as well as research and education or at least view these as part of their activities. Consistent with museological trends seen elsewhere, however, the traditional self-image has evolved since the 1960s. Alongside the new forms of public outreach (museum education and didactics), institutional hybrid forms have arisen that actively embrace a sociopolitically relevant role and in which museum operations constitute just one facet, albeit a highly important one, of a more comprehensive cultural institution.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWith the city's position at the junction of the \"Dreil\u00e4ndereck\" (Three-Countries Corner) and the compact municipal boundaries within the Basel region, most of Basel's museums are located in the city of Basel and thus in the canton of Basel-City but quite a few of museums lie in the canton of Basel-Country. The Basel museum landscape can also be said to extend to the museums of the greater metropolitan area, such as those in the neighboring towns of L\u00f6rrach, Saint-Louis and Weil am Rhein, with the latter included in the annual Basel Museum Night through the participation of Vitra Design Museum in Weil. In view of the numerous municipal, regional and national administrative units that come together here as well as the broader agglomeration, it is difficult to produce a conclusive figure for the number of Basel museums. Yet even when taking a narrowly drawn perimeter, the total comes to at least three dozen institutions that house collections and make them accessible to the public. The Basel museums are also part of the German-French-Swiss \"Upper Rhine Museum Pass\" that was introduced in 1999. This covers a much wider area than the Basel region, however, extending via Strasbourg up to Mannheim.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWith the increasing aestheticization of everyday life, the architecture of museums has taken on special significance since the 1980s. A striking number of exhibition structures have incorporated a vocabulary of postmodern and deconstructivist forms. In and around Basel, new buildings, additions or renovations have been constructed from designs by nationally and internationally renowned architects (Renzo Piano, Zaha Hadid, Frank O. Gehry, Wilfried and Katharina Steib, Herzog & de Meuron, Mario Botta) and celebrated as examples of avant-garde museum architecture. In other area museums, by contrast, the building fabric is old to very old, consisting of former residential and commercial buildings or monasteries and churches that have been converted for exhibition purposes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe museums are a central aspect of Basel's touristic appeal and hence an important economic factor. A number of Basel's museums are public institutions but the majority are privately sponsored, backed in most cases by foundations. Helping to generate the high density of museums compared to other cities and metropolitan areas of similar size, these private collections have also made a substantial contribution to the high level of museum quality. The private collections nearly all came into being after the Second World War. Most of the public museums, by contrast, date from before the war. In fact, the collections of the five publicly run museums of the canton of Basel-City have histories that go back several centuries.\n\n\n== Development of the museums ==\n\n\n=== Museums in the city ===\n\n\n==== Early collections ====\n\nThe origins of the first public collection are closely linked to the University of Basel and the early modern era collections of books, art and natural curiosities, of which there were quite a few in Basel. Prominent among them, the Amerbach printer family (founded by Johann Amerbach) had collected a substantial number of books, paintings, goldsmith works, coins and natural objects during the 16th century. In 1661, the Amerbach Cabinet was on the verge of being disbanded following a purchase offer from Amsterdam, then the European center for the trade in collector's items. At the urging of the mayor Johann Rudolf Wettstein, the city and university decided to jointly purchase the collection in order to keep it in Basel. Installed in the Haus zur M\u00fccke just off Cathedral Square in 1671, the collection did not operate like a museum. It principally served as a library for university scholars, with only a few parlors on the first floor reserved for works of art and natural objects. Two librarians were in charge of administering the overall collection.\n\nBeginning in the late 18th century, Basel saw an acceleration in the growth of collections of books and objects inspired by Enlightenment-era ideals of education and refinement. Significant holdings of antiquities, coins, fossils and natural curiosities made their way into the Haus zur M\u00fccke through purchases, gifts or bequests by private collectors. An especially important addition came in 1823 with the contents of the Museum Faesch, a Basel collection from the 17th century. The first coherent ethnological collection was formed from the \"Mexican cabinet\" that had been assembled by the merchant Lukas Vischer from 1828 to 1837 during his travels in Central America. In 1821, the natural objects and artifacts were separated out from the collections in the Haus zur M\u00fccke and an independent museum of natural history was established at the Falkensteiner Hof, likewise located right off Cathedral Square, which also included the instrument cabinets of the physics and chemistry institutes.The city's official repository for art was the Basel Town Hall (Rathaus) whose rich ornamentation and upkeep represented a constant undertaking for the city and a source of commissions for numerous artists from the early 16th century onward. The city armory likely had a \"museum corner\" starting in the 16th century. Following common practice, weapons that had become unfit for war were decommissioned for disposal. In Basel, however, a substantial number of them were preserved, which means that the armory caretakers wished to store the obsolete medieval or early modern militaria for the sake of memory value. The most prominent examples were the real and supposed trophies of the Burgundian booty from 1476, which had fallen to Basel and remained on display to curious onlookers centuries later. In contrast, the care and storage of the Basel Cathedral Treasury that had lost its liturgical value in the Reformation did not bear the character of a museum. Locked away in the cathedral sacristy for three centuries, the reliquaries and other religious objects remained inaccessible and out of view until 1833 and were merely listed as book value in the state budgets.\n\n\n==== First museum building ====\n\nIn 1767, the university professor Johann Jakob d\u2019Annone had the paintings and other objects moved to the previously empty ground floor of the Haus zur M\u00fccke to create more space for the books on the first floor, and also provided for a more systematic organization. A few decades later, however, the building and its infrastructure no longer accommodated the increased volume of visitors (with the facility open four days of the week starting in 1829) and the modern culture of knowledge established through the Enlightenment. Moreover, a comprehensive index of the holdings was lacking, having been \"altogether impossible heretofore in the inadequate premises where some pieces lay buried in darkened recesses for decades beneath an inch-thick layer of dust.\"The need for space was resolved in 1849 with the removal of the collection to the multi-purpose building by Melchior Berri on Augustinergasse \u2013 simply named the \"Museum\" \u2013 on the site of the former Augustinian monastery. It was financed with a one-time contribution from the canton along with citizen donations. The late classicistic monumental edifice with decorative painting and frescoes by Arnold B\u00f6cklin is a comparatively early example of a civic museum and the first major museum in Basel. While taking clear inspiration from Karl Friedrich Schinkel and his Academy of Architecture in Berlin, the allocation of spaces and functions here combined university facilities with a library and natural history and art collections. This also served the institutional requirements of the university. Further examples of collections could be found in most of the subsidiary institutes \u2013 i.e., facilities with demonstration objects for instruction and research purposes. These included the instruments of the chemistry and physics institutes and the utensils of the anatomical institute.\n\n\n==== Division of the public collections into state museums ====\n \nParallel to the specialization of the educational and research disciplines that took hold at the beginning of the 19th century, Basel's wide-ranging holdings of objects evolved into institutional collections divided according to various scientific fields. They were very different from the cabinets of curiosities that, according to the Basel professor Wilhelm Wackernagel, had merely involved \"[mindless grabbing] at curiosities with a half-pedantic, half-childish zeal\". The Natural History Museum (Naturhistorisches Museum) founded in 1821 was the first step in this new direction. In 1836, the art collection was made legally independent from the university library with a separate publicly funded art commission to oversee it. In 1856, the \"medieval collection\" took up residence in auxiliary rooms and annexes of the Basel Cathedral (Bishop's Court, St. Nicholas Chapel), having been established earlier that year with inventories from the Museum on Augustinergasse based on the model of the German National Museum in Nuremberg. In 1887, castings of ancient sculptures were put on display in the Sculpture Hall of the Basel Art Association (Basler Kunstverein). Meanwhile, in 1874, the chemistry and physics institutes had moved into the new Bernoullianum building for the study of the natural sciences, whereupon their holdings of objects shed their collection character in favor of laboratory facilities. The canton had difficulty amassing funding and support for the creation of another museum for its collections. The Museum on Augustinergasse had represented a formidable beginning, yet remained the only one of its kind for nearly fifty years.\n\nIn 1892, the \"antiquarian collection\" (small artifacts of antiquity, excluding ethnological objects) was joined with the medieval collection of the Basel Cathedral and historical weapons from the Basel Armory to form the Historical Museum Basel (Historisches Museum Basel), with exhibition space in the reconverted Barf\u00fcsser Church from 1894 onwards. Today this museum houses the Upper Rhine's most comprehensive collection of cultural history, showing artisanal crafts (Cathedral Treasury, goldsmith works, stained glass) and objects of everyday culture (furnishings, tapestries, coin cabinet). Major emphasis is placed on the Late Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque periods. The entire inventory of books was incorporated into the collection of the new University Library in 1896. The \"ethnographic collection\", which was given the title Collection of Ethnology (Sammlung f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde) in 1905, moved into new space created by an addition to the Museum on Augustinergasse in 1917, where it became the Museum of Ethnology (Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde). With holdings of approximately 300,000 objects and a comparable number of historical photographs, it is the largest ethnological museum in Switzerland and one of the largest in Europe. The collection includes objects from Europe, Ancient Egypt, Africa, Asia (Tibet and Bali Collections), Ancient America and Oceania. In 1944, the federal administration distinguished its European holdings as the Swiss Museum of Ethnology (Schweizerisches Museum f\u00fcr Volkskunde). However, since 1997 this division no longer exists; non-European and European collections are now joined in the Basel Museum of Cultures (Museum der Kulturen Basel), whose name intentionally expresses a change in emphasis from the presentation of \u201cforeign\u201d cultures to intercultural dialogue. The Natural History Museum Basel (Naturhistorisches Museum Basel), which features most areas of the natural sciences (anthropology, mineralogy, paleontology, vertebrates, insects including the Frey Collection of Beetles and other invertebrates), has not only remained in its original location since 1849 but has also retained its traditional name. Its collections, comprising nearly eight million objects which are also dedicated to scientific research, bear the title \"Archives of Life\".\n\nThe public art collection was installed in the upper story of the Museum on Augustinergasse in 1849. Its continuing growth led to increasing spatial demands that could not be met at that location. In 1936, after a planning period of roughly three decades, the art collection moved into the Kunstmuseum Basel. Satellite locations had already been established in 1922 at the Augustinerhof on Augustinergasse (collection of prints and drawings) and at the Bachofenhaus on Cathedral Square (Bachofen Collection with additional holdings). The greater part of the art collection was temporarily housed in the Kunsthalle from 1928 until 1936. The Kunstmuseum's gallery of paintings and collection of prints and drawings comprise the largest and most significant public art collection in Switzerland. With an emphasis on paintings and drawings by artists of the Upper Rhine from 1400 to 1600 (Holbein family, Witz, Cranach the Elder, Gr\u00fcnewald) and art of the 19th to 21st centuries (B\u00f6cklin, van Gogh, C\u00e9zanne, Gauguin, Cubism with Picasso and Braque, German Expressionism, postwar American art), it also ranks as one of the leading international museums of its kind. Since the removal of the art collection to new quarters, the Museum on Augustinergasse has served as the exclusive domain of the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Cultures/Museum of Ethnology (V\u00f6lkerkundemuseum/Museum der Kulturen). A major expansion of the public museum collections occurred in 1961 with the founding of the Basel Museum of Ancient Art and Ludwig Collection (Antikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig). This new institution combined previous holdings from the Historical Museum (small artifacts of antiquity) and Kunstmuseum (sculptures) with acquisitions from private collections, which are displayed in two neoclassical villas located opposite the Kunstmuseum. The Museum of Ancient Art opened in the first villa in 1966 and expanded into the adjacent structure, also built by architect Melchior Berri, in 1988. It is the only Swiss museum devoted exclusively to the art of the Mediterranean area (mainly Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, Italic and Roman cultures, as well as Levante and the Near East) from the 4th millennium B.C. to the 7th century A.D. The collections of Greek vases, Antique sculptures and Ancient Egyptian artifacts occupy a central position within its holdings.\n\n\n==== Satellite locations of the state museums ====\n \nThe growing spatial needs of the collections that were housed in the Museum on Augustinergasse led to the incorporation of neighboring buildings. Similarly, the other museums also expanded. The Historical Museum in Barf\u00fcsser Church acquired the following satellite locations: the Museum of Domestic Life (Wohnmuseum) in the Segerhof (1926\u201334) and its successor in the Haus zum Kirschgarten since 1951, the Museum of Domestic Culture in Basel (Museum der Basler Wohnkultur); the Museum of Music (Musikmuseum), featuring five centuries of European musical history based on the musical instrument collection founded in 1943, which has been displayed since 2000 in the former prison Lohnhof; the carriage and sleigh collection in Br\u00fcglingen, established in 1981. Replica casts of ancient sculptures that were originally on display in the Sculpture Hall (Skulpturenhalle), but moved into storage in 1927 due to a lack of public interest, became part of the Museum of Ancient Art (Antikenmuseum) in 1961 and again received their own exhibition space in 1963 in the new Basel Sculpture Hall (Skulpturhalle Basel). It features the world's only complete reconstruction of architectural sculpture from the Parthenon in Athens. The Public Art Collection (\u00d6ffentliche Kunstsammlung) also expanded into a second building in 1981 with the Museum of Contemporary Art (Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwartskunst) in St. Alban-Tal. As the first public exhibition building project in Europe, it is devoted exclusively to the presentation of contemporary works and artistic production since 1960. In addition to classic media such as painting and sculpture, its acquisitions also include video art.\n\n\n==== Defunct and semi-public museums ====\n \nThe Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum) was founded in 1878 by the Society of Trades and Craftsmen as a forum for the presentation of local arts and crafts. It became a semi-public institution in 1886 before coming under full public sponsorship in 1914. Renamed the Museum of Design (Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung) in 1989 due to its broadening thematic spectrum, it was closed in 1996. Affected by the same cuts in public funding was the architecturally oriented City and Cathedral Museum (Stadt- und M\u00fcnstermuseum), established in 1939 under the auspices of the public agency for the preservation of historic monuments in the former convent of Kleines Klingental. The holdings of the Museum of Design were distributed among other institutions, with the transferral of its library and poster collection to the School of Design (Schule f\u00fcr Gestaltung). Thanks to the support of a foundation, the City and Cathedral Museum remains on the same premises under the present name Kleines Klingental Museum.\nThe Swiss Firefighting Museum (Schweizerisches Feuerwehrmuseum), founded in 1957 as the Basel Firefighting Museum, is housed on the premises of the cantonal Fire Brigade but does not have the status of a public museum and is not administered by the canton. Its collection, which includes permanent loans from the Historical Museum, features documents that date back to the 13th century. The H\u00f6rnli Cemetery Collection (Sammlung Friedhof H\u00f6rnli) operates under similar conditions: It has been located on the property of the canton's Central Cemetery since 1994 but is funded and run by a private association. On display are burial objects such as urns, documents on the history of cremation, hearses, coffins, cemetery regulations, graveyard crosses, glass pearl chains and memorial keepsakes.\n\n\n==== Additional museums ====\n\nThe first museum that was not supported and administered by the canton of Basel-City was established in 1860 in a large room at the Basel Mission. It presented ritual and cultural objects from the countries and ethnic groups among which the Basel Mission was active, as well as a portrait gallery of its missionaries. However, parts of this exhibit were later sold to the canton and the gallery space was closed. The concept of a multi-purpose building, following the example of the Museum on Augustinergasse, was embraced by the Basel Art Society (Basler Kunstverein), which erected the Kunsthalle on Steinenberg between 1869 and 1872. In addition to exhibition space and administrative offices, this building housed a library and studio space for sculptors. A building wing added in 1885 accommodated the Sculpture Hall (Skulpturhalle), where the previously mentioned casts of Antique statues from the Museum on Augustinergasse were displayed from 1886 to 1927. The former Artists House (K\u00fcnstlerhaus) now defines itself \u201cas a hub between artists and art agents and as a place that brings together local and international developments.\u201d The next privately initiated museum was the above-mentioned Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum); founded in 1878, it came under cantonal administration just eight years later. The Anatomical Museum (Anatomisches Museum) of the University of Basel dates back to the acquisitional activities of Carl Gustav Jung in the 1820s. As the Collection of Pathology and Anatomy (Pathologisch-Anatomische Sammlung), it moved into its own building in 1880. Two especially significant objects in this collection are the oldest anatomical specimen in the world (prepared by Andreas Vesalius in Basel in 1543) and a skeleton prepared by Felix Platter in 1573.The Museum of Pharmacy (Pharmazie-Historisches Museum, originally the Historical Apothecary Collection) followed in 1924 after the donation of a private collection to the University of Basel. It is one of the world's largest collections on the history of pharmacy, encompassing old pharmaceuticals and early apothecary objects, laboratory utensils, ceramics, instruments, books, arts and crafts. The Swiss Gymnastics and Sports Museum (Schweizerische Turn- und Sportmuseum), established in 1945, was renamed as the Swiss Sport Museum in 1977. Sponsored by a foundation (Stiftung Sportmuseum Schweiz), its major focus is on ball sports, cycling, gymnastics and winter sports. The shipping museum Transport Hub Switzerland (Verkehrsdrehscheibe Schweiz) emerged from a 1954 exhibition by the Swiss Shipping Company (Schweizerische Reederei) in the Rhine ports of Basel, entitled \u201cOur Path to the Sea.\u201d It is also supported and run by an association of private citizens. The Swiss Historical Paper Collection (Schweizerische Papierhistorische Sammlung) was an affiliate of the Museum of Ethnology (Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde) from 1954 to 1979 before moving into independent quarters in the Gallician Mill, located in the former industrial district of St. Alban, in 1980. Now known as the Swiss Museum for Paper, Writing and Printing (Schweizerisches Museum f\u00fcr Papier, Schrift und Druck), it is sponsored by the Basel Paper Mill Foundation (Stiftung Basler Papierm\u00fchle). The Jewish Museum of Switzerland (J\u00fcdisches Museum Schweiz), which presents the cultural history of Jews in Switzerland and in Basel including documents from the First Zionist Congress held in Basel in 1897, was founded by the Society for the Jewish Museum of Switzerland in 1966.\n\nLike the Kleines Klingental Museum, the Klingental Exhibition Gallery (Ausstellungsraum Klingental) is located in the building complex of the former Klingental convent. Opened in 1974, the gallery serves as a presentation platform for the current work of artists living in Basel and aims to support emerging artistic talents. It is sponsored by the Klingental Gallery Society (Verein Ausstellungsraum Klingental). The Caricature and Cartoon Museum Basel (Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel), by contrast, was initiated by an individual, the collector and patron Dieter Burckhardt. Founded in 1979, it is devoted to caricatures, cartoons, comics, parodies and pastiches. The eponymous foundation (Stiftung Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel) is a dependent affiliate of the Christoph Merian Foundation. The exhibition galleries have been located in a structure from the Late Gothic period since 1996, following the completion of renovations and a new building addition by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. The Swiss Architecture Museum (Schweizerisches Architekturmuseum), founded in 1984, has resided since 2004 in the building complex of the Kunsthalle, which was completely renovated and redesigned by the architectural offices Miller & Maranta and Peter M\u00e4rkli. The museum, sponsored by the Architecture Museum Foundation, presents alternating exhibitions on topics of international architecture and urbanism. An advantageous factor is the unusual concentration of internationally renowned architectural firms in Basel; Herzog & de Meuron, in particular, have made significant contributions to regional museum architecture.\nOpened in 1996, the Tinguely Museum features a permanent exhibition on the life and work of the artist Jean Tinguely. The museum's temporary exhibitions present works by friends and contemporaries of Tinguely, as well as other modern artists. Designed by Mario Botta, the museum is financed entirely by the Basel pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche. The Dollhouse Museum (Puppenhausmuseum) was founded in 1998 by its patron and owner Gigi Oeri, who built up the collection herself. In addition to dolls, dollhouses and miniature shops from the 19th and 20th century, it displays the world's largest collection of teddy bears. The media art space [plug.in] opened its doors in 2000 with the backing of the Forum for New Media Association (Verein Forum f\u00fcr neue Medien), which had been founded the previous year. It realizes exhibitions and projects, provides artists with international networking opportunities and helps convey works of media art to the general public. With one of the world's most extensive collections of photographs (around 300,000 works with an emphasis on industrial society in the 19th century), the Herzog Foundation has exhibited its holdings since 2002 in a \u201cLaboratory for Photography\u201d. Located in the Dreispitz industrial sector, the warehouse converted by Herzog & de Meuron encompasses the collection along with a reference library on the history of photography and two additional rooms for study, teaching and research purposes.\n\n\n=== Museums in surrounding communities ===\nMany of the small and mid-sized municipalities around Basel have museums of local history and culture that are not presented in the following. Mention is given to institutions whose scope extends beyond the local level and which are generally open to the public several days a week.\n\n\n==== Collections of natural, cultural and technological history ====\nThe oldest museum in the Basel region outside the city is the Museum of Canton Basel-Country (Museum des Kantons Basel-Landschaft) in Liestal, nowadays called Museum.BL. It was founded in 1837 as a \"Cabinet of Natural Curiosities\" (Naturaliencabinett) and up through the 1930s primarily took up objects of natural history into the collections. Since then, the emphasis has shifted toward cultural history. The diversity of the collection allows the museum to address wide-ranging themes related to the environment, history and the present day. The Museum am Burghof in L\u00f6rrach traces its origins to the L\u00f6rrach Antiquities Association (L\u00f6rracher Altertumsverein) founded in 1882, which bequeathed its collection to the town of L\u00f6rrach in 1927. Commencing operations in 1932 as the Museum of Local History (Heimatmuseum), the current permanent exhibition \u201cExpoTriRhena\u201d presents the history, present-day culture and divisions and similarities within the \"Dreil\u00e4ndereck\" (Three-Countries Corner) border region where Germany, France and Switzerland meet.\n\nOpened in 1957, the Roman Museum at Augst (R\u00f6mermuseum Augst) is an open-air museum on the grounds of the former Roman city of Augusta Raurica, which has been the subject of excavations going back to the Renaissance. The exhibits feature numerous archaeological finds, including the largest silver treasure from Late Antiquity. The adjacent reconstruction of a Roman House (R\u00f6merhaus) was a gift of the Basel patron Ren\u00e9 Clavel while the museum and the entire archaeological park constitute a departmental division of Basel-Country. Located in the Br\u00fcglinger Plateau, the Mill Museum (M\u00fchlemuseum) of the Christoph Merian Foundation is housed in the water mill of the former Br\u00fcglingen farming estate. The structure was converted into a museum in 1966 and presents the history of the mill and the work of millers from the Bronze Age up to the 20th century. The mill is still functional, allowing periodic demonstrations of the operational sequence from the water-powered mill wheel to the rotating millstone.\nOpened to the public in 1972, the Toy Museum and Village and Wine Cultivation Museum (Spielzeugmuseum, Dorf- und Rebbaumuseum) in Riehen complements its exhibits of village history and wine growing with one of the most significant collections of European toys. The toys are drawn from private collections as well as loans from the Museum of Cultures (Museum der Kulturen). The museum is operated as a division of the municipal administration of Riehen. The Museum of Music Automatons (Museum f\u00fcr Musikautomaten) in Seewen, located on the outermost periphery of the Basel museum territory, houses one of the world's largest and most well known collections of Swiss music boxes, disc music boxes, musical timepieces and jewelry and other mechanical musical automatons. It opened to the public in 1979 as a private museum of the collector Heinrich Weiss and was gifted to the Swiss Confederation in 1990. A newly remodeled and expanded facility for presentation of the exhibits was completed in 2000. Finally, the Museum of Electricity (Elektrizit\u00e4tsmuseum) of the electric utility Elektra Birseck opened its doors in M\u00fcnchenstein in 1997. Exhibits explore the history and development of power production and its use. The collection contains rare historic equipment and is complemented by a laboratory in which visitors can experiment with electric power.\n\n\n==== Emphasis on art collections ====\n\nSince the late 1980s, the Basel region has seen a proliferation of new museums addressing themes of art and design, especially concerning works from more recent years. The Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein presents a broad range of design topics, with a special emphasis on furniture and interior design. Though originally based on the private collection of chairs and other furniture assembled by Rolf Fehlbaum, the owner of the Vitra furniture company, the museum was established as an independent institution. The Vitra building complex has made notable contributions to the body of avant-garde architecture in the Basel region. In addition to the 1989 museum by Frank O. Gehry, the grounds feature structures by Zaha Hadid, Nicholas Grimshaw, Tadao Ando and \u00c1lvaro Siza. In 1982, the Beyeler Foundation assumed ownership of the art collection of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler, which the couple had built up over half a century. Since 1997, the works of classical modern art have been exhibited in a building designed by Renzo Piano in the town of Riehen. Featured artists include Degas, Monet, C\u00e9zanne, van Gogh, Picasso, Rothko, Warhol, Lichtenstein and Bacon. The trees in the park surrounding the highly acclaimed building were wrapped by Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1998.\n\nWith the creation of the Basel-Country Art Museum (Kunsthaus Baselland) in Muttenz, the Basel-Country Art Association (Kunstverein Baselland) was given its own dedicated exhibition building in 1997. The Art Museum is devoted to contemporary art and presents temporary exhibitions of current projects by regional and international artists. Opened in 1998, Riehen Art Space (Kunst Raum Riehen) is another public institution with a similar thematic orientation. It serves the municipality of Riehen and its art commission with exhibitions of contemporary works of art from the region. Established in 2001, the Sculpture at Schoenthal Foundation in the former Sch\u00f6nthal monastery presents over twenty works by international and Swiss artists in a permanently accessible sculpture park under the motto \u201cArt and Nature in Dialogue\u201d. A Romanesque-era church has been converted into a gallery for temporary exhibitions of contemporary artists. In 2003, the Schaulager (or \u201cviewing warehouse\u201d) of the Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation was opened in M\u00fcnchenstein. Centered on the avant-garde art collection of the foundation, the institute functions as a mix between public museum, art storage facility and art research institute. The polygonal building is a design by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. The Fernet Branca Contemporary Art Space (Espace d\u2019Art Contemporain Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, the Alsatian town just across the border from Basel, is located in the former Fernet-Branca spirits distillery that was decommissioned in 2000. Since 2004, the museum has presented temporary exhibitions on contemporary art themes and artists. The museum's operations are supported by the Association for the Fernet Branca Contemporary Art Museum (Association pour le Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Contemporain Fernet Branca).\n\n\n== Museum promotion and museum policy ==\n\n\n=== Primacy of the library ===\n\nMany museums can be traced back to courtly collections \u2013 at least in terms of the original set of holdings. Since the 19th century, in contrast, Basel has embraced a culture of remembrance of having created the oldest existing civic museum collection through its purchase of the Amerbach Cabinet in the year 1661. The acquisition of a collection from the 16th century fits with the historical and documentary interest in art that was prevalent at the time. In fact, however, the purchase was chiefly prompted by a desire to enhance the university's inventory of books with the extensive book holdings of the Amerbach Cabinet. The Haus zur M\u00fccke community hall that housed the university-administered collection was called the \u201cLibrary\u201d in recognition of its primary function. The role as the city's art repository did not shift from the Basel Town Hall (Rathaus) to the Haus zur M\u00fccke until the latter half of the 18th century. The Passion Altarpiece by Holbein that had been one of the main visitor attractions since the Reformation was moved over in 1770, followed by several additional paintings from the town council's inventories in 1771 and Holbein's organ doors from the Cathedral in 1786. Despite this weighting of the collections, the official legal status remained unchanged for quite some time. The natural history holdings and art collection were not split off from the library until 1821 and 1836, respectively.\nAt the end of the 18th century, civic museum culture was still in the early stages of its development, as illustrated by the very limited opening hours of the Haus zur M\u00fccke (Thursday afternoon from two to four in the afternoon, otherwise on request). The first records of regular gallery visits by city residents and outside visitors date to this period. In the three centuries before and after 1800, most of the collection activities involved objects of natural history, with a substantial number of acquisitions and gifts in this area. The numerous top-level art objects that made their way to Basel in the 1790s from Revolutionary France, on the other hand, did not find a wide audience of buyers and in most cases were resold.\n\n\n=== Transfer to the state and popular education ===\nFor the republican and monarchical civic states of the 19th century, collections in the form of public museums became emblems of self-determination. The carting off of large numbers of artworks to Paris during the Napoleonic Wars had created an awareness of the identity-shaping power of art. Institutional role models were the \u201cMus\u00e9e fran\u00e7ais\u201d in the Louvre and the \u201cMus\u00e9e des monuments fran\u00e7ais\u201d in a former Augustinian convent, which closed in 1816. The maintenance of programmatic museum collections and the construction of museum buildings became one of the most prominent and defining national functions.In the case of Basel, however, it was the increasing need for space in the Haus zur M\u00fccke that prompted deliberations regarding construction of a new building. The discussion concerning the right location for the public collection took on a political dimension following the division of the canton into city and regional sections. The University Act (Universit\u00e4tsgesetz) of 1818 had made the corporatively autonomous university a cantonal educational establishment, with the university holdings thus owned indirectly by the state. According to the arbitral decision governing the cantonal split, two-thirds of the university's collection belonged to the regional canton and had to be purchased by the city canton. The ensuing consternation in the city led to the Administration and Use of University Holdings Act (Gesetz \u00fcber Verwaltung und Verwendung des Universit\u00e4tsgutes) of 1836 that such goods were indissolubly tied to the locality of the city of Basel for the purposes of education. This provision has remained in effect to the present day.\n\nThese occurrences led to the founding of the Voluntary Academic Society of Basel (Freiwillige Akademische Gesellschaft) in 1835, which began supporting the collections in financial terms and through purchases and gifts as part of its general promotion of the university. Yet the greatest momentum for the museum building came from natural science circles centered on the physics and chemistry professor Peter Merian, who was likely responsible for securing a dedicated annual budget for the Natural History Museum \u2013 the only state collection with this distinction. A combination of academic institution, library and laboratories, the establishment of the Natural History Museum at the Falkensteiner Hof also provided a model for the museum building. The fact that a primary museum building was ultimately created instead of a university-affiliated building was due to the university's poor standing among wide sections of the merchant and industrialist classes. In these sectors, the university was considered a backward-looking institution. The museum, by contrast, was seen as a driving force for practical popular education and the community was willing to support its construction with private contributions as part of a wider process of renewal in the city.\n\nAt the instigation of Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein, the Voluntary Museum Association of Basel (Freiwilliger Museumsverein) was initiated in 1850 as the successor to an earlier association founded in 1841 for the construction of the museum. Modelled after the Royal Institution in London, it was established to \u201cstimulate the appreciation of science and art\u201d. Open to all residents of Basel, the association promoted the collections with financial means and sought to generate interest in the museum through public lectures to which women were also admitted. It was unable to sustain the initial enthusiasm, however, and experienced losses in membership despite Basel's rapid population growth in the latter half of the century. The museum did not embrace the function of popular education that had been promoted by its founders and supporters. The ideational socialization role of the museum was very slow to proceed, with the museum long holding onto former organizational structures. The art collection furthermore did not get an academically trained conservator until 1887. In addition, the renewed University Act of 1866 discontinued regular state appropriations for the antiquarian, medieval and art collections and left them dependent on proceeds from entry fees and the support of associations and private individuals, the most significant of these being the Birrmann Foundation and the Emilie Linder Foundation on behalf of the art collection. It was this support that enabled an active collection policy that went beyond the receipt of inherited cultural assets.\n\n\n=== Civic culture of remembrance and modernism ===\n\nFrom the outset, the museum authorities charged the collections with a federal mission, wanting them to exert a \u201cbeneficial and salutary influence on the entire Fatherland\u201d. The \u201cunofficial national gallery\u201d grew over time, primarily through acquisitions of Swiss works of art. When negotiations got underway in 1883 regarding the establishment of a federal museum, the canton of Basel-City sought to be chosen as the location for the new institution and proposed its collections of cultural history as the nucleus of the museum, systematically expanding them in light of its candidacy. While the Swiss National Museum (Schweizerisches Landesmuseum) ended up in Zurich, plans were nevertheless realized for a history museum that was no longer generally Swiss but specifically related to Basel, located in the historic former Barf\u00fcsser Church from the High Gothic period. The establishment of the Historical Museum \u201cwas a self-assured display of Basel\u2019s art-mindedness and craftsmanship, a mix of educational corridor and enfilade of stalls\u201d. The transfer of the Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum) to the state a few years earlier as an arena of contemporary achievements can likewise be seen under the aspect of civic pride and reinvented sense of commonality in which the citizenry understood its ideals and capabilities as a foundation of state and society.\n\nWhile the collections had clearly established their international standing, this appreciation did not become rooted in the cultural awareness of a broader range of social classes until the end of the 19th century. The historic culture of remembrance that was growing in importance and impact at the time was strongly linked with the medieval collection and the many Late Medieval and Renaissance works of the Upper Rhine in the Kunstmuseum. In the years since, Basel has also cultivated its claim of possessing the oldest municipal art collection in continuous existence through its acquisition of the Amerbach Cabinet. On the occasion of two major public celebrations in 1892 (500th anniversary of Greater Basel's acquisition of Lesser Basel) and 1901 (Basel's 400th anniversary as part of the Swiss Confederation), Basel presented the civically minded portion of the population (and hence the base of support for the museums) with a series of identity-shaping historical and patriotic gestures that borrowed from the store of images from the past available in the museums.\n[[File:Franz Marc-The Fate of the Animals-1913.jpg|thumb|Franz Marc: Animal Destinies, 1913. The painting was offered by the German Reich in 1939 as \u201cdegenerate art\u201d and purchased by the city of Basel.]]\nWith the epochal break of the First World War and in light of societal and cultural developments, the Basel museums became concerned with the citizenry's assertions of legitimacy and quest for recognition and their representation within these very same institutions. The discussions regarding the relationship of the museums to modernism took on particular relevance in the area of the fine arts. The construction of a dedicated museum for Basel's art collection ignited a \u201cmonumentality debate\u201d in the late 1920s, in which the proponents of functionally oriented New Building (Neues Bauen) rejected the timelessly classic palatial form that was ultimately chosen as a demonstration of power by a conservative and \u201cintellectually spent\u201d notion of culture. In contrast to the form of architectural expression and the general anti-modernistic spirit of the 1930s, the acquisitions from the 1920s up to the outbreak of the Second World War took a decisively modern tack. In 1934, the public art collection added its first painting by Vincent van Gogh along with an ensemble of 134 drawings by Paul C\u00e9zanne. Founded in 1933, the Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation supported the Kunstmuseum in these efforts and took up residence in the facility with its works of contemporary art in 1940. The breakthrough in altering the overall profile came with the special funding credit provided by the Basel-City parliament in 1939 at the instigation of museum director Georg Schmidt for the purchase of German museum holdings that the National Socialists had vilified as \u201cdegenerate art\u201d.\n\nThe establishment of classical modernism at the Kunstmuseum continued with ongoing acquisitions of postwar-era art, in particular with works by American artists. In Basel's claim to being a \u201cMuseum City\u201d, the highly controversial and unsuccessful referendum against the purchase of two Picasso paintings in 1967 holds considerable importance and constitutes a key moment in Basel's culture of remembrance in regard to the fusing of society and museum.\n\n\n=== Democratization, popularization ===\nDespite the affirmation by voters, traditional museums found themselves in a prolonged crisis beginning in the late 1960s. Not limited to Basel, this crisis originated in the profound sociopolitical reevaluation of culture of the era. The acquisitions of the State Art Credit and the 1967 Christmas exhibition at Kunsthalle Basel set off fierce protests among the loosely organized association of rejected artists, which became known as the Farnsburg Group (Farnsburgergruppe). Even the cantonal parliament got involved in addressing the concerns. The events raised the question of whether Basel was \u201cjust a museum city\u201d \u2013 here meant in a derogatory sense \u2013 and prompted a broadly cast debate over the fostering of young artists and the functioning of the museums. The establishment of the Klingental Exhibition Gallery (Ausstellungsraum Klingental) several years later was a direct consequence of the shortcomings that had been identified.\n\nThe democratization that took hold in the 1960s meant doing away with the elite in favor of the egalitarian, dispelling fears of the new and unknown. With a focus on the constructivist  works of the 1960s associated with the \u201cNew Tendencies\u201d (Nouvelles Tendances) movement, the short-lived Progressive Museum (1968\u20131974) set out to \u201cestablish a modern collection that would be accessible to the public from the very beginning\u201d and wanted to avoid any sort of \u201csecularized ceremony\u201d. The expansion of education and communication, likewise a mandate stemming from this era, could only be achieved through an increase in funding. Since the mid-1970s, however, increasingly tight budgets and persistent financial difficulties in the public sector have exerted a palpable impact on museums. The museum studies program at the University of Basel could only be offered from 1992 to 1994 due to funding shortages. In the mid-1990s, a government resolution cut the budget of the state museums by ten percent, leading to the 1996 closure of two museums, the Museum of Design (Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung) and the City and Cathedral Museum (Stadt- und M\u00fcnstermuseum). The ensuing debate and the pressure from a public referendum in support of the city's museums led to the adoption of the Basel-City Museums Act (Museumsgesetz) of 1999, which placed the holdings of the remaining five state museums (Museum of Ancient Art, Historical Museum, Kunstmuseum, Museum of Cultures, Natural History Museum) in the hands of the parliament. As a central component of cultural expenditures, the museums have also been included in the intensified negotiations over the past several years between the two Basel cantons regarding payment for the city-provided services within the framework of a fiscal equalization scheme.\n\nSince the 1980s, the museums have experienced simultaneous trends toward popularization and aestheticization. The ensuing decades have been marked by a wave of new museum buildings whose avant-garde architecture has achieved international prominence. Contributing considerably to popularization was the exhibition concept of the Mus\u00e9e Sentimental, which focuses on the world of un-prosaic everyday culture and experience and led to a 1989 exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Design (Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung). The annual Basel Museum Night tallies around a hundred thousand museum visits while the museums attract a total of approximately 1.4 million visitors throughout the year (as of 2006). The general population credits the museums with \u201ca leading role in providing leisure-time opportunities for education and learning\u201d. Museums operate in an environment that is increasingly subject to the conditions of both the leisure market and the free market, and are recognized as an important economic and locational factor. In contrast to the state, the use of private funds in the museum field has grown considerably. Funding from patrons or sponsors plays an increasingly significant role in the financing of exhibitions, parts of collections or entire museums and is thus highly sought after. This competitive situation is further reflected in the considerable institutional autonomy of the Basel-City museums, which are the only governmental enterprises in the canton operating under the private-sector influenced method of New Public Management.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nBirkner, Othmar; Rebsamen, Hanspeter (1986).

The river is marked by Rhine-kilometres 170 to 529 (the scale beginning in Konstanz and ending in Rotterdam).\nThe Upper Rhine is one of four sections of the river (the others being the High Rhine, Middle Rhine and Lower Rhine) between Lake Constance and the North Sea. The countries and states along the Upper Rhine are Switzerland, France (Alsace) and the German states of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse. The largest cities along the river are Basel, Mulhouse, Strasbourg, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Ludwigshafen and Mainz.\nThe Upper Rhine was straightened between 1817 and 1876 by Johann Gottfried Tulla and made navigable between 1928 and 1977. The Treaty of Versailles allows France to use the Upper Rhine for hydroelectricity in the Grand Canal d'Alsace.\nOn the left bank are the French region of Alsace and the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate; on the right bank are the German states of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse.  The first few kilometres are in the Swiss city of Basel.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nAround 35 million years ago, a rift valley of about 300 kilometres (190 mi) long and 50 kilometres (31 mi) wide came into being between the present cities of Basel and Frankfurt.  This was due to tensile stresses in the Earth's crust and mantle, which resulted in lowering the earth's surface.  The moat has been partially filled up again by sedimentation.  On the edges we find mountain ridges, the so-called \"rift flanks\".  On the eastern side, they are the Black Forest and Odenwald mountains, in the west the Vosges and Palatinate Forest.  During the Tertiary, the High Rhine continued west from Basel and flowed via the Doubs and the Sa\u00f4ne, into the Rh\u00f4ne.  The rift diverted the Rhine into the newly formed Upper Rhine Valley.\nThe Rhine knee at Basel marks the transition from the High Rhine to the Upper Rhine with a change of direction from West to North and a change of landscape from the relatively small-chamber high-Rhine cuesta landscape to the wide rift zone of the Upper Rhine Rift Valley.  The two largest tributaries come from the right: the Neckar in Mannheim, the Main across from Mainz.  In the northwest corner of the Upper Rhine Valley, at Rhine-kilometre 529.1, near Bingen, where the Nahe flows into the Rhine, the Rhine flows into a gorge in the Rhenish Massif and thereby changes into the Middle Rhine.\n\n\n== Straightening ==\nIn 1685, Louis XIV started a project to move the Upper Rhine, change its course and drain the floodplain, in order to gain land.  By 1840, the river had been moved up to 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) to the east, taking territory away from Baden.  Around 1790, large parts of the Rhine Valley were deforested, creating arable land, fields and pasture to feed the population.  The Upper Rhine was straightened between 1817 and 1876 by Johann Gottfried Tulla and changed from a relatively sluggish meandering river with major and many smaller branches into a fast flowing stream flanked by embankments.  The length of the Upper Rhine was reduced by 81 kilometres (50 mi).  Some cut-off river arms and ox-bows remain; they are typically called the Old Rhine (German: Altrhein) or Gie\u00dfen.\n\n\n== Canalising and dams ==\nThe Rhine between Basel and Iffezheim is almost entirely canalised.  On a stretch of 180 kilometres (110 mi), there are 10 dams, provided with hydropower stations and locks.  Between Basel and Breisach, the old river bed carries hardly any water; almost all water is diverted through the Grand Canal d'Alsace on the French side, to ensure safe shipping and hydropower generation around the clock.  Only when there is a large supply of water, then the old river bed will receive more water than the canal.  France gained the right to do this in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles; the right applies to the segment between Basel and Neuburgweier/Lauterbourg, where the Rhine forms the border between France and Germany.\nThe straightening (1817\u201376) and  channeling (1928\u201377) reduced the water table by up to 16 metres (52 ft) and thus had a negative effect on flora and fauna.  Gravel is also missing from the river, due to the dams.  This has caused erosion below the dam at Iffezheim.  To counter this, 173,000 cubic metres (6,100,000 cu ft) per year of a mixture of sand and gravel with an average grain diameter of 20 millimetres (0.79 in) (corresponding to the local sediment transport capacity) has been dumped into the river, since 1978, using two motorized barges.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe floodplains between Mainz and Bingen are important for nature conservation.  In this section, the so-called Island Rhine, there are many nature reserves and bird sanctuaries.\n\n\n== Integrated Rhine Programme (IRP) ==\nThe Upper Rhine plays a key role in flood control on the Middle and Lower Rhine.  As a result of the straightening of the Upper Rhine, floods from the Alps now reach the Middle Rhine much faster than in the past.  Thus, the risk of such a peak coinciding with a flood peak of Neckar, Moselle or Main has increased.  About 123 square kilometres (47 sq mi) of floodplain have been lost.  Authorities in riparian states of France, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate have launched the Integrated Rhine Programme, a framework for designating water retention areas. to combat downstream flooding.  A French-German treaty was concluded in 1982, in which the parties agreed to restore the retention capacity on the stretch below Iffezheim to the level it had before the area was developed.\nThis means:\nFor the stretch between Iffezheim and the mouth of the Neckar, attenuation of the apex of a 200-year flood (i.e. a flood that statistically occurs once in 200 years) of the Rhine to a discharge of 5,000 cubic metres per second (180,000 cu ft/s) at the Maxau gauge station, that is, a reduction from 5,700 cubic metres per second (200,000 cu ft/s) to 5,000 cubic metres per second (180,000 cu ft/s).\n\nfor the stretch below the mouth of the Neckar, attenuation of the apex of a 220-year flood to a discharge of 6,000 cubic metres per second (210,000 cu ft/s) at the Worms gauge station, that is, a reduction from 6,800 cubic metres per second (240,000 cu ft/s) to 6,000 cubic metres per second (210,000 cu ft/s).For this purpose the following measures are planned and partially implemented:\n\nBy France: Special operations power stations on the Rhine and construction of two polders Erstein and Moder\nBy Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: construction of about 13 polders\nBy Rhineland-Palatinate: construction of polders and relocating leveesThe effectiveness of the flood protection measures was verified using a computer model.  The State Institute for the Environment, Nature Protection and Measurements in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg carried out forecast calculations with the help of a mathematical \"synoptic flood progression model\".  The analysis of the calculations and the evaluation of the results were made on the basis of the requirements and methods set by the international Flood Study Commission for the Rhine.  The implementation of the proposed flood control measures on the Upper Rhine can prevent the occurrence of a 200-year-flood between Iffezheim and Bingen, with an overall economic loss estimated at around 6.2 billion euros.\n\n\n== Tri-national metropolitan region ==\nThe Upper Rhine tri-national region (French: R\u00e9gion M\u00e9tropolitaine Trinationale du Rhin Sup\u00e9rieur, German: Trinationale Metropolregion Oberrhein) is a Euroregion that covers the border areas of the Upper Rhine (the northern part of the Upper Rhine valley and the Palatinate are not included as they are not border areas) and parts of the High Rhine. As the name suggests, it is a tri-national region comprising parts of France, Germany and Switzerland. The regional Upper Rhine Conference is a framework for future political and administrative cooperation in the area.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUpper Rhine aquifer\n\n\n== References ==\nDieter Balle: Kultur- und Naturf\u00fchrer Oberrhein.

        "brit": "Palatinate, German Pfalz,  in German history, the lands of the count palatine, a title held by a leading secular prince of the Holy Roman Empire. Geographically, the Palatinate was divided between two small territorial clusters: the Rhenish, or Lower, Palatinate and the Upper Palatinate. The Rhenish Palatinate included lands on both sides of the middle Rhine River between its Main and Neckar tributaries. Its capital until the 18th century was Heidelberg. The Upper Palatinate was located in northern Bavaria, on both sides of the Naab River as it flows south toward the Danube, and extended eastward to the Bohemian forest. The boundaries of the Palatinate varied with the political and dynastic fortunes of the counts palatine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\nTraveler\u2019s Guide to Europe\nWhat major world city lies in both Asia and Europe?\n\n\n\nIn early medieval Germany, counts palatine served as stewards of royal territories in the absence of the Holy Roman emperors. In the 12th century the lands of the counts palatine of Lotharingia (Lorraine) were formed into the separate territory of the (Rhenish) Palatinate. In 1214 the Holy Roman emperor Frederick II granted these lands to Louis I, duke of Bavaria, of the house of Wittelsbach. This ancient Bavarian dynasty, in one or another of its branches, was to rule the Palatinate through its subsequent history. In 1329, in an internal dynastic settlement, the North Mark of Bavaria was detached from the Bavarian Wittelsbachs and given to the branch of the family that also held the Rhenish territories. The North Mark thereafter was known as the Upper Palatinate. In the 14th and 15th centuries the counts palatine brought firm rule and prosperity to their lands. They fought for the rights of the German princes against the universalist ambitions of popes and emperors. They won the right to participate in the election of the emperor, a right confirmed by the Golden Bull of 1356, which made the elector palatine the chief secular prince of the Holy Roman Empire.The Palatinate remained Roman Catholic during the early Reformation but adopted Calvinism in the 1560s under Elector Frederick III. The Palatinate became the bulwark of the Protestant cause in Germany. Elector Frederick IV became the head of the Protestant military alliance known as the Protestant Union in 1608. His son Frederick V\u2019s acceptance of the Bohemian crown in 1619 contributed to the beginning of the Thirty Years\u2019 War, a war that proved disastrous to the Palatinate. Frederick V was driven from Bohemia in 1620 and, in 1623, was deprived of his German lands and electoral dignity, which were given to Bavaria. Catholic troops devastated the Rhenish Palatinate. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) restored the Rhenish lands, as well as a new electoral dignity, to Frederick\u2019s son Charles Louis. The Upper Palatinate, however, remained with Bavaria thereafter.During the War of the Grand Alliance (1689\u201397), the troops of the French monarch Louis XIV ravaged the Rhenish Palatinate, causing many Germans to emigrate. Many of the early German settlers of America (the Pennsylvania Germans, commonly called the Pennsylvania Dutch) were refugees from the Palatinate. During the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars the Palatinate\u2019s lands on the west bank of the Rhine were incorporated into France, while its eastern lands were divided largely between neighbouring Baden and Hesse. After the defeat of Napoleon (1814\u201315), the Congress of Vienna gave the east-bank lands to Bavaria. These lands, together with some surrounding territories, again took the name of Palatinate in 1838. French troops temporarily occupied the Rhineland territories after Germany\u2019s defeat in World War I.\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\nAfter World War II, parts of the Rhenish territories were incorporated into the newly constituted federal Land (state) of Rheinland-Pfalz (Rhineland-Palatinate) in (then West) Germany.

        "wiki": "The Skulpturhalle Basel is a museum in Basel, Switzerland, featuring cast replicas of antique sculpture.  With around 2,000 casts it is the largest collection of its kind in the country, having tripled in size between 1985 and 2010.  Since 1961 the collection has been managed by the Antikenmuseum Basel.\nThe collection was started in 1830.  From 1849 it was located in the newly opened Museum an der Augustinergasse (now the location of the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Cultures).  In 1887 it moved into the Basel Kunsthalle, where a new wing known as the \"Skulpturenhalle\" had been built especially for it.  The casts had to be warehoused in 1927 when the national art collection was temporarily moved into the Kunsthalle, creating a need for more space.  In 1940 the cast collection found a provisional home in a disused factory, four years after plans for a new building had failed to pass a referendum; the new building finally materialised in 1963.\nWhen original works are split into pieces across various museums, the casts allow all the parts to be brought back together so that complete reconstructions of antique sculptures can be made.  The unique \"Parthenon Project\" assembles casts of every surviving sculptural remnant from the Parthenon Temple in Athens, and exhibits them so as to demonstrate their original arrangements.  Also in the exhibition is an array of architectural models on a scale of 1:20.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page (in German)",

        "wiki": "The Basel museums encompass a series of museums in the city of Basel, Switzerland, and the neighboring region. They represent a broad spectrum of collections with a marked concentration in the fine arts and house numerous holdings of international significance. With at least three dozen institutions, not including the local history collections in the surrounding communities, the region offers an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other metropolitan areas of similar size. They draw some one and a half million visitors annually.\nConstituting an essential and defining component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museums of the canton of Basel-City arose from the 1661 purchase of the private Amerbach Cabinet by the city and the University of Basel and thus represent the oldest civic museum collection in continuous existence. Since the 1980s, a number of collections have been made public in new purpose-built structures that have achieved renown as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.\n\n\n== Museum landscape ==\nThe main focus of collecting among Basel museums is the fine arts \u2013 painting, drawing and sculpture. More than a dozen museums cover a spectrum that extends from antiquity up to the present and includes historic and established works of art as well as pioneering creations. In particular, the latter category has been made increasingly accessible to the public over the past two decades in a series of newly opened museums. There are collections with more of a local and regional character, yet a number of area museums, especially the larger institutions, are noted for their international orientation and reach. In addition, Basel benefits from a long tradition of collecting that, in contrast to many other museums in Central Europe, was not disrupted by the wars of the 20th century, as well as from the city's well-established connections to the market of art dealers and art collectors \u2013 such as through Art Basel.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nNumerous museums address various themes of cultural history and ethnology while other institutions feature technical and scientific collections. The museums continue to be oriented to the scholarly tasks of collecting, conserving and exhibiting as well as research and education or at least view these as part of their activities. Consistent with museological trends seen elsewhere, however, the traditional self-image has evolved since the 1960s. Alongside the new forms of public outreach (museum education and didactics), institutional hybrid forms have arisen that actively embrace a sociopolitically relevant role and in which museum operations constitute just one facet, albeit a highly important one, of a more comprehensive cultural institution.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWith the city's position at the junction of the \"Dreil\u00e4ndereck\" (Three-Countries Corner) and the compact municipal boundaries within the Basel region, most of Basel's museums are located in the city of Basel and thus in the canton of Basel-City but quite a few of museums lie in the canton of Basel-Country. The Basel museum landscape can also be said to extend to the museums of the greater metropolitan area, such as those in the neighboring towns of L\u00f6rrach, Saint-Louis and Weil am Rhein, with the latter included in the annual Basel Museum Night through the participation of Vitra Design Museum in Weil. In view of the numerous municipal, regional and national administrative units that come together here as well as the broader agglomeration, it is difficult to produce a conclusive figure for the number of Basel museums. Yet even when taking a narrowly drawn perimeter, the total comes to at least three dozen institutions that house collections and make them accessible to the public. The Basel museums are also part of the German-French-Swiss \"Upper Rhine Museum Pass\" that was introduced in 1999. This covers a much wider area than the Basel region, however, extending via Strasbourg up to Mannheim.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWith the increasing aestheticization of everyday life, the architecture of museums has taken on special significance since the 1980s. A striking number of exhibition structures have incorporated a vocabulary of postmodern and deconstructivist forms. In and around Basel, new buildings, additions or renovations have been constructed from designs by nationally and internationally renowned architects (Renzo Piano, Zaha Hadid, Frank O. Gehry, Wilfried and Katharina Steib, Herzog & de Meuron, Mario Botta) and celebrated as examples of avant-garde museum architecture. In other area museums, by contrast, the building fabric is old to very old, consisting of former residential and commercial buildings or monasteries and churches that have been converted for exhibition purposes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe museums are a central aspect of Basel's touristic appeal and hence an important economic factor. A number of Basel's museums are public institutions but the majority are privately sponsored, backed in most cases by foundations. Helping to generate the high density of museums compared to other cities and metropolitan areas of similar size, these private collections have also made a substantial contribution to the high level of museum quality. The private collections nearly all came into being after the Second World War. Most of the public museums, by contrast, date from before the war. In fact, the collections of the five publicly run museums of the canton of Basel-City have histories that go back several centuries.\n\n\n== Development of the museums ==\n\n\n=== Museums in the city ===\n\n\n==== Early collections ====\n\nThe origins of the first public collection are closely linked to the University of Basel and the early modern era collections of books, art and natural curiosities, of which there were quite a few in Basel. Prominent among them, the Amerbach printer family (founded by Johann Amerbach) had collected a substantial number of books, paintings, goldsmith works, coins and natural objects during the 16th century. In 1661, the Amerbach Cabinet was on the verge of being disbanded following a purchase offer from Amsterdam, then the European center for the trade in collector's items. At the urging of the mayor Johann Rudolf Wettstein, the city and university decided to jointly purchase the collection in order to keep it in Basel. Installed in the Haus zur M\u00fccke just off Cathedral Square in 1671, the collection did not operate like a museum. It principally served as a library for university scholars, with only a few parlors on the first floor reserved for works of art and natural objects. Two librarians were in charge of administering the overall collection.\n\nBeginning in the late 18th century, Basel saw an acceleration in the growth of collections of books and objects inspired by Enlightenment-era ideals of education and refinement. Significant holdings of antiquities, coins, fossils and natural curiosities made their way into the Haus zur M\u00fccke through purchases, gifts or bequests by private collectors. An especially important addition came in 1823 with the contents of the Museum Faesch, a Basel collection from the 17th century. The first coherent ethnological collection was formed from the \"Mexican cabinet\" that had been assembled by the merchant Lukas Vischer from 1828 to 1837 during his travels in Central America. In 1821, the natural objects and artifacts were separated out from the collections in the Haus zur M\u00fccke and an independent museum of natural history was established at the Falkensteiner Hof, likewise located right off Cathedral Square, which also included the instrument cabinets of the physics and chemistry institutes.The city's official repository for art was the Basel Town Hall (Rathaus) whose rich ornamentation and upkeep represented a constant undertaking for the city and a source of commissions for numerous artists from the early 16th century onward. The city armory likely had a \"museum corner\" starting in the 16th century. Following common practice, weapons that had become unfit for war were decommissioned for disposal. In Basel, however, a substantial number of them were preserved, which means that the armory caretakers wished to store the obsolete medieval or early modern militaria for the sake of memory value. The most prominent examples were the real and supposed trophies of the Burgundian booty from 1476, which had fallen to Basel and remained on display to curious onlookers centuries later. In contrast, the care and storage of the Basel Cathedral Treasury that had lost its liturgical value in the Reformation did not bear the character of a museum. Locked away in the cathedral sacristy for three centuries, the reliquaries and other religious objects remained inaccessible and out of view until 1833 and were merely listed as book value in the state budgets.\n\n\n==== First museum building ====\n\nIn 1767, the university professor Johann Jakob d\u2019Annone had the paintings and other objects moved to the previously empty ground floor of the Haus zur M\u00fccke to create more space for the books on the first floor, and also provided for a more systematic organization. A few decades later, however, the building and its infrastructure no longer accommodated the increased volume of visitors (with the facility open four days of the week starting in 1829) and the modern culture of knowledge established through the Enlightenment. Moreover, a comprehensive index of the holdings was lacking, having been \"altogether impossible heretofore in the inadequate premises where some pieces lay buried in darkened recesses for decades beneath an inch-thick layer of dust.\"The need for space was resolved in 1849 with the removal of the collection to the multi-purpose building by Melchior Berri on Augustinergasse \u2013 simply named the \"Museum\" \u2013 on the site of the former Augustinian monastery. It was financed with a one-time contribution from the canton along with citizen donations. The late classicistic monumental edifice with decorative painting and frescoes by Arnold B\u00f6cklin is a comparatively early example of a civic museum and the first major museum in Basel. While taking clear inspiration from Karl Friedrich Schinkel and his Academy of Architecture in Berlin, the allocation of spaces and functions here combined university facilities with a library and natural history and art collections. This also served the institutional requirements of the university. Further examples of collections could be found in most of the subsidiary institutes \u2013 i.e., facilities with demonstration objects for instruction and research purposes. These included the instruments of the chemistry and physics institutes and the utensils of the anatomical institute.\n\n\n==== Division of the public collections into state museums ====\n \nParallel to the specialization of the educational and research disciplines that took hold at the beginning of the 19th century, Basel's wide-ranging holdings of objects evolved into institutional collections divided according to various scientific fields. They were very different from the cabinets of curiosities that, according to the Basel professor Wilhelm Wackernagel, had merely involved \"[mindless grabbing] at curiosities with a half-pedantic, half-childish zeal\". The Natural History Museum (Naturhistorisches Museum) founded in 1821 was the first step in this new direction. In 1836, the art collection was made legally independent from the university library with a separate publicly funded art commission to oversee it. In 1856, the \"medieval collection\" took up residence in auxiliary rooms and annexes of the Basel Cathedral (Bishop's Court, St. Nicholas Chapel), having been established earlier that year with inventories from the Museum on Augustinergasse based on the model of the German National Museum in Nuremberg. In 1887, castings of ancient sculptures were put on display in the Sculpture Hall of the Basel Art Association (Basler Kunstverein). Meanwhile, in 1874, the chemistry and physics institutes had moved into the new Bernoullianum building for the study of the natural sciences, whereupon their holdings of objects shed their collection character in favor of laboratory facilities. The canton had difficulty amassing funding and support for the creation of another museum for its collections. The Museum on Augustinergasse had represented a formidable beginning, yet remained the only one of its kind for nearly fifty years.\n\nIn 1892, the \"antiquarian collection\" (small artifacts of antiquity, excluding ethnological objects) was joined with the medieval collection of the Basel Cathedral and historical weapons from the Basel Armory to form the Historical Museum Basel (Historisches Museum Basel), with exhibition space in the reconverted Barf\u00fcsser Church from 1894 onwards. Today this museum houses the Upper Rhine's most comprehensive collection of cultural history, showing artisanal crafts (Cathedral Treasury, goldsmith works, stained glass) and objects of everyday culture (furnishings, tapestries, coin cabinet). Major emphasis is placed on the Late Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque periods. The entire inventory of books was incorporated into the collection of the new University Library in 1896. The \"ethnographic collection\", which was given the title Collection of Ethnology (Sammlung f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde) in 1905, moved into new space created by an addition to the Museum on Augustinergasse in 1917, where it became the Museum of Ethnology (Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde). With holdings of approximately 300,000 objects and a comparable number of historical photographs, it is the largest ethnological museum in Switzerland and one of the largest in Europe. The collection includes objects from Europe, Ancient Egypt, Africa, Asia (Tibet and Bali Collections), Ancient America and Oceania. In 1944, the federal administration distinguished its European holdings as the Swiss Museum of Ethnology (Schweizerisches Museum f\u00fcr Volkskunde). However, since 1997 this division no longer exists; non-European and European collections are now joined in the Basel Museum of Cultures (Museum der Kulturen Basel), whose name intentionally expresses a change in emphasis from the presentation of \u201cforeign\u201d cultures to intercultural dialogue. The Natural History Museum Basel (Naturhistorisches Museum Basel), which features most areas of the natural sciences (anthropology, mineralogy, paleontology, vertebrates, insects including the Frey Collection of Beetles and other invertebrates), has not only remained in its original location since 1849 but has also retained its traditional name. Its collections, comprising nearly eight million objects which are also dedicated to scientific research, bear the title \"Archives of Life\".\n\nThe public art collection was installed in the upper story of the Museum on Augustinergasse in 1849. Its continuing growth led to increasing spatial demands that could not be met at that location. In 1936, after a planning period of roughly three decades, the art collection moved into the Kunstmuseum Basel. Satellite locations had already been established in 1922 at the Augustinerhof on Augustinergasse (collection of prints and drawings) and at the Bachofenhaus on Cathedral Square (Bachofen Collection with additional holdings). The greater part of the art collection was temporarily housed in the Kunsthalle from 1928 until 1936. The Kunstmuseum's gallery of paintings and collection of prints and drawings comprise the largest and most significant public art collection in Switzerland. With an emphasis on paintings and drawings by artists of the Upper Rhine from 1400 to 1600 (Holbein family, Witz, Cranach the Elder, Gr\u00fcnewald) and art of the 19th to 21st centuries (B\u00f6cklin, van Gogh, C\u00e9zanne, Gauguin, Cubism with Picasso and Braque, German Expressionism, postwar American art), it also ranks as one of the leading international museums of its kind. Since the removal of the art collection to new quarters, the Museum on Augustinergasse has served as the exclusive domain of the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Cultures/Museum of Ethnology (V\u00f6lkerkundemuseum/Museum der Kulturen). A major expansion of the public museum collections occurred in 1961 with the founding of the Basel Museum of Ancient Art and Ludwig Collection (Antikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig). This new institution combined previous holdings from the Historical Museum (small artifacts of antiquity) and Kunstmuseum (sculptures) with acquisitions from private collections, which are displayed in two neoclassical villas located opposite the Kunstmuseum. The Museum of Ancient Art opened in the first villa in 1966 and expanded into the adjacent structure, also built by architect Melchior Berri, in 1988. It is the only Swiss museum devoted exclusively to the art of the Mediterranean area (mainly Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, Italic and Roman cultures, as well as Levante and the Near East) from the 4th millennium B.C. to the 7th century A.D. The collections of Greek vases, Antique sculptures and Ancient Egyptian artifacts occupy a central position within its holdings.\n\n\n==== Satellite locations of the state museums ====\n \nThe growing spatial needs of the collections that were housed in the Museum on Augustinergasse led to the incorporation of neighboring buildings. Similarly, the other museums also expanded. The Historical Museum in Barf\u00fcsser Church acquired the following satellite locations: the Museum of Domestic Life (Wohnmuseum) in the Segerhof (1926\u201334) and its successor in the Haus zum Kirschgarten since 1951, the Museum of Domestic Culture in Basel (Museum der Basler Wohnkultur); the Museum of Music (Musikmuseum), featuring five centuries of European musical history based on the musical instrument collection founded in 1943, which has been displayed since 2000 in the former prison Lohnhof; the carriage and sleigh collection in Br\u00fcglingen, established in 1981. Replica casts of ancient sculptures that were originally on display in the Sculpture Hall (Skulpturenhalle), but moved into storage in 1927 due to a lack of public interest, became part of the Museum of Ancient Art (Antikenmuseum) in 1961 and again received their own exhibition space in 1963 in the new Basel Sculpture Hall (Skulpturhalle Basel). It features the world's only complete reconstruction of architectural sculpture from the Parthenon in Athens. The Public Art Collection (\u00d6ffentliche Kunstsammlung) also expanded into a second building in 1981 with the Museum of Contemporary Art (Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwartskunst) in St. Alban-Tal. As the first public exhibition building project in Europe, it is devoted exclusively to the presentation of contemporary works and artistic production since 1960. In addition to classic media such as painting and sculpture, its acquisitions also include video art.\n\n\n==== Defunct and semi-public museums ====\n \nThe Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum) was founded in 1878 by the Society of Trades and Craftsmen as a forum for the presentation of local arts and crafts. It became a semi-public institution in 1886 before coming under full public sponsorship in 1914. Renamed the Museum of Design (Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung) in 1989 due to its broadening thematic spectrum, it was closed in 1996. Affected by the same cuts in public funding was the architecturally oriented City and Cathedral Museum (Stadt- und M\u00fcnstermuseum), established in 1939 under the auspices of the public agency for the preservation of historic monuments in the former convent of Kleines Klingental. The holdings of the Museum of Design were distributed among other institutions, with the transferral of its library and poster collection to the School of Design (Schule f\u00fcr Gestaltung). Thanks to the support of a foundation, the City and Cathedral Museum remains on the same premises under the present name Kleines Klingental Museum.\nThe Swiss Firefighting Museum (Schweizerisches Feuerwehrmuseum), founded in 1957 as the Basel Firefighting Museum, is housed on the premises of the cantonal Fire Brigade but does not have the status of a public museum and is not administered by the canton. Its collection, which includes permanent loans from the Historical Museum, features documents that date back to the 13th century. The H\u00f6rnli Cemetery Collection (Sammlung Friedhof H\u00f6rnli) operates under similar conditions: It has been located on the property of the canton's Central Cemetery since 1994 but is funded and run by a private association. On display are burial objects such as urns, documents on the history of cremation, hearses, coffins, cemetery regulations, graveyard crosses, glass pearl chains and memorial keepsakes.\n\n\n==== Additional museums ====\n\nThe first museum that was not supported and administered by the canton of Basel-City was established in 1860 in a large room at the Basel Mission. It presented ritual and cultural objects from the countries and ethnic groups among which the Basel Mission was active, as well as a portrait gallery of its missionaries. However, parts of this exhibit were later sold to the canton and the gallery space was closed. The concept of a multi-purpose building, following the example of the Museum on Augustinergasse, was embraced by the Basel Art Society (Basler Kunstverein), which erected the Kunsthalle on Steinenberg between 1869 and 1872. In addition to exhibition space and administrative offices, this building housed a library and studio space for sculptors. A building wing added in 1885 accommodated the Sculpture Hall (Skulpturhalle), where the previously mentioned casts of Antique statues from the Museum on Augustinergasse were displayed from 1886 to 1927. The former Artists House (K\u00fcnstlerhaus) now defines itself \u201cas a hub between artists and art agents and as a place that brings together local and international developments.\u201d The next privately initiated museum was the above-mentioned Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum); founded in 1878, it came under cantonal administration just eight years later. The Anatomical Museum (Anatomisches Museum) of the University of Basel dates back to the acquisitional activities of Carl Gustav Jung in the 1820s. As the Collection of Pathology and Anatomy (Pathologisch-Anatomische Sammlung), it moved into its own building in 1880. Two especially significant objects in this collection are the oldest anatomical specimen in the world (prepared by Andreas Vesalius in Basel in 1543) and a skeleton prepared by Felix Platter in 1573.The Museum of Pharmacy (Pharmazie-Historisches Museum, originally the Historical Apothecary Collection) followed in 1924 after the donation of a private collection to the University of Basel. It is one of the world's largest collections on the history of pharmacy, encompassing old pharmaceuticals and early apothecary objects, laboratory utensils, ceramics, instruments, books, arts and crafts. The Swiss Gymnastics and Sports Museum (Schweizerische Turn- und Sportmuseum), established in 1945, was renamed as the Swiss Sport Museum in 1977. Sponsored by a foundation (Stiftung Sportmuseum Schweiz), its major focus is on ball sports, cycling, gymnastics and winter sports. The shipping museum Transport Hub Switzerland (Verkehrsdrehscheibe Schweiz) emerged from a 1954 exhibition by the Swiss Shipping Company (Schweizerische Reederei) in the Rhine ports of Basel, entitled \u201cOur Path to the Sea.\u201d It is also supported and run by an association of private citizens. The Swiss Historical Paper Collection (Schweizerische Papierhistorische Sammlung) was an affiliate of the Museum of Ethnology (Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde) from 1954 to 1979 before moving into independent quarters in the Gallician Mill, located in the former industrial district of St. Alban, in 1980. Now known as the Swiss Museum for Paper, Writing and Printing (Schweizerisches Museum f\u00fcr Papier, Schrift und Druck), it is sponsored by the Basel Paper Mill Foundation (Stiftung Basler Papierm\u00fchle). The Jewish Museum of Switzerland (J\u00fcdisches Museum Schweiz), which presents the cultural history of Jews in Switzerland and in Basel including documents from the First Zionist Congress held in Basel in 1897, was founded by the Society for the Jewish Museum of Switzerland in 1966.\n\nLike the Kleines Klingental Museum, the Klingental Exhibition Gallery (Ausstellungsraum Klingental) is located in the building complex of the former Klingental convent. Opened in 1974, the gallery serves as a presentation platform for the current work of artists living in Basel and aims to support emerging artistic talents. It is sponsored by the Klingental Gallery Society (Verein Ausstellungsraum Klingental). The Caricature and Cartoon Museum Basel (Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel), by contrast, was initiated by an individual, the collector and patron Dieter Burckhardt. Founded in 1979, it is devoted to caricatures, cartoons, comics, parodies and pastiches. The eponymous foundation (Stiftung Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel) is a dependent affiliate of the Christoph Merian Foundation. The exhibition galleries have been located in a structure from the Late Gothic period since 1996, following the completion of renovations and a new building addition by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. The Swiss Architecture Museum (Schweizerisches Architekturmuseum), founded in 1984, has resided since 2004 in the building complex of the Kunsthalle, which was completely renovated and redesigned by the architectural offices Miller & Maranta and Peter M\u00e4rkli. The museum, sponsored by the Architecture Museum Foundation, presents alternating exhibitions on topics of international architecture and urbanism. An advantageous factor is the unusual concentration of internationally renowned architectural firms in Basel; Herzog & de Meuron, in particular, have made significant contributions to regional museum architecture.\nOpened in 1996, the Tinguely Museum features a permanent exhibition on the life and work of the artist Jean Tinguely. The museum's temporary exhibitions present works by friends and contemporaries of Tinguely, as well as other modern artists. Designed by Mario Botta, the museum is financed entirely by the Basel pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche. The Dollhouse Museum (Puppenhausmuseum) was founded in 1998 by its patron and owner Gigi Oeri, who built up the collection herself. In addition to dolls, dollhouses and miniature shops from the 19th and 20th century, it displays the world's largest collection of teddy bears. The media art space [plug.in] opened its doors in 2000 with the backing of the Forum for New Media Association (Verein Forum f\u00fcr neue Medien), which had been founded the previous year. It realizes exhibitions and projects, provides artists with international networking opportunities and helps convey works of media art to the general public. With one of the world's most extensive collections of photographs (around 300,000 works with an emphasis on industrial society in the 19th century), the Herzog Foundation has exhibited its holdings since 2002 in a \u201cLaboratory for Photography\u201d. Located in the Dreispitz industrial sector, the warehouse converted by Herzog & de Meuron encompasses the collection along with a reference library on the history of photography and two additional rooms for study, teaching and research purposes.\n\n\n=== Museums in surrounding communities ===\nMany of the small and mid-sized municipalities around Basel have museums of local history and culture that are not presented in the following. Mention is given to institutions whose scope extends beyond the local level and which are generally open to the public several days a week.\n\n\n==== Collections of natural, cultural and technological history ====\nThe oldest museum in the Basel region outside the city is the Museum of Canton Basel-Country (Museum des Kantons Basel-Landschaft) in Liestal, nowadays called Museum.BL. It was founded in 1837 as a \"Cabinet of Natural Curiosities\" (Naturaliencabinett) and up through the 1930s primarily took up objects of natural history into the collections. Since then, the emphasis has shifted toward cultural history. The diversity of the collection allows the museum to address wide-ranging themes related to the environment, history and the present day. The Museum am Burghof in L\u00f6rrach traces its origins to the L\u00f6rrach Antiquities Association (L\u00f6rracher Altertumsverein) founded in 1882, which bequeathed its collection to the town of L\u00f6rrach in 1927. Commencing operations in 1932 as the Museum of Local History (Heimatmuseum), the current permanent exhibition \u201cExpoTriRhena\u201d presents the history, present-day culture and divisions and similarities within the \"Dreil\u00e4ndereck\" (Three-Countries Corner) border region where Germany, France and Switzerland meet.\n\nOpened in 1957, the Roman Museum at Augst (R\u00f6mermuseum Augst) is an open-air museum on the grounds of the former Roman city of Augusta Raurica, which has been the subject of excavations going back to the Renaissance. The exhibits feature numerous archaeological finds, including the largest silver treasure from Late Antiquity. The adjacent reconstruction of a Roman House (R\u00f6merhaus) was a gift of the Basel patron Ren\u00e9 Clavel while the museum and the entire archaeological park constitute a departmental division of Basel-Country. Located in the Br\u00fcglinger Plateau, the Mill Museum (M\u00fchlemuseum) of the Christoph Merian Foundation is housed in the water mill of the former Br\u00fcglingen farming estate. The structure was converted into a museum in 1966 and presents the history of the mill and the work of millers from the Bronze Age up to the 20th century. The mill is still functional, allowing periodic demonstrations of the operational sequence from the water-powered mill wheel to the rotating millstone.\nOpened to the public in 1972, the Toy Museum and Village and Wine Cultivation Museum (Spielzeugmuseum, Dorf- und Rebbaumuseum) in Riehen complements its exhibits of village history and wine growing with one of the most significant collections of European toys. The toys are drawn from private collections as well as loans from the Museum of Cultures (Museum der Kulturen). The museum is operated as a division of the municipal administration of Riehen. The Museum of Music Automatons (Museum f\u00fcr Musikautomaten) in Seewen, located on the outermost periphery of the Basel museum territory, houses one of the world's largest and most well known collections of Swiss music boxes, disc music boxes, musical timepieces and jewelry and other mechanical musical automatons. It opened to the public in 1979 as a private museum of the collector Heinrich Weiss and was gifted to the Swiss Confederation in 1990. A newly remodeled and expanded facility for presentation of the exhibits was completed in 2000. Finally, the Museum of Electricity (Elektrizit\u00e4tsmuseum) of the electric utility Elektra Birseck opened its doors in M\u00fcnchenstein in 1997. Exhibits explore the history and development of power production and its use. The collection contains rare historic equipment and is complemented by a laboratory in which visitors can experiment with electric power.\n\n\n==== Emphasis on art collections ====\n\nSince the late 1980s, the Basel region has seen a proliferation of new museums addressing themes of art and design, especially concerning works from more recent years. The Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein presents a broad range of design topics, with a special emphasis on furniture and interior design. Though originally based on the private collection of chairs and other furniture assembled by Rolf Fehlbaum, the owner of the Vitra furniture company, the museum was established as an independent institution. The Vitra building complex has made notable contributions to the body of avant-garde architecture in the Basel region. In addition to the 1989 museum by Frank O. Gehry, the grounds feature structures by Zaha Hadid, Nicholas Grimshaw, Tadao Ando and \u00c1lvaro Siza. In 1982, the Beyeler Foundation assumed ownership of the art collection of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler, which the couple had built up over half a century. Since 1997, the works of classical modern art have been exhibited in a building designed by Renzo Piano in the town of Riehen. Featured artists include Degas, Monet, C\u00e9zanne, van Gogh, Picasso, Rothko, Warhol, Lichtenstein and Bacon. The trees in the park surrounding the highly acclaimed building were wrapped by Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1998.\n\nWith the creation of the Basel-Country Art Museum (Kunsthaus Baselland) in Muttenz, the Basel-Country Art Association (Kunstverein Baselland) was given its own dedicated exhibition building in 1997. The Art Museum is devoted to contemporary art and presents temporary exhibitions of current projects by regional and international artists. Opened in 1998, Riehen Art Space (Kunst Raum Riehen) is another public institution with a similar thematic orientation. It serves the municipality of Riehen and its art commission with exhibitions of contemporary works of art from the region. Established in 2001, the Sculpture at Schoenthal Foundation in the former Sch\u00f6nthal monastery presents over twenty works by international and Swiss artists in a permanently accessible sculpture park under the motto \u201cArt and Nature in Dialogue\u201d. A Romanesque-era church has been converted into a gallery for temporary exhibitions of contemporary artists. In 2003, the Schaulager (or \u201cviewing warehouse\u201d) of the Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation was opened in M\u00fcnchenstein. Centered on the avant-garde art collection of the foundation, the institute functions as a mix between public museum, art storage facility and art research institute. The polygonal building is a design by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. The Fernet Branca Contemporary Art Space (Espace d\u2019Art Contemporain Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, the Alsatian town just across the border from Basel, is located in the former Fernet-Branca spirits distillery that was decommissioned in 2000. Since 2004, the museum has presented temporary exhibitions on contemporary art themes and artists. The museum's operations are supported by the Association for the Fernet Branca Contemporary Art Museum (Association pour le Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Contemporain Fernet Branca).\n\n\n== Museum promotion and museum policy ==\n\n\n=== Primacy of the library ===\n\nMany museums can be traced back to courtly collections \u2013 at least in terms of the original set of holdings. Since the 19th century, in contrast, Basel has embraced a culture of remembrance of having created the oldest existing civic museum collection through its purchase of the Amerbach Cabinet in the year 1661. The acquisition of a collection from the 16th century fits with the historical and documentary interest in art that was prevalent at the time. In fact, however, the purchase was chiefly prompted by a desire to enhance the university's inventory of books with the extensive book holdings of the Amerbach Cabinet. The Haus zur M\u00fccke community hall that housed the university-administered collection was called the \u201cLibrary\u201d in recognition of its primary function. The role as the city's art repository did not shift from the Basel Town Hall (Rathaus) to the Haus zur M\u00fccke until the latter half of the 18th century. The Passion Altarpiece by Holbein that had been one of the main visitor attractions since the Reformation was moved over in 1770, followed by several additional paintings from the town council's inventories in 1771 and Holbein's organ doors from the Cathedral in 1786. Despite this weighting of the collections, the official legal status remained unchanged for quite some time. The natural history holdings and art collection were not split off from the library until 1821 and 1836, respectively.\nAt the end of the 18th century, civic museum culture was still in the early stages of its development, as illustrated by the very limited opening hours of the Haus zur M\u00fccke (Thursday afternoon from two to four in the afternoon, otherwise on request). The first records of regular gallery visits by city residents and outside visitors date to this period. In the three centuries before and after 1800, most of the collection activities involved objects of natural history, with a substantial number of acquisitions and gifts in this area. The numerous top-level art objects that made their way to Basel in the 1790s from Revolutionary France, on the other hand, did not find a wide audience of buyers and in most cases were resold.\n\n\n=== Transfer to the state and popular education ===\nFor the republican and monarchical civic states of the 19th century, collections in the form of public museums became emblems of self-determination. The carting off of large numbers of artworks to Paris during the Napoleonic Wars had created an awareness of the identity-shaping power of art. Institutional role models were the \u201cMus\u00e9e fran\u00e7ais\u201d in the Louvre and the \u201cMus\u00e9e des monuments fran\u00e7ais\u201d in a former Augustinian convent, which closed in 1816. The maintenance of programmatic museum collections and the construction of museum buildings became one of the most prominent and defining national functions.In the case of Basel, however, it was the increasing need for space in the Haus zur M\u00fccke that prompted deliberations regarding construction of a new building. The discussion concerning the right location for the public collection took on a political dimension following the division of the canton into city and regional sections. The University Act (Universit\u00e4tsgesetz) of 1818 had made the corporatively autonomous university a cantonal educational establishment, with the university holdings thus owned indirectly by the state. According to the arbitral decision governing the cantonal split, two-thirds of the university's collection belonged to the regional canton and had to be purchased by the city canton. The ensuing consternation in the city led to the Administration and Use of University Holdings Act (Gesetz \u00fcber Verwaltung und Verwendung des Universit\u00e4tsgutes) of 1836 that such goods were indissolubly tied to the locality of the city of Basel for the purposes of education. This provision has remained in effect to the present day.\n\nThese occurrences led to the founding of the Voluntary Academic Society of Basel (Freiwillige Akademische Gesellschaft) in 1835, which began supporting the collections in financial terms and through purchases and gifts as part of its general promotion of the university. Yet the greatest momentum for the museum building came from natural science circles centered on the physics and chemistry professor Peter Merian, who was likely responsible for securing a dedicated annual budget for the Natural History Museum \u2013 the only state collection with this distinction. A combination of academic institution, library and laboratories, the establishment of the Natural History Museum at the Falkensteiner Hof also provided a model for the museum building. The fact that a primary museum building was ultimately created instead of a university-affiliated building was due to the university's poor standing among wide sections of the merchant and industrialist classes. In these sectors, the university was considered a backward-looking institution. The museum, by contrast, was seen as a driving force for practical popular education and the community was willing to support its construction with private contributions as part of a wider process of renewal in the city.\n\nAt the instigation of Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein, the Voluntary Museum Association of Basel (Freiwilliger Museumsverein) was initiated in 1850 as the successor to an earlier association founded in 1841 for the construction of the museum. Modelled after the Royal Institution in London, it was established to \u201cstimulate the appreciation of science and art\u201d. Open to all residents of Basel, the association promoted the collections with financial means and sought to generate interest in the museum through public lectures to which women were also admitted. It was unable to sustain the initial enthusiasm, however, and experienced losses in membership despite Basel's rapid population growth in the latter half of the century. The museum did not embrace the function of popular education that had been promoted by its founders and supporters. The ideational socialization role of the museum was very slow to proceed, with the museum long holding onto former organizational structures. The art collection furthermore did not get an academically trained conservator until 1887. In addition, the renewed University Act of 1866 discontinued regular state appropriations for the antiquarian, medieval and art collections and left them dependent on proceeds from entry fees and the support of associations and private individuals, the most significant of these being the Birrmann Foundation and the Emilie Linder Foundation on behalf of the art collection. It was this support that enabled an active collection policy that went beyond the receipt of inherited cultural assets.\n\n\n=== Civic culture of remembrance and modernism ===\n\nFrom the outset, the museum authorities charged the collections with a federal mission, wanting them to exert a \u201cbeneficial and salutary influence on the entire Fatherland\u201d. The \u201cunofficial national gallery\u201d grew over time, primarily through acquisitions of Swiss works of art. When negotiations got underway in 1883 regarding the establishment of a federal museum, the canton of Basel-City sought to be chosen as the location for the new institution and proposed its collections of cultural history as the nucleus of the museum, systematically expanding them in light of its candidacy. While the Swiss National Museum (Schweizerisches Landesmuseum) ended up in Zurich, plans were nevertheless realized for a history museum that was no longer generally Swiss but specifically related to Basel, located in the historic former Barf\u00fcsser Church from the High Gothic period. The establishment of the Historical Museum \u201cwas a self-assured display of Basel\u2019s art-mindedness and craftsmanship, a mix of educational corridor and enfilade of stalls\u201d. The transfer of the Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum) to the state a few years earlier as an arena of contemporary achievements can likewise be seen under the aspect of civic pride and reinvented sense of commonality in which the citizenry understood its ideals and capabilities as a foundation of state and society.\n\nWhile the collections had clearly established their international standing, this appreciation did not become rooted in the cultural awareness of a broader range of social classes until the end of the 19th century. The historic culture of remembrance that was growing in importance and impact at the time was strongly linked with the medieval collection and the many Late Medieval and Renaissance works of the Upper Rhine in the Kunstmuseum. In the years since, Basel has also cultivated its claim of possessing the oldest municipal art collection in continuous existence through its acquisition of the Amerbach Cabinet. On the occasion of two major public celebrations in 1892 (500th anniversary of Greater Basel's acquisition of Lesser Basel) and 1901 (Basel's 400th anniversary as part of the Swiss Confederation), Basel presented the civically minded portion of the population (and hence the base of support for the museums) with a series of identity-shaping historical and patriotic gestures that borrowed from the store of images from the past available in the museums.\n[[File:Franz Marc-The Fate of the Animals-1913.jpg|thumb|Franz Marc: Animal Destinies, 1913. The painting was offered by the German Reich in 1939 as \u201cdegenerate art\u201d and purchased by the city of Basel.]]\nWith the epochal break of the First World War and in light of societal and cultural developments, the Basel museums became concerned with the citizenry's assertions of legitimacy and quest for recognition and their representation within these very same institutions. The discussions regarding the relationship of the museums to modernism took on particular relevance in the area of the fine arts. The construction of a dedicated museum for Basel's art collection ignited a \u201cmonumentality debate\u201d in the late 1920s, in which the proponents of functionally oriented New Building (Neues Bauen) rejected the timelessly classic palatial form that was ultimately chosen as a demonstration of power by a conservative and \u201cintellectually spent\u201d notion of culture. In contrast to the form of architectural expression and the general anti-modernistic spirit of the 1930s, the acquisitions from the 1920s up to the outbreak of the Second World War took a decisively modern tack. In 1934, the public art collection added its first painting by Vincent van Gogh along with an ensemble of 134 drawings by Paul C\u00e9zanne. Founded in 1933, the Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation supported the Kunstmuseum in these efforts and took up residence in the facility with its works of contemporary art in 1940. The breakthrough in altering the overall profile came with the special funding credit provided by the Basel-City parliament in 1939 at the instigation of museum director Georg Schmidt for the purchase of German museum holdings that the National Socialists had vilified as \u201cdegenerate art\u201d.\n\nThe establishment of classical modernism at the Kunstmuseum continued with ongoing acquisitions of postwar-era art, in particular with works by American artists. In Basel's claim to being a \u201cMuseum City\u201d, the highly controversial and unsuccessful referendum against the purchase of two Picasso paintings in 1967 holds considerable importance and constitutes a key moment in Basel's culture of remembrance in regard to the fusing of society and museum.\n\n\n=== Democratization, popularization ===\nDespite the affirmation by voters, traditional museums found themselves in a prolonged crisis beginning in the late 1960s. Not limited to Basel, this crisis originated in the profound sociopolitical reevaluation of culture of the era. The acquisitions of the State Art Credit and the 1967 Christmas exhibition at Kunsthalle Basel set off fierce protests among the loosely organized association of rejected artists, which became known as the Farnsburg Group (Farnsburgergruppe). Even the cantonal parliament got involved in addressing the concerns. The events raised the question of whether Basel was \u201cjust a museum city\u201d \u2013 here meant in a derogatory sense \u2013 and prompted a broadly cast debate over the fostering of young artists and the functioning of the museums. The establishment of the Klingental Exhibition Gallery (Ausstellungsraum Klingental) several years later was a direct consequence of the shortcomings that had been identified.\n\nThe democratization that took hold in the 1960s meant doing away with the elite in favor of the egalitarian, dispelling fears of the new and unknown. With a focus on the constructivist  works of the 1960s associated with the \u201cNew Tendencies\u201d (Nouvelles Tendances) movement, the short-lived Progressive Museum (1968\u20131974) set out to \u201cestablish a modern collection that would be accessible to the public from the very beginning\u201d and wanted to avoid any sort of \u201csecularized ceremony\u201d. The expansion of education and communication, likewise a mandate stemming from this era, could only be achieved through an increase in funding. Since the mid-1970s, however, increasingly tight budgets and persistent financial difficulties in the public sector have exerted a palpable impact on museums. The museum studies program at the University of Basel could only be offered from 1992 to 1994 due to funding shortages. In the mid-1990s, a government resolution cut the budget of the state museums by ten percent, leading to the 1996 closure of two museums, the Museum of Design (Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung) and the City and Cathedral Museum (Stadt- und M\u00fcnstermuseum). The ensuing debate and the pressure from a public referendum in support of the city's museums led to the adoption of the Basel-City Museums Act (Museumsgesetz) of 1999, which placed the holdings of the remaining five state museums (Museum of Ancient Art, Historical Museum, Kunstmuseum, Museum of Cultures, Natural History Museum) in the hands of the parliament. As a central component of cultural expenditures, the museums have also been included in the intensified negotiations over the past several years between the two Basel cantons regarding payment for the city-provided services within the framework of a fiscal equalization scheme.\n\nSince the 1980s, the museums have experienced simultaneous trends toward popularization and aestheticization. The ensuing decades have been marked by a wave of new museum buildings whose avant-garde architecture has achieved international prominence. Contributing considerably to popularization was the exhibition concept of the Mus\u00e9e Sentimental, which focuses on the world of un-prosaic everyday culture and experience and led to a 1989 exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Design (Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung). The annual Basel Museum Night tallies around a hundred thousand museum visits while the museums attract a total of approximately 1.4 million visitors throughout the year (as of 2006). The general population credits the museums with \u201ca leading role in providing leisure-time opportunities for education and learning\u201d. Museums operate in an environment that is increasingly subject to the conditions of both the leisure market and the free market, and are recognized as an important economic and locational factor. In contrast to the state, the use of private funds in the museum field has grown considerably. Funding from patrons or sponsors plays an increasingly significant role in the financing of exhibitions, parts of collections or entire museums and is thus highly sought after. This competitive situation is further reflected in the considerable institutional autonomy of the Basel-City museums, which are the only governmental enterprises in the canton operating under the private-sector influenced method of New Public Management.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nBirkner, Othmar; Rebsamen, Hanspeter (1986).

        "wiki": "Basel II is the second of the Basel Accords, (now extended and partially superseded by Basel III), which are recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\nThe Basel II Accord was published initially in June 2004 and was intended to amend international banking standards that controlled how much capital banks were required to hold to guard against the financial and operational risks banks face.  These regulations aimed to ensure that the more significant the risk a bank is exposed to, the greater the amount of capital the bank needs to hold to safeguard its solvency and overall economic stability.  Basel II attempted to accomplish this by establishing risk and capital management requirements to ensure that a bank has adequate capital for the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending, investment and trading activities. One focus was to maintain sufficient consistency of regulations so to limit competitive inequality amongst internationally active banks.\nBasel II was implemented in the years prior to 2008, and was only to be implemented in early 2008 in most major economies; the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 intervened before Basel II could become fully effective. As Basel III was negotiated, the crisis was top of mind and accordingly more stringent standards were contemplated and quickly adopted in some key countries including in Europe and the US.\n\n\n== Objective ==\nThe final version aims at:\n\nEnsuring that capital allocation is more risk-sensitive;\nEnhancing disclosure requirements which would allow market participants to assess the capital adequacy of an institution;\nEnsuring that credit risk, operational risk and market risk are quantified based on data and formal techniques;\nAttempting to align economic and regulatory capital more closely to reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage.While the final accord has at large addressed the regulatory arbitrage issue, there are still areas where regulatory capital requirements will diverge from the economic capital.\n\n\n== The accord in operation: Three pillars ==\nBasel II uses a \"three pillars\" concept \u2013 (1) minimum capital requirements (addressing risk), (2) supervisory review and (3) market discipline.\nThe Basel I accord dealt with only parts of each of these pillars. For example: concerning the first Basel II pillar, only one risk, credit risk, was dealt with easily while the market risk was an afterthought; operational risk was not dealt with at all.\n\n\n=== The first pillar: Minimum capital requirements ===\nThe first pillar deals with maintenance of regulatory capital calculated for three major components of risk that a bank faces: credit risk, operational risk, and market risk. Other risks are not considered fully quantifiable at this stage.\n\nThe credit risk component can be calculated in three different ways of varying degree of sophistication, namely standardized approach, Foundation IRB, Advanced IRB. IRB stands for \"Internal Rating-Based Approach\".\nFor operational risk, there are three different approaches \u2013 basic indicator approach or BIA, standardized approach or TSA, and the internal measurement approach (an advanced form of which is the advanced measurement approach or AMA).\nFor market risk the preferred approach is VaR (value at risk).As the Basel II recommendations are phased in by the banking industry it will move from standardised requirements to more refined and specific requirements that have been developed for each risk category by each bank. The upside for banks that do develop their bespoke risk measurement systems is that they will be rewarded with potentially lower risk capital requirements. In the future, there will be closer links between the concepts of economic and regulatory capital.\n\n\n=== The second pillar: Supervisory review ===\nThis is a regulatory response to the first pillar, giving regulators better 'tools' over those previously available. It also provides a framework for dealing with systemic risk, pension risk, concentration risk, strategic risk, reputational risk, liquidity risk and legal risk, which the accord combines under the title of residual risk. Banks can review their risk management system.\nThe Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) is a result of Pillar 2 of Basel II accords.\n\n\n=== The third pillar: Market discipline ===\nThis pillar aims to complement the minimum capital requirements and supervisory review process by developing a set of disclosure requirements which will allow the market participants to gauge the capital adequacy of an institution.\nMarket discipline supplements regulation as sharing of information facilitates the assessment of the bank by others, including investors, analysts, customers, other banks, and rating agencies, which leads to good corporate governance. The aim of Pillar 3 is to allow market discipline to operate by requiring institutions to disclose details on the scope of application, capital, risk exposures, risk assessment processes, and the capital adequacy of the institution. It must be consistent with how the senior management, including the board, assess and manage the risks of the institution.\nWhen market participants have a sufficient understanding of a bank's activities and the controls it has in place to manage its exposures, they are better able to distinguish between banking organizations so that they can reward those that manage their risks prudently and penalize those that do not.\nThese disclosures are required to be made at least twice a year, except qualitative disclosures providing a summary of the general risk management objectives and policies which can be made annually. Institutions are also required to create a formal policy on what will be disclosed and controls around them along with the validation and frequency of these disclosures. In general, the disclosures under Pillar 3 apply to the top consolidated level of the banking group to which the Basel II framework applies.\n\n\n== Recent chronological updates ==\n\n\n=== September 2005 update ===\nOn September 30, 2005, the four US Federal banking agencies (the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision) announced their revised plans for the U.S. implementation of the Basel II accord. This delays implementation of the accord for US banks by 12 months.\n\n\n=== November 2005 update ===\nOn November 15, 2005, the committee released a revised version of the Accord, incorporating changes to the calculations for market risk and the treatment of double default effects. These changes had been flagged well in advance, as part of a paper released in July 2005.\n\n\n=== July 2006 update ===\nOn July 4, 2006, the committee released a comprehensive version of the Accord, incorporating the June 2004 Basel II Framework, the elements of the 1988 Accord  that were not revised during the Basel II process, the 1996 Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks, and the November 2005 paper on Basel II: International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework. No new elements have been introduced in this compilation. This version is now the current version.\n\n\n=== November 2007 update ===\nOn November 1, 2007, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (U.S. Department of the Treasury) approved a final rule implementing the advanced approaches of the Basel II Capital Accord. This rule establishes regulatory and supervisory expectations for credit risk, through the Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRB), and operational risk, through the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA), and articulates enhanced standards for the supervisory review of capital adequacy and public disclosures for the largest U.S. banks.\n\n\n=== July 16, 2008 update ===\nOn July 16, 2008 the federal banking and thrift agencies (the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision) issued a final guidance outlining the supervisory review process for the banking institutions that are implementing the new advanced capital adequacy framework (known as Basel II).  The final guidance, relating to the supervisory review, is aimed at helping banking institutions meet certain qualification requirements in the advanced approaches rule, which took effect on April 1, 2008.\n\n\n=== January 16, 2009 update ===\nFor public consultation, a series of proposals to enhance the Basel II framework was announced by the  Basel Committee. It releases a consultative package that includes: the revisions to the Basel II market risk framework; the guidelines for computing capital for incremental risk in the trading book; and the proposed enhancements to the Basel II framework.\n\n\n=== July 8\u20139, 2009 update ===\nA final package of measures to enhance the three pillars of the Basel II framework and to strengthen the 1996 rules governing trading book capital was issued by the newly expanded Basel Committee. These measures include the enhancements to the Basel II framework, the revisions to the Basel II market-risk framework and the guidelines for computing capital for incremental risk in the trading book.\n\n\n== Basel II and the regulators ==\nOne of the most difficult aspects of implementing an international agreement is the need to accommodate differing cultures, varying structural models, complexities of public policy, and existing regulation. Banks' senior management will determine corporate strategy, as well as the country in which to base a particular type of business, based in part on how Basel II is ultimately interpreted by various countries' legislatures and regulators.To assist banks operating with multiple reporting requirements for different regulators according to geographic location, there are several software applications available.  These include capital calculation engines and extend to automated reporting solutions which include the reports required under COREP/FINREP.\nFor example, U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Sheila Bair explained in June 2007 the purpose of capital adequacy requirements for banks, such as the accord:\n\nThere are strong reasons for believing that banks left to their own devices would maintain less capital\u2014not more\u2014than would be prudent. The fact is, banks do benefit from implicit and explicit government safety nets. Investing in a bank is perceived as a safe bet. Without proper capital regulation, banks can operate in the marketplace with little or no capital. And governments and deposit insurers end up holding the bag, bearing much of the risk and cost of failure. History shows this problem is very real \u2026 as we saw with the U.S. banking and S & L crisis in the late 1980s and 1990s. The final bill for inadequate capital regulation can be very heavy. In short, regulators can't leave capital decisions totally to the banks. We wouldn't be doing our jobs or serving the public interest if we did.\n\n\n=== Implementation progress ===\nRegulators in most jurisdictions around the world plan to implement the new accord, but with widely varying timelines and use of the varying methodologies being restricted. The United States' various regulators have agreed on a final approach. They have required the Internal Ratings-Based approach for the largest banks, and the standardized approach will be available for smaller banks.In India, Reserve Bank of India has implemented the Basel II standardized norms on 31 March 2009 and is moving to internal ratings in credit and AMA (Advanced Measurement Approach) norms for operational risks in banks.\nExisting RBI norms for banks in India (as of September 2010): Common equity (incl of buffer): 3.6% (Buffer Basel 2 requirement requirements are zero); Tier 1 requirement: 6%. Total Capital: 9% of risk-weighted assets.\nAccording to the draft guidelines published by RBI the capital ratios are set to become: Common Equity as 5% + 2.5% (Capital Conservation Buffer) + 0\u20132.5% (Counter Cyclical Buffer), 7% of Tier 1 capital and minimum capital adequacy ratio (excluding Capital Conservation Buffer) of 9% of Risk Weighted Assets. Thus the actual capital requirement is between 11 and 13.5% (including Capital Conservation Buffer and Counter Cyclical Buffer).In response to a questionnaire released by the Financial Stability Institute (FSI), 95 national regulators indicated they were to implement Basel II, in some form or another, by 2015.The European Union has already implemented the Accord via the EU Capital Requirements Directives and many European banks already report their capital adequacy ratios according to the new system. All the credit institutions adopted it by 2008\u201309.\nAustralia, through its Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, implemented the Basel II Framework on 1 January 2008.\n\n\n== Basel II and the global financial crisis ==\nThe role of Basel II, both before and after the global financial crisis, has been discussed widely. While some argue that the crisis demonstrated weaknesses in the framework, others have criticized it for actually increasing the effect of the crisis. In response to the financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published revised global standards, popularly known as Basel III. The Committee claimed that the new standards would lead to a better quality of capital, increased coverage of risk for capital market activities and better liquidity standards among other benefits.\nNout Wellink, former Chairman of the BCBS, wrote an article in September 2009 outlining some of the strategic responses which the Committee should take as response to the crisis. He proposed a stronger regulatory framework which comprises five key components: (a) better quality of regulatory capital, (b) better liquidity management and supervision, (c) better risk management and supervision including enhanced Pillar 2 guidelines, (d)\nenhanced Pillar 3 disclosures related to securitization, off-balance sheet exposures and trading activities which would promote transparency, and (e) cross-border supervisory cooperation. Given one of the major factors which drove the crisis was the evaporation of liquidity in the financial markets, the BCBS also published principles for better liquidity management and supervision in September 2008.A recent OECD study suggest that bank regulation based on the Basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced  adverse systemic shocks that materialised during the financial crisis. According to the study, capital regulation based on risk-weighted assets encourages innovation designed to circumvent regulatory requirements and shifts banks' focus away from their core economic functions. Tighter capital requirements based on risk-weighted assets, introduced in the Basel III, may further contribute to these skewed incentives. New liquidity regulation, notwithstanding its good intentions, is another likely candidate to increase bank incentives to exploit regulation.\nThink-tanks such as the World Pensions Council (WPC) have also argued that European legislators have pushed dogmatically and naively for the adoption of the Basel II recommendations, adopted in 2005, transposed in European Union law through the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), effective since 2008. In essence, they forced private banks, central banks, and bank regulators to rely more on assessments of credit risk by private rating agencies. Thus, part of the regulatory authority was abdicated in favour of private rating agencies.Long before the implementation of Basel II George W. Stroke and Martin H. Wiggers pointed out, that a global financial and economic crisis will come, because of its systemic dependencies on a few rating agencies. After the breakout of the crisis Alan Greenspan agreed to this opinion in 2007. At least the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report confirmed this point of view in 2011.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBasel IA\nBasel III\nCapital adequacy\nCredit risk\nMarket risk\nOperational risk\nSolvency II\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBank for International Settlements (BIS)Basel II: Revised international capital framework\nBasel II: International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: a Revised Framework (BCBS)\nBasel II: International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: a Revised Framework (BCBS) (November 2005 Revision)\nBasel II: International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: a Revised Framework, Comprehensive Version (BCBS) (June 2006 Revision)Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (United States)Agencies Issue Final Guidance on Supervisory Review Process (Pillar 2) Related to Implementation of Basel II Advanced Approaches\nOCC Approves Basel II Capital RuleUK governmentCapital Requirements Directive/Basel 2 (FSA)\nEU Directive implementing the new Basel 2 Accord Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)Validating Risk Rating Systems under the IRB Approaches, HKMA\nReturn of capital adequacy ratio (final version) \u2013 Completion instructions, HKMA\nReturn Templates of capital Adequacy Ratio, HKMAOthersAn academic response to Basel II\nCoherent measures of risk (a widely quoted paper)\nFRB Boston paper on measurement of operational risk\nDan\u00edelsson, J\u00f3n. \"The Emperor Has No Clothes:  Limits to Risk Modelling.\" Journal of Banking and Finance, 2002, 26, pp. 1273\u201396.\nCanada Capital Adequacy Requirements OSFI\nA Nontechnical Analysis of Basel I and II",

        "wiki": "Basel SBB railway station (German: Bahnhof Basel SBB, or in earlier times Centralbahnhof or Schweizer Bahnhof) is the central railway station in the city of Basel, Switzerland. Opened in 1854, and completely rebuilt in 1900\u20131907, it is Europe's busiest international border station. As its name suggests, Basel SBB is owned by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). The other major railway station in Basel is Basel Badischer Bahnhof, which is on the north side of the Rhine from the city centre.\nTrains operated by SBB CFF FFS use Basel SBB to link Basel with destinations within Switzerland and Italy, as do Deutsche Bahn Intercity-Express (ICE) trains to and from Germany, Z\u00fcrich and Interlaken, most SNCF TGV trains to and from Paris, and some regional trains to and from Alsace. Additionally, the station is served by three lines of the Basel S-Bahn.\nThe 1907 neo-baroque station building is a heritage site of national significance. It also contains B\u00e2le SNCF (shown in SBB CFF FFS online timetables as Basel SBB Gl. 30-35, and in other online timetables as Basel SNCF), which is located through a border crossing and is used by other trains to and from France. Directly outside the station building is the Centralbahnplatz, which is a major hub of the Basel tramway network, and the Basel terminus of a direct bus service to the EuroAirport.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe station area is situated at the southern side of the city centre, in an elongated area between the Zoological Garden to the west and the Br\u00fcglinger Ebene to the east.\nThe borders of four of Basel's districts come together at the station area. However, the area is, according to the Statistical Office, divided between only two districts: the station itself is located in Gundeldingen, while most of the tracks on the eastern side of the station (including the goods station), along with the Centralbahnplatz in front of the station (including the BIS Tower), are attributed to the St. Alban quarter.\nThe Elisabethenanlage in front of the Centralbahnplatz belongs to Vorst\u00e4dte, while the Markthalle opposite Basel SNCF is part of the Am Ring district.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\n\nThe first railway to reach Basel, the Chemin de fer Strasbourg B\u00e2le (StB) (Strasbourg Basel Railway), arrived there in 1844. The following year, 1845, the Els\u00e4sserbahn (Alsatian Railway) built the first station in the Basel metropolitan area, within the city walls. Basel thereby became the first Swiss city to be connected to the new means of transport.\nAfter the arrival of the railway, there was a passionate debate in Basel about the pros and cons of the railway and its possible continuation into the Swiss Plateau and the Gotthard.\nMeanwhile, the Rheintalbahn from Mannheim and Karlsruhe also approached Basel from the north; in 1851 it reached Haltingen (a district of Weil am Rhein), on the Swiss border.\nIn 1853, the Schweizerische Centralbahn railway company (SCB) was founded in Basel. Its purpose was the establishment of a link between the city of Basel and the economic centres of the Mittelland cantons, and perhaps even also the expansion of the transport corridor from Lucerne to the Gotthard.\nThe Viaduktstrasse in Basel \u2013 including the Birsig Viaduct, which is adjacent to the Zoo Basel parking lot \u2013 was also the formation of the Els\u00e4sserbahn until 1902. Today, the viaduct serves tram lines 1 and 8, as well as motor vehicle traffic, and a plaque on the bridge railing recalls its earlier role as a rail bridge.\n\n\n=== Provisional station ===\nIn 1854, construction began on the future Hauenstein railway line. Right up until the opening of the first section of the route from Basel to Liestal, the controversial question of the site and design of the Basel railway station remained unresolved.\nHowever, to accommodate the commencement of railway operations on 19 December 1854, the Centralbahn built a simple temporary timber structure, according to plans developed by chief architect Ludwig Maring. By the opening day, all of the temporary station buildings had been completed, including a timber train shed.\nThis modest provisional station, equipped with makeshift facilities, was made up of individual detached buildings and was used only for just under six years. The station site consisted of the station building, a goods shed, a carriage and locomotive shed and a turntable at the railhead. As the station building stood on the northeastern side of the station, alongside the station yard, the station was not configured as a terminus.\nThe provisional station served only as the starting point of the SCB lines, and had no connection with either the French station or the Badischer Bahnhof, which was opened in 1855 as the terminus of the Rheintalbahn.\n\n\n=== Centralbahnhof ===\nOn 29 June 1857, the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt agreed to the construction of a link between the French line and the Centralbahn and the erection of a through station in the field in front of the Elisabethen-Bollwerk. The city bore the cost of the land purchase.\nAt the start of 1859, the SCB began construction work on the site of the new station, to a design by Maring. In addition to a passenger station, the new station yard featured a goods station relocated to the Gundeldingen district, and two new locomotive sheds, one of them for the SCB, and the other for the Chemins de fer de l'Est, which had taken over the StB in 1854.\nOn 4 June 1860, railway operations began at the new Basel Centralbahnhof. However, it was not until May 1861 that all the new facilities were completed.\nThe Centralbahnhof was a joint station, with the northern facade of its station building facing the newly created Centralbahnplatz. On each side of the station building were the boarding halls, each with two tracks \u2013 on the eastern side for the Swiss trains and on the western side and for the French trains. To the south of the station building were the goods shed and two large warehouses, with an access road from the G\u00fcterstrasse.\nIn subsequent years, modifications were made to the Centralbahnhof to enable it to deal with its substantially increasing traffic, including trains entering and leaving Basel along a number of new lines:\n\nThe connecting line between Basel Badischer Bahnhof and the Centralbahnhof, which was handed over to traffic on 3 November 1873.\nThe B\u00f6zberg Railway, which was opened on 2 August 1875; built by the B\u00f6tzbergbahn, a joint venture of the SCB and the Schweizerische Nordostbahn, it linked Basel with Z\u00fcrich via Pratteln and Rheinfelden.\nThe Jura Railway, which, from 25 September 1875, formed a connection from Basel into western Switzerland and the Franche Comt\u00e9, via its junction at Del\u00e9mont and branches to Biel/Bienne and Delle, respectively.However, the Centralbahnhof eventually ran out of capacity to handle any further additional traffic.\nIn 1875, as a first measure of relief, the marshalling of freight trains was relocated to a makeshift yard to the east of the station, on an open field known as \"auf dem Wolf\". At around that time, discussions began with the aim of lowering the tracks and replacing the troublesome urban level crossings on the Els\u00e4sserbahn and at the Centralbahnhof. In 1874, provisional timber pedestrian bridges had already been built at Margarethenstrasse und Heumattstrasse; they were later replaced by iron structures. From 1879, the Pfeffingerstrasse passed underneath the station in a tunnel near the present location of the Peter Merian Bridge.\nFinally, in 1898, following the referendum on the nationalisation of Switzerland's railways, the Swiss Federal Council decided to go ahead with the following:\n\nconstruction of a new Centralbahnhof on the existing site;\nlowering of the whole station area by 2.7 metres (8 ft 10 in);\nrelocation of the Els\u00e4sserbahn to a cutting, in a wide arc around the city;\nrelocation of the entire freight and warehouse facility to the provisional marshalling yard at \"auf den Wolf\".\n\n\n=== Provisional new Centralbahnhof ===\nThe definitive project for a new Centralbahnhof in Basel was developed in 1899. On 16 March 1900, the Federal Council gave approval to the plans.\nThe lowering of the whole station area and the access lines required careful planning. The first step was the relocation of goods traffic to the Wolf station, and on 12 May 1901 the Alsace line was reopened in its new lower position and wide arc.\nOn the vacated, lowered, area south of the original Centralbahnhof, the provisional station was built, and on 2 June 1902 it went into operation.\nAccess to the provisional station was also from the south, via G\u00fcterstrasse. To facilitate access, various streets were extended, as were two tram lines. The provisional station remained in operation until 24 June 1907. The provisional facilities and access roads were then dismantled and the two tram lines laid into G\u00fcterstrasse. A station underpass to Gundeldingen was built roughly in the location of the provisional access road.\nIn 1902-1903, the old station was torn down.\n\n\n=== Basel SBB station ===\nIn 1902, the Schweizerische Centralbahn was absorbed by the newly formed Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). The new station, which from then onwards was referred to as Schweizer Bundesbahnhof or Basel SBB, was one of the new Federal Railways' first large building projects. Designed by Emil Faesch and Emmanuel La Roche, the new station was inaugurated on 24 June 1907.\n\nThe Basel SBB station building is characterized by its extraordinary length: Basel SNCF, with its customs facility for the international transit traffic, is \"attached\" to its western side. The asymmetrical layout of the station creates an external appearance representative of the federal buildings of the time. The station building is aligned to the centre line of the Centralbahnplatz, and features a huge glazed tudor arch window between two clock towers under curved domes.\n\nBehind the facade, one might suspect a terminus, but that is not the case in Basel. Through the entrances in the clock towers, travellers reach the ticket hall under a timber-lined steel-arch structure. Like the rest of the interior, the ticket hall is broad and high. Large murals dating from the 1920s advertise tourist destinations in Switzerland. The ticket and currency exchange offices are embedded in the side wall. The baggage check-in and hand luggage storage facilities were formerly also located here, but today they are in the basement, and accessed by means of an escalator and stairs.\n\nIn the eastern part of the station, the baggage claim was formerly to be found where the travel centre is now located. The first/second class restaurants (now Migros) and the third class facility (now a brasserie/kiosk) were in the north west wing. The station was previously known for its station buffets, but these were gradually closed down in the 1990s. The high rooms, their walls decorated with murals, now house other commercial uses together with the sole remaining specialty restaurant.\nA separate entrance, on the Centralbahnstrasse west of the Centralbahnplatz, leads to the Alsace-bound trains at Basel SNCF. \n\nInitially, the platform allocation at Basel SBB corresponded to the private railway age, because the platforms were separated according to the direction of travel. The station originally had 10 tracks, of which the three bay platforms 1 to 3 were previously reserved for local traffic. Tracks 1 to 10 are spanned by a five aisle train shed, which was created in 1905 by Albert Buss & Cie. of Pratteln in Basel. The train shed is 93 m (305 ft) wide, and has a length of 120 m (390 ft) (tracks 1/2), 230 m (750 ft) (tracks 3/4) and 200 m (660 ft) (tracks 5-10). Track 4 goes through to Basel SNCF, where it becomes track 30 and the catenary can be switched from the Swiss operating current of 15 kV 16.7 Hz AC to its French equivalent, 25 kV 50 Hz AC.\nOn the southern side of the station, a double track line, located at a lower level, connects the Basel and Muttenz marshalling yards with the line to France, and is devoted mainly to through freight trains.\n\nDue to the lowering of the tracks at the time of rebuilding, it was difficult to extend the station with additional tracks. On the South side, the platform system has nevertheless been augmented several times: tracks 11 and 12 have been added, the pedestrian underpass has been extended to Gundeldingen, and, in 2003, the new Passerelle was constructed to the new tracks 14 and 15. These changes, together with the introduction of a clock-face timetable in 1982 and the Rail 2000 project, achieved an increase in the station's capacity. Finally, in June 2008, the new tracks 16 and 17 went into operation.\nThe Passerelle is an element of the new SBB CFF FFS commercial concept known as RailCity. Designed by architects Cruz and Ortiz, it runs over the tracks from the ticket hall at the western end of the train shed to the district of Gundeldingen, and links the platforms with each other. A walkway with shopping opportunities, it is 185 m (607 ft) long, 30 m (98 ft) wide, and replaced the pedestrian underpass. Today, the former underpass is used for operational and logistical purposes.\nWith the construction of the Passerelle, the RailCenter and the information display were relocated from the ticket hall to the former luggage hall. Additionally, the 1987-built customer service ticket pavilion in the ticket hall was removed, and since then the ticket hall has been able to unfold its ambience to its fullest extent.\nMeanwhile, in 1998 and 1999, a new signal box was constructed on behalf of the SBB CFF FFS. The architects of this striking building were Herzog & de Meuron.\n\n\n== Connections ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nAbout 1,000 trains depart from the station daily. Nearly every 90 seconds, a passenger train leaves or stops at the station. Additionally, freight trains still use the through tracks, and post office trains enter and exit the underground postal station.\n\n\n=== International long-distance trains ===\nAn ICE departs from Basel SBB every hour to Berlin or Hamburg and a number of other German cities. Several times a day, EuroCitys run to Milan, and TGVs to Paris. Night connections exist with Berlin, and Hamburg. There used to be a direct connection to Moscow but as of 2014 this has been discontinued.\n\n\n=== National long-distance trains ===\nSeveral times hourly, InterCity trains run to Z\u00fcrich HB, Bern and Olten. At least hourly, Z\u00fcrich\u2013Chur, Olten\u2013Lucerne\u2013Bellinzona\u2013Lugano, Olten\u2013Bern\u2013Interlaken/Visp\u2013Brig, and Del\u00e9mont\u2013Biel/Bienne\u2013Neuch\u00e2tel\u2013Lausanne/Geneva can be reached.\n\n\n=== Trinational regional trains ===\nAs a border station, Basel SBB is also aligned with regional services to Germany, France, and Switzerland. The Basel Regional S-Bahn network ranges from Frick/Laufenburg in the east, Olten in the south, and Porrentruy in the west to Mulhouse in the north west and Zell im Wiesental in the north east.\n\n\n== Services ==\n\n\n=== Long-distance trains ===\n\n\n==== International long-distance trains ====\n\nThe international long-distance routes served by trains to or from Basel SBB are as follows:\n\nICE (Chur \u2013 Landquart \u2013 Sargans \u2013) Z\u00fcrich HB \u2013 Basel SBB \u2013 Freiburg (Breisgau) Hbf \u2013 Karlsruhe Hbf \u2013 Frankfurt (Main) S\u00fcd \u2013 Hannover Hbf \u2013 Hamburg Hbf (\u2013 Kiel Hbf)\nICE Basel SBB \u2013 Freiburg (Breisgau) Hbf \u2013 Karlsruhe Hbf -

          "We spent here 2 wonderful hours with our children. Our kids were amazed. For just 14 CHF altogether.",
          "If you love toys this is the museum for you. I came here because I make dollhouse miniatures in 1:12 scale. I was looking for inspiration and this place didnt disappoint me. There were not so many people when we came here and it was on a \u2026",
          "This museum is a must visit! The historical toys, carousels and bear collection are just magical, but this time I went specifically for their special exhibition.\n Special exhibitions are very well put together every time, very educational \u2026",
          "Very interesting and particular museum. It combines art and history while demonstrating dolls from different sites and periods. I really enjoyed my visit.",
          "The word \"toy\" is not appropriate. In 90% they have only teddy bears, so \"Teddy bear world museum\" would be more accurate.\n\nAt least not expensive, and nice museum if someone is interested in teddy bears.",
          "While the installation is inspiring, it is \"old school\" to have only collections behind the vitrins. Missing interactive and inspiration is needed in todays museums.",
          "What a charming museum! With each look you discover more details in the exhibition. Wonderful place for children and grown ups who want to dream about past time childhood.",
          "The exhibition spaces, over four floors, was certainly impressive. The wide array of different types of toys combined with the sheer volume and diversity of different time periods/manufacturers made for an interesting wander around.\nAn \u2026",

          "Really, nice place for older children. Youngest one will get bored.\nBe aware that you can't leave the building and came back on the same ticket. In the UK in the most of the cases you can easily leave and come back on the same ticket. In my case I had to leave eat something as my kids felt hungry",
          "Very nice museum with lots of exhibition pieces lovely arranged.",
          "This was a really fun museum! There were so many detailed and intricate displays to look at! Many included Teddy bears, but there were other things too - hats, dolls, carnival and fair scenes.... I highly recommend a visit to this museum is you're in Basel :)",
          "Instead of a toy museum it should be called miniature world of era before 1900. Not a place to go with active kids. They will surely get bored. We spent in all 20 minutes in seeing 4 floors.",

          "In the stuffed animal exhibition, I could have easily cried as it was like stepping directly into the eyes and imagination of my childhood. The whimsical window displays with Steiff animals deeply touch my normally cold exterior and bring a \u2026",
          "Kids Love this place .Was called Puppenhaus museum some years back. Packed with bears, dolls and miniature working models of settings like a town fair, shops etc.",
          "The toy museum is a collection of old toys, puppets and teddy bears that is spread over 4 floors. One floor also shows a variety of extraordinary hats, some of them can even  be tried in for a fun picture. The different items are arranged \u2026",
          "Wonderful place. Easy to access via public transport.\nLift available to access all floors.",
          "Large toy museum that is child friendly. There are steps for them to stand on and toy horses to ride...",
          "A surprisingly decent museum! Most toy museums are a bit boring, but this one had some fun in it. Top floor teddy museum is cute to look at, but there isn't much interactivity.\n\nCurrently the special exhibition is AMAZING! A bunch of \u2026",

          "A fantastic museum that any child and most adults will delight in visiting. Four floors of exhibits including an extensive collection of teddy bears, costumes, intricate miniatures and doll's house displays. If you have kids this is a must see, and even if you don't it's probably still worth visiting.",
          "A verry nice museum",
          "Loads of teddy \ud83d\udc3b bears and incredibly realistic miniatures",
          "A cute little museum where I spent way more time than I thought I would. The models are incredibly intricate, some of them even moving, like an amusement park model. The teddy bears were adorable as well. Luckily, the people who set up this \u2026",
          "I will stay here forever :)",
          "Not sure about the place. I came on my own half an hour before closing time and i was just by myself in the whole museum. ITS CREEEPYYYY!!! Maybe im not used to see so many toys but i just felt im in some horror movie. Wouldn\u2019t take my child here :)",
          "Great for an hour but not interactive",
          "The Carnival Costumes exhibit was pretty interesting.  Tons of  bears everywhere else. Active exhibits were fun to watch.",

          "Toy-Wonderland, an excellent show of outstanding performance - absolutely beautiful! \u261d\ud83c\udffb",
          "Impressive collection of art. I insist it is art: this museum is mostly for adults to enjoy the art of miniatures, not so much fun for the little ones. Still, my son enjoyed automated toys --  ferris wheels, merry go rounds etc.",
          "More than great",
          "I would highly recommend this charming place to both adults and children. Miniatures and doll houses collections are huge and very impressive and teddy bear section is interesting too. Price is very reasonable at 7CHF.",

          "Decent fun place to visit but not somewhere you can spend too much time. It's slightly on the pricey side for what it offers but that's pretty much the same everywhere in Basel so don't let that put you off if you're in the area.",

          "Floor after floow of old toys abolutely packed into very large Displays. It is interesting, though, I think These toy came from a time Long before my childhood.",
          "This charming museum offers four floors of marvels. Teddy bears occupy one floor, dolls are on another. The best of all, though, are the miniature villages. They're very detailed and as a whole, stunning.",
          "We went to Spielzeug Welten Museum Basel with a few hours to burn on a rainy afternoon. The price was cheap (SFr.7) and it wasn't crowded. The current special exhibition is entitled \"Malevich, Kandinsky and Revolutionary Porcelain;\" art and white gold Russian masters from 1917",
          "We went With my 2 year old daughter and my 5 month old boy. It's an amazing museum with an unique collection of toys of all kinds. My daughter loved it.",
          "We really loved visiting this museum. We chose to go there on a whim and did not regret our choice. Each floor is cramped with a large collection of toys, dolls, teddy bears and doll houses. There are exhibits which are also interactive and light up, move and play music. We had",
          "I visited this museum for the teddy bear collection as I am 'in the business' of bears. I was not disappointed. A stunning collection of beautiful bears in very good condition. All nicely displayed with numbers to find out more about each one on the easy to use museum app.",
          "To access the museum, you pay at the counter at the shop on the ground floor. We started from the 4th floor and worked ourselves down. All sizes, types and kinds of teddy bears were on the top floor. Figurines and different \"doll\" houses galore. Don't forget the press on the",
          "Spielzeug Welten Museum Basel is a really nice museum where you can see the wax figure from the history.",
          "We almost walked past this as it looks like a store on the ground floor. After buying the ticket take the elevator to the 4th floor to begin visiting this packed museum of toys, dioramas and doll houses of great beauty and Swiss and Italian precision.",
          "I walked by this for a year before I finally went in. I kept thinking...where did this all come from? One (very wealthy) woman's personal collection. You just can't imagine how much is in this museum. It was surprising and really fun!",
          "My friend and I visited on our last morning in Basle. It just looks like a shop from the outside but don't be fooled. It is one of the best museum I've ever visited. 3 floors of toys and dolls' houses but that's not a fair description of what you see. Apart from hundreds of",
          "I went with my parents and kids thinking it was a nice stop for the kids, they actually enjoyed it, but the grownups thought it was really creepy... the lightening is really bad, summed up with the old toys... just creepy!",
          "I am not a dollhouse kind of person and reluctantly tagged along with my wife. I was wrong. The level of detail in the exhibits is something truly remarkable. They had plenty of seats at regular intervals which is good for the elderly and less able. I would definitely come back",
          "I've been collecting dollhouses since I was 11, so this was a real treat to find while we were stopping over in Basel. There are so many displays and beautiful dollhouses, that you'll want to take a good amount of time to take it all in. While most of the displays are behind",
          "This a great place to spend time , don't be in a rush ,it takes more then an hour.... great displays of miniatures doll houses , all different themes , a lot of Teddy bears, I would highly recommend this stop if you get the chance ,....\ud83d\udc4d",
          "As part of the museums night (pay one entrance fee and access that night almost all museums of Baesl) I went to explore this toy museum. First of all it is much bigger than you think. Displayed over 5 floors you will find antique toys (mostly teddies) distributed all over the",
          "We went in here on a Sunday and was not disappointed wonderful collection of teddies and beautifully set out in different displays very enchanting. Well worth a visit",
          "Nice range of toys on display, with a little search game for kids - about ten pictures of exhibits, with the challenge of finding which floor they're on. Get them all right, and collect a small prize as you leave.",
          "We went to the museum not knowing what to expect, but were taken aback by the beautiful collection of doll houses. They are mostly from late 1800's and early 1900's. I had my children with me, but I must say, it was me who was more fascinated and taken in by the doll houses.",
          "For a small fee you can see one of the best toy museums in the world Every period of time is represented and the automate toys are fabulous There is an interesting exhibition on advertising signs",
          "The name 'spielzeug' made us think it would be all kind of toys, but it was mainly teddy bears and dolls and doll houses. This made it less interesting to us. Perhaps we wouldn't have gone if we knew this beforehand. We spent about an hour inside and it was okay but nothing",
          "In the best possible sense of it. I've seen a few toy museums in different parts of the world by never anything remotely close to the teddy bear collection presented here. There are THOUSANDS of bears of all possible kinds including the earliest ones (1900th). They are exhibited",
          "It's quite nice museum, but not too many interesting things to do except watching toys behind the glass site. Nevertheless, they have a lot of seasonal exhibitions and the outside of the museum is always beautiful and interesting.",
          "The permanent exhibition is just worth it if you're really into toys, and more specifically old teddy bears and miniature houses. However, the museum usually also houses temporary exhibitions on topics as varied as old advertising, paper umbrellas or Marilyn Monroe, so if you're",

          "Miniature department is incredible. There are many teddy bears very old and maintained, guides with information about every toy.",
          "This was probably one of the most extensive toy museum I've visited. The miniatures section were very good and the detailed mini shops were incredibly intricate and fascinating. Highly recommended",
          "You may miss other attractions in the city, but not this one. Pictures not allowed. 4 floors of vintage teddy bears and toys. On your must-see list.",
          "The museum is over four floors and I can't imagine finding anything else like it in the world. The collection is massive, from teddy bears to doll houses to theme set shops. The painstaking workmanship is mind blowing, and while I was on overload after an hour my friend was",
          "An interesting variety of toys, and the most impressive collection of teddy bears I've seen. On the best possible location. I found the place itself a bit too dark, and most toys were exhibited behind glass vitrines (the Swiss don't trust the kids).",
          "So many teddy bears! The dollhouses were amazing - not just the usual ones showing the insides of houses, but model replicas of shops. Imagine playing with a toy pharmacy. (Probably many of them were for display only. But still, the detail is incredible.) The parasol exhibit",
          "This is a kind of awkward museum. It's filled with old teddy bears and puppet houses on 3 floors, the remaining floor is an limited time exhibition (when we visited there were umbrellas and umbrella handles). Although I'm not really into any of these I was blown away by the over",
          "Great place to go for a short visit on a regular day or for a longer day on one of their fantastic workshop days. Workshops are usually for free and are really thought through. Check on their website for details. Parents ca go for a nice coffee in their cute coffee shop.",

          "I visited Spielzeug Welten during the Night of Museums in Basel. All floors were packed with people, so I probably didn't see as much as I could during a normal visit. The collection of toys seems huge,you will need time to see everything if you pay attention to all the details.",
          "Although aimed at children, I think many adults will find Spielzeug Welten charming. It houses the largest teddy bear collection in Europe, and dozens of antique and contemporary miniature displays. There are also regional exhibits as well.",
          "IT is a wonderful museum to visit not just the children but also the adults. We do not have unfortunately many museums like this in Europe.",
          "This museum is 4 floors and features teddy bears and doll houses from over a ~200 year period. Some of the floors featured special exhibits (I visited December 2015, and the special exhibits included one on umbrellas/parasols, and another one on 500 years of cooking history full",
          "We chose this museum as we have a son and thought he would enjoy the display of toys. He was quite disappointed as it is mostly models and teddies. Not many real toys on display. Some of the attractions (food from the last 500 years... toys?) might interest some people and a",

          "Thoroughly enjoyed visit to the Museum, which is on 4 floors, and easily accessible. There is a restaurant which you can have various dishes. Staff were very helpful. It was wonderful to see the toys of years ago, and especially the working mechanical displays.",
          "Very beautiful and inspiring for any age group, not only children. Museum has four floors and a huge variety of installation. Never seen so many cute things in one place. There were the entire cities made from dolls and toys, everything very realistic. Not only toys, but also",
          "This is a fantastic museum of puppets, dolls, and stuffed animals. My friends poo-pooed it before I went, but I'm glad I insisted! Well worth the time and nominal cost of admission. I recommend it!",
          "I only recently learned all about Steiff bears and looked for a place tp purchase bears and this museum came up. The collection is incredible and it must be worth millions. If you are into teddy bears, Stieff bears, dolls, etc., this is the place to go. There are at least",
          "I love toys. So when someone says let's check out the toy museum I say, \"why not?\" You had better love stuffed bears. They must be here my the thousands. Then there are the dolls and doll houses. Wow. I can't imagine how many hours were spent putting each doll house",
          "My wife and I visited this museum in the hope that it would prove of interest. We were not disappointed. The exhibits are over four floors, and we enjoyed seeing the various bears, dolls, dolls houses and miniature presentations accumulated over the years.Well worth a visit to",
          "This museum is a must if you like teddy bears, dollhouses and old toys. The building is packed with dolls, working toys and all sorts of dollhouses. There is a shop with a fine collection of toys and dollhouse things. This is more for adults who have a hobby for dolls.",
          "This museum is more for kids who can keep their hands awa from things. It is beauiful wih old dall houses and special topcis all year around. Girls love it! Nice coffee shop.",
          "Anyone who has ever owned and loved a teddy bear or a doll, for that matter, must absolutely visit this excellent and singular museum which casts one back to a simpler time in one's life, filling one with nostalgia, joy, and even marvel at the ingenuity and painstaking work",
          "\"Don't touch anything in the museum shop! No strollers allowed! (Even though there were tons of strollers upstairs) You must stand outside the entrance of the museum (in the rain) to give your child a snack! (Even though the caf\u00e9 is steps away)\" this steady stream of DON'Ts were",
          "Usually noticed for its window display on a corner of the Barfuesserplatz: animated soft toys doing absurd things in a panorama of windows and buildings. You need to be a toy lover to really love this museum but it is quirky enough to charm the random visitor. Apart from",

But unless you\u2019re a huge fan, there\u2019s really only so long you can stare at floors and floors of teddy bears and dolls. There\u2019s also usually a special exhibit- when I was there, it was on the",
          "you really have to love teddy bears to appreciate this place. They often have great window displays but the interior was quite disappointing. There are a few animated displays but even children can only take so many teddy bears before getting bored. I would have appreciated",

          "This museum is rather odd, with its impressive collection of teddy bears and doll houses, one either loves it at first sight, or not. I appreciate the attention to details and amount of work into presenting and keeping all of the bears and dolls, but my young children have not",
          "What a treat to see so many stuffed bears, tin toys and astounding miniatures. The museum was mostly empty and we could take our time looking at the exhibits. There is so much to see it becomes overwhelming. It is worth the visit.",

          "Being a keen bear lover, we especially visited Basel to visit this lovely place. It is a wonderful museum with so many toys. I loved the computer where you could look up all the bear makers and read the whole history about their bears. A must see in Basel",

          "Yes it is a toy museum, but there is much more as there is always some additional exhibition. Last month I managed to catch the shoe exhibition and this month all paintings from years ago of the River Rhine. The toys are special, from dolls houses to teddy bears and fairgrounds",
          "weekends in Switzerland are difficult. So much closes. This is only open a few hours of a Saturday by the looks of it and you need to squeeze into a small lift to get to it. hard to find by stairs. I'm sure I would be fascinated if I was a toy collector.",
          "Loved it!So much to see and fun things to do. Was very crowded on the Night of the Museums though..obviously.",
          "Interesting, but not exceptional. The first contact is not really positive (no bag, no camera, no water, etc) no matter if we are with kids. No explanation on what we will see where. Dolls and teddy bears are interesting but again, no explanations provided, or at least, we",
          "This museum reminded me of my childhood. Its a beautiful museum a must visit for people with children as they would love to spend time there. Its quite well maintained and the way european and other cultures are shown in the form of dolls takes you to another world altogether.",

          "We saw this advertised on google when we searched What to do in Basel. We were thoroughly impressed. The ticket cost 7CHF and entry is free for under 16s. We started in the teddy bear exhibition. As we weren't really sure what the numbering system was for we sort of wandered",

          "Finest bear collection we've ever seen, hands down. If you're a fan of teddy bears - you'd be missing out by skipping this place. Have to be seen to be believed. Worth every Swiss Franc, especially if you're bringing kids along. Themed decorations were done with so much thought",
          "A fantastic collection of bears, dolls and dolls houses, with amazing moving displays from carousels to ferris wheels. So much time and effort has went into this collection. Definitely more for adults than children as these are proper collectors items. It's only 7 francs to",

          "Hundreds of toys (Mostly bears and dolls) beautifully displayed over 4 floors. Free entry for Swiss Pass holders. It's not an interactive museum. Kids are not going to enjoy peering at stuffed bears behind glass, even if the bears are riding a Ferris wheel. Collectors will love",
          "It's an excellent museum in the old town. A lot of toys from the past that we remember with joy but also with emotion. But it's not a place for children because the toys of the past are so different from the toys of today. If you are over 50 you must go there,it's amazing.",
          "This is a place to visit with Peter Pan, as you have the impression you are entering into Wendy's room. The biggest collection of Teddy bears ever, magical circuses, victorian houses, 19th century dolls .. A whole building full of generation of good times memories. Nice for",

          "We were there during a special Japanese exhibit. The price was worth going through the many floors of this museum. If you like dolls,teddy bears, diaramas, doll houses, etc , this is for you. No pictures are allowed but they do have postcards in the gift shop.",
          "I'm in agreement with the previous reviewer. Visited this museum (previously called the Puppenhausmuseum) perhaps with a misguided expectation that I would get to learn about the history of toys generally and how they came to be made.....etc. Spread over 4 floors, this museum",
          "It's good for young kids and people who have an interest in teddy bears and dolls. For teenagers and adults not really recommended.",
          "The 7CHF entrance fee is a bargain to see such a huge collection of teddy bears. The displays are well thought out and the sheer range of bears on display is incredible. I wasn't interested in the dolls (there are a lot on display for those who are) but loved the doll's houses",
          "We have visited this museum a number of times over the year and it just gets better and better. Their display of vintage teddy bears is without doubt the best in the world, even Steiff don't have the range and quality. They also have regular special exhibitions - the last we saw",

          "We didn't go inside on this visit, but did in 2007 when at Christmas markets. This is a wonderful collection of antique & collectors dolls, teddies and other toys - and has a diverse collection of \"artist\" bears made by artists from all over the world - I am lucky enough to",
          "This is one of those museums you can visit in 30 minutes or take over half a day. There's a great selection of teddy bears, old toys and doll's houses. With an interest in all of those we took over four hours to see everything with every display containing something special and",
          "Being a teddy bear fan, I enjoyed my visit and was amazed at the collection. The museum is over four floors starting out on the fourth floor which is home to the bears. On lower floors there are doll collections, doll houses, toys and displays that come to life at the push of",
          "I was a little hesitant to visit a doll/toy museum, but my kids (ages 5, 7) insisted and we really liked it. It's right off the Barfusserplatz tram stop and it had toys both my kids enjoyed. My daughter loved the dolls and doll houses, and my son loved all the doll-sized",
          "Nice place, you can cover it all for like 20-30 minuts. Can be great if you have kids. Generally it was ok, but if you are on budget its ok to skip.",

          "Conveniently situated near town square. Easy to reach by tram. My wife and I spent much more time there than we intended. The displays were beautifully done and there are 4 floors of dolls houses, dioramas from yesteryear, teddies, dolls and toy cars. The numbered displays were",
          "I can appreciate the grandeur of this collection and the effort that has gone into its display, but really, I finished my circuit through the four floors mentally drained. First, the good bits: the teddy bear and doll vignettes - there's a quirky sense of humour ever present",

          "If you had ever been to \"A Small World\" in West Perth, Western Australia and thought that was brilliant then you will be totally speechless when you visit this musuem. Small looking building from the outside it has floors and floors of dolls, bears, home scenes, doll houses,",
          "Lovely teddy bears, and the doll's houses were brilliant. It was lots of fun to see all the teddies and toys- a bit of childhood again.",
          "One of my favorite places. The decoration and displays are so fantastic that one can spend hours and hours just looking at all. The dolls are fantastic, the doll houses display warmth and cosyness. Thoughts, memories of childhood days came back and one became very sentimental.",
          "A delightful visit for anyone who loves teddy bears, there is a wealth of furry friends to look at and it's a must for any teddy lovers who are on holiday in Switzerland. The staff are all very friendly and helpful.",
          "It is worth to go there just for the nature of this museum by itself. It is a dollhouse museum. The exhibitions are, according to my knowledge, very unique worldwide, the museum gives a very interesting insight into what childhood actually is and has been. The special",
          "It is so crammed with old toys, of all sorts, that it is almost spooky. And it is not necessarily ideal for curious kids as everything is behind glass - cue fights for who gets to press the button to swing things into action, and heaven forbid that the button has already been",
          "Yes there is a huge collection of dolls, bears, doll clothing, houses, antique toys etc. but I have to say it was too overwhelming! There was wall to wall toys which at times even seemed creepy as doll faces leered our of their cases at you. This is definitely not the place for",

        "wiki": "The Basel museums encompass a series of museums in the city of Basel, Switzerland, and the neighboring region. They represent a broad spectrum of collections with a marked concentration in the fine arts and house numerous holdings of international significance. With at least three dozen institutions, not including the local history collections in the surrounding communities, the region offers an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other metropolitan areas of similar size. They draw some one and a half million visitors annually.\nConstituting an essential and defining component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museums of the canton of Basel-City arose from the 1661 purchase of the private Amerbach Cabinet by the city and the University of Basel and thus represent the oldest civic museum collection in continuous existence. Since the 1980s, a number of collections have been made public in new purpose-built structures that have achieved renown as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.\n\n\n== Museum landscape ==\nThe main focus of collecting among Basel museums is the fine arts \u2013 painting, drawing and sculpture. More than a dozen museums cover a spectrum that extends from antiquity up to the present and includes historic and established works of art as well as pioneering creations. In particular, the latter category has been made increasingly accessible to the public over the past two decades in a series of newly opened museums. There are collections with more of a local and regional character, yet a number of area museums, especially the larger institutions, are noted for their international orientation and reach. In addition, Basel benefits from a long tradition of collecting that, in contrast to many other museums in Central Europe, was not disrupted by the wars of the 20th century, as well as from the city's well-established connections to the market of art dealers and art collectors \u2013 such as through Art Basel.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nNumerous museums address various themes of cultural history and ethnology while other institutions feature technical and scientific collections. The museums continue to be oriented to the scholarly tasks of collecting, conserving and exhibiting as well as research and education or at least view these as part of their activities. Consistent with museological trends seen elsewhere, however, the traditional self-image has evolved since the 1960s. Alongside the new forms of public outreach (museum education and didactics), institutional hybrid forms have arisen that actively embrace a sociopolitically relevant role and in which museum operations constitute just one facet, albeit a highly important one, of a more comprehensive cultural institution.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWith the city's position at the junction of the \"Dreil\u00e4ndereck\" (Three-Countries Corner) and the compact municipal boundaries within the Basel region, most of Basel's museums are located in the city of Basel and thus in the canton of Basel-City but quite a few of museums lie in the canton of Basel-Country. The Basel museum landscape can also be said to extend to the museums of the greater metropolitan area, such as those in the neighboring towns of L\u00f6rrach, Saint-Louis and Weil am Rhein, with the latter included in the annual Basel Museum Night through the participation of Vitra Design Museum in Weil. In view of the numerous municipal, regional and national administrative units that come together here as well as the broader agglomeration, it is difficult to produce a conclusive figure for the number of Basel museums. Yet even when taking a narrowly drawn perimeter, the total comes to at least three dozen institutions that house collections and make them accessible to the public. The Basel museums are also part of the German-French-Swiss \"Upper Rhine Museum Pass\" that was introduced in 1999. This covers a much wider area than the Basel region, however, extending via Strasbourg up to Mannheim.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWith the increasing aestheticization of everyday life, the architecture of museums has taken on special significance since the 1980s. A striking number of exhibition structures have incorporated a vocabulary of postmodern and deconstructivist forms. In and around Basel, new buildings, additions or renovations have been constructed from designs by nationally and internationally renowned architects (Renzo Piano, Zaha Hadid, Frank O. Gehry, Wilfried and Katharina Steib, Herzog & de Meuron, Mario Botta) and celebrated as examples of avant-garde museum architecture. In other area museums, by contrast, the building fabric is old to very old, consisting of former residential and commercial buildings or monasteries and churches that have been converted for exhibition purposes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe museums are a central aspect of Basel's touristic appeal and hence an important economic factor. A number of Basel's museums are public institutions but the majority are privately sponsored, backed in most cases by foundations. Helping to generate the high density of museums compared to other cities and metropolitan areas of similar size, these private collections have also made a substantial contribution to the high level of museum quality. The private collections nearly all came into being after the Second World War. Most of the public museums, by contrast, date from before the war. In fact, the collections of the five publicly run museums of the canton of Basel-City have histories that go back several centuries.\n\n\n== Development of the museums ==\n\n\n=== Museums in the city ===\n\n\n==== Early collections ====\n\nThe origins of the first public collection are closely linked to the University of Basel and the early modern era collections of books, art and natural curiosities, of which there were quite a few in Basel. Prominent among them, the Amerbach printer family (founded by Johann Amerbach) had collected a substantial number of books, paintings, goldsmith works, coins and natural objects during the 16th century. In 1661, the Amerbach Cabinet was on the verge of being disbanded following a purchase offer from Amsterdam, then the European center for the trade in collector's items. At the urging of the mayor Johann Rudolf Wettstein, the city and university decided to jointly purchase the collection in order to keep it in Basel. Installed in the Haus zur M\u00fccke just off Cathedral Square in 1671, the collection did not operate like a museum. It principally served as a library for university scholars, with only a few parlors on the first floor reserved for works of art and natural objects. Two librarians were in charge of administering the overall collection.\n\nBeginning in the late 18th century, Basel saw an acceleration in the growth of collections of books and objects inspired by Enlightenment-era ideals of education and refinement. Significant holdings of antiquities, coins, fossils and natural curiosities made their way into the Haus zur M\u00fccke through purchases, gifts or bequests by private collectors. An especially important addition came in 1823 with the contents of the Museum Faesch, a Basel collection from the 17th century. The first coherent ethnological collection was formed from the \"Mexican cabinet\" that had been assembled by the merchant Lukas Vischer from 1828 to 1837 during his travels in Central America. In 1821, the natural objects and artifacts were separated out from the collections in the Haus zur M\u00fccke and an independent museum of natural history was established at the Falkensteiner Hof, likewise located right off Cathedral Square, which also included the instrument cabinets of the physics and chemistry institutes.The city's official repository for art was the Basel Town Hall (Rathaus) whose rich ornamentation and upkeep represented a constant undertaking for the city and a source of commissions for numerous artists from the early 16th century onward. The city armory likely had a \"museum corner\" starting in the 16th century. Following common practice, weapons that had become unfit for war were decommissioned for disposal. In Basel, however, a substantial number of them were preserved, which means that the armory caretakers wished to store the obsolete medieval or early modern militaria for the sake of memory value. The most prominent examples were the real and supposed trophies of the Burgundian booty from 1476, which had fallen to Basel and remained on display to curious onlookers centuries later. In contrast, the care and storage of the Basel Cathedral Treasury that had lost its liturgical value in the Reformation did not bear the character of a museum. Locked away in the cathedral sacristy for three centuries, the reliquaries and other religious objects remained inaccessible and out of view until 1833 and were merely listed as book value in the state budgets.\n\n\n==== First museum building ====\n\nIn 1767, the university professor Johann Jakob d\u2019Annone had the paintings and other objects moved to the previously empty ground floor of the Haus zur M\u00fccke to create more space for the books on the first floor, and also provided for a more systematic organization. A few decades later, however, the building and its infrastructure no longer accommodated the increased volume of visitors (with the facility open four days of the week starting in 1829) and the modern culture of knowledge established through the Enlightenment. Moreover, a comprehensive index of the holdings was lacking, having been \"altogether impossible heretofore in the inadequate premises where some pieces lay buried in darkened recesses for decades beneath an inch-thick layer of dust.\"The need for space was resolved in 1849 with the removal of the collection to the multi-purpose building by Melchior Berri on Augustinergasse \u2013 simply named the \"Museum\" \u2013 on the site of the former Augustinian monastery. It was financed with a one-time contribution from the canton along with citizen donations. The late classicistic monumental edifice with decorative painting and frescoes by Arnold B\u00f6cklin is a comparatively early example of a civic museum and the first major museum in Basel. While taking clear inspiration from Karl Friedrich Schinkel and his Academy of Architecture in Berlin, the allocation of spaces and functions here combined university facilities with a library and natural history and art collections. This also served the institutional requirements of the university. Further examples of collections could be found in most of the subsidiary institutes \u2013 i.e., facilities with demonstration objects for instruction and research purposes. These included the instruments of the chemistry and physics institutes and the utensils of the anatomical institute.\n\n\n==== Division of the public collections into state museums ====\n \nParallel to the specialization of the educational and research disciplines that took hold at the beginning of the 19th century, Basel's wide-ranging holdings of objects evolved into institutional collections divided according to various scientific fields. They were very different from the cabinets of curiosities that, according to the Basel professor Wilhelm Wackernagel, had merely involved \"[mindless grabbing] at curiosities with a half-pedantic, half-childish zeal\". The Natural History Museum (Naturhistorisches Museum) founded in 1821 was the first step in this new direction. In 1836, the art collection was made legally independent from the university library with a separate publicly funded art commission to oversee it. In 1856, the \"medieval collection\" took up residence in auxiliary rooms and annexes of the Basel Cathedral (Bishop's Court, St. Nicholas Chapel), having been established earlier that year with inventories from the Museum on Augustinergasse based on the model of the German National Museum in Nuremberg. In 1887, castings of ancient sculptures were put on display in the Sculpture Hall of the Basel Art Association (Basler Kunstverein). Meanwhile, in 1874, the chemistry and physics institutes had moved into the new Bernoullianum building for the study of the natural sciences, whereupon their holdings of objects shed their collection character in favor of laboratory facilities. The canton had difficulty amassing funding and support for the creation of another museum for its collections. The Museum on Augustinergasse had represented a formidable beginning, yet remained the only one of its kind for nearly fifty years.\n\nIn 1892, the \"antiquarian collection\" (small artifacts of antiquity, excluding ethnological objects) was joined with the medieval collection of the Basel Cathedral and historical weapons from the Basel Armory to form the Historical Museum Basel (Historisches Museum Basel), with exhibition space in the reconverted Barf\u00fcsser Church from 1894 onwards. Today this museum houses the Upper Rhine's most comprehensive collection of cultural history, showing artisanal crafts (Cathedral Treasury, goldsmith works, stained glass) and objects of everyday culture (furnishings, tapestries, coin cabinet). Major emphasis is placed on the Late Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque periods. The entire inventory of books was incorporated into the collection of the new University Library in 1896. The \"ethnographic collection\", which was given the title Collection of Ethnology (Sammlung f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde) in 1905, moved into new space created by an addition to the Museum on Augustinergasse in 1917, where it became the Museum of Ethnology (Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde). With holdings of approximately 300,000 objects and a comparable number of historical photographs, it is the largest ethnological museum in Switzerland and one of the largest in Europe. The collection includes objects from Europe, Ancient Egypt, Africa, Asia (Tibet and Bali Collections), Ancient America and Oceania. In 1944, the federal administration distinguished its European holdings as the Swiss Museum of Ethnology (Schweizerisches Museum f\u00fcr Volkskunde). However, since 1997 this division no longer exists; non-European and European collections are now joined in the Basel Museum of Cultures (Museum der Kulturen Basel), whose name intentionally expresses a change in emphasis from the presentation of \u201cforeign\u201d cultures to intercultural dialogue. The Natural History Museum Basel (Naturhistorisches Museum Basel), which features most areas of the natural sciences (anthropology, mineralogy, paleontology, vertebrates, insects including the Frey Collection of Beetles and other invertebrates), has not only remained in its original location since 1849 but has also retained its traditional name. Its collections, comprising nearly eight million objects which are also dedicated to scientific research, bear the title \"Archives of Life\".\n\nThe public art collection was installed in the upper story of the Museum on Augustinergasse in 1849. Its continuing growth led to increasing spatial demands that could not be met at that location. In 1936, after a planning period of roughly three decades, the art collection moved into the Kunstmuseum Basel. Satellite locations had already been established in 1922 at the Augustinerhof on Augustinergasse (collection of prints and drawings) and at the Bachofenhaus on Cathedral Square (Bachofen Collection with additional holdings). The greater part of the art collection was temporarily housed in the Kunsthalle from 1928 until 1936. The Kunstmuseum's gallery of paintings and collection of prints and drawings comprise the largest and most significant public art collection in Switzerland. With an emphasis on paintings and drawings by artists of the Upper Rhine from 1400 to 1600 (Holbein family, Witz, Cranach the Elder, Gr\u00fcnewald) and art of the 19th to 21st centuries (B\u00f6cklin, van Gogh, C\u00e9zanne, Gauguin, Cubism with Picasso and Braque, German Expressionism, postwar American art), it also ranks as one of the leading international museums of its kind. Since the removal of the art collection to new quarters, the Museum on Augustinergasse has served as the exclusive domain of the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Cultures/Museum of Ethnology (V\u00f6lkerkundemuseum/Museum der Kulturen). A major expansion of the public museum collections occurred in 1961 with the founding of the Basel Museum of Ancient Art and Ludwig Collection (Antikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig). This new institution combined previous holdings from the Historical Museum (small artifacts of antiquity) and Kunstmuseum (sculptures) with acquisitions from private collections, which are displayed in two neoclassical villas located opposite the Kunstmuseum. The Museum of Ancient Art opened in the first villa in 1966 and expanded into the adjacent structure, also built by architect Melchior Berri, in 1988. It is the only Swiss museum devoted exclusively to the art of the Mediterranean area (mainly Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, Italic and Roman cultures, as well as Levante and the Near East) from the 4th millennium B.C. to the 7th century A.D. The collections of Greek vases, Antique sculptures and Ancient Egyptian artifacts occupy a central position within its holdings.\n\n\n==== Satellite locations of the state museums ====\n \nThe growing spatial needs of the collections that were housed in the Museum on Augustinergasse led to the incorporation of neighboring buildings. Similarly, the other museums also expanded. The Historical Museum in Barf\u00fcsser Church acquired the following satellite locations: the Museum of Domestic Life (Wohnmuseum) in the Segerhof (1926\u201334) and its successor in the Haus zum Kirschgarten since 1951, the Museum of Domestic Culture in Basel (Museum der Basler Wohnkultur); the Museum of Music (Musikmuseum), featuring five centuries of European musical history based on the musical instrument collection founded in 1943, which has been displayed since 2000 in the former prison Lohnhof; the carriage and sleigh collection in Br\u00fcglingen, established in 1981. Replica casts of ancient sculptures that were originally on display in the Sculpture Hall (Skulpturenhalle), but moved into storage in 1927 due to a lack of public interest, became part of the Museum of Ancient Art (Antikenmuseum) in 1961 and again received their own exhibition space in 1963 in the new Basel Sculpture Hall (Skulpturhalle Basel). It features the world's only complete reconstruction of architectural sculpture from the Parthenon in Athens. The Public Art Collection (\u00d6ffentliche Kunstsammlung) also expanded into a second building in 1981 with the Museum of Contemporary Art (Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwartskunst) in St. Alban-Tal. As the first public exhibition building project in Europe, it is devoted exclusively to the presentation of contemporary works and artistic production since 1960. In addition to classic media such as painting and sculpture, its acquisitions also include video art.\n\n\n==== Defunct and semi-public museums ====\n \nThe Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum) was founded in 1878 by the Society of Trades and Craftsmen as a forum for the presentation of local arts and crafts. It became a semi-public institution in 1886 before coming under full public sponsorship in 1914. Renamed the Museum of Design (Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung) in 1989 due to its broadening thematic spectrum, it was closed in 1996. Affected by the same cuts in public funding was the architecturally oriented City and Cathedral Museum (Stadt- und M\u00fcnstermuseum), established in 1939 under the auspices of the public agency for the preservation of historic monuments in the former convent of Kleines Klingental. The holdings of the Museum of Design were distributed among other institutions, with the transferral of its library and poster collection to the School of Design (Schule f\u00fcr Gestaltung). Thanks to the support of a foundation, the City and Cathedral Museum remains on the same premises under the present name Kleines Klingental Museum.\nThe Swiss Firefighting Museum (Schweizerisches Feuerwehrmuseum), founded in 1957 as the Basel Firefighting Museum, is housed on the premises of the cantonal Fire Brigade but does not have the status of a public museum and is not administered by the canton. Its collection, which includes permanent loans from the Historical Museum, features documents that date back to the 13th century. The H\u00f6rnli Cemetery Collection (Sammlung Friedhof H\u00f6rnli) operates under similar conditions: It has been located on the property of the canton's Central Cemetery since 1994 but is funded and run by a private association. On display are burial objects such as urns, documents on the history of cremation, hearses, coffins, cemetery regulations, graveyard crosses, glass pearl chains and memorial keepsakes.\n\n\n==== Additional museums ====\n\nThe first museum that was not supported and administered by the canton of Basel-City was established in 1860 in a large room at the Basel Mission. It presented ritual and cultural objects from the countries and ethnic groups among which the Basel Mission was active, as well as a portrait gallery of its missionaries. However, parts of this exhibit were later sold to the canton and the gallery space was closed. The concept of a multi-purpose building, following the example of the Museum on Augustinergasse, was embraced by the Basel Art Society (Basler Kunstverein), which erected the Kunsthalle on Steinenberg between 1869 and 1872. In addition to exhibition space and administrative offices, this building housed a library and studio space for sculptors. A building wing added in 1885 accommodated the Sculpture Hall (Skulpturhalle), where the previously mentioned casts of Antique statues from the Museum on Augustinergasse were displayed from 1886 to 1927. The former Artists House (K\u00fcnstlerhaus) now defines itself \u201cas a hub between artists and art agents and as a place that brings together local and international developments.\u201d The next privately initiated museum was the above-mentioned Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum); founded in 1878, it came under cantonal administration just eight years later. The Anatomical Museum (Anatomisches Museum) of the University of Basel dates back to the acquisitional activities of Carl Gustav Jung in the 1820s. As the Collection of Pathology and Anatomy (Pathologisch-Anatomische Sammlung), it moved into its own building in 1880. Two especially significant objects in this collection are the oldest anatomical specimen in the world (prepared by Andreas Vesalius in Basel in 1543) and a skeleton prepared by Felix Platter in 1573.The Museum of Pharmacy (Pharmazie-Historisches Museum, originally the Historical Apothecary Collection) followed in 1924 after the donation of a private collection to the University of Basel. It is one of the world's largest collections on the history of pharmacy, encompassing old pharmaceuticals and early apothecary objects, laboratory utensils, ceramics, instruments, books, arts and crafts. The Swiss Gymnastics and Sports Museum (Schweizerische Turn- und Sportmuseum), established in 1945, was renamed as the Swiss Sport Museum in 1977. Sponsored by a foundation (Stiftung Sportmuseum Schweiz), its major focus is on ball sports, cycling, gymnastics and winter sports. The shipping museum Transport Hub Switzerland (Verkehrsdrehscheibe Schweiz) emerged from a 1954 exhibition by the Swiss Shipping Company (Schweizerische Reederei) in the Rhine ports of Basel, entitled \u201cOur Path to the Sea.\u201d It is also supported and run by an association of private citizens. The Swiss Historical Paper Collection (Schweizerische Papierhistorische Sammlung) was an affiliate of the Museum of Ethnology (Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde) from 1954 to 1979 before moving into independent quarters in the Gallician Mill, located in the former industrial district of St. Alban, in 1980. Now known as the Swiss Museum for Paper, Writing and Printing (Schweizerisches Museum f\u00fcr Papier, Schrift und Druck), it is sponsored by the Basel Paper Mill Foundation (Stiftung Basler Papierm\u00fchle). The Jewish Museum of Switzerland (J\u00fcdisches Museum Schweiz), which presents the cultural history of Jews in Switzerland and in Basel including documents from the First Zionist Congress held in Basel in 1897, was founded by the Society for the Jewish Museum of Switzerland in 1966.\n\nLike the Kleines Klingental Museum, the Klingental Exhibition Gallery (Ausstellungsraum Klingental) is located in the building complex of the former Klingental convent. Opened in 1974, the gallery serves as a presentation platform for the current work of artists living in Basel and aims to support emerging artistic talents. It is sponsored by the Klingental Gallery Society (Verein Ausstellungsraum Klingental). The Caricature and Cartoon Museum Basel (Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel), by contrast, was initiated by an individual, the collector and patron Dieter Burckhardt. Founded in 1979, it is devoted to caricatures, cartoons, comics, parodies and pastiches. The eponymous foundation (Stiftung Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel) is a dependent affiliate of the Christoph Merian Foundation. The exhibition galleries have been located in a structure from the Late Gothic period since 1996, following the completion of renovations and a new building addition by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. The Swiss Architecture Museum (Schweizerisches Architekturmuseum), founded in 1984, has resided since 2004 in the building complex of the Kunsthalle, which was completely renovated and redesigned by the architectural offices Miller & Maranta and Peter M\u00e4rkli. The museum, sponsored by the Architecture Museum Foundation, presents alternating exhibitions on topics of international architecture and urbanism. An advantageous factor is the unusual concentration of internationally renowned architectural firms in Basel; Herzog & de Meuron, in particular, have made significant contributions to regional museum architecture.\nOpened in 1996, the Tinguely Museum features a permanent exhibition on the life and work of the artist Jean Tinguely. The museum's temporary exhibitions present works by friends and contemporaries of Tinguely, as well as other modern artists. Designed by Mario Botta, the museum is financed entirely by the Basel pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche. The Dollhouse Museum (Puppenhausmuseum) was founded in 1998 by its patron and owner Gigi Oeri, who built up the collection herself. In addition to dolls, dollhouses and miniature shops from the 19th and 20th century, it displays the world's largest collection of teddy bears. The media art space [plug.in] opened its doors in 2000 with the backing of the Forum for New Media Association (Verein Forum f\u00fcr neue Medien), which had been founded the previous year. It realizes exhibitions and projects, provides artists with international networking opportunities and helps convey works of media art to the general public. With one of the world's most extensive collections of photographs (around 300,000 works with an emphasis on industrial society in the 19th century), the Herzog Foundation has exhibited its holdings since 2002 in a \u201cLaboratory for Photography\u201d. Located in the Dreispitz industrial sector, the warehouse converted by Herzog & de Meuron encompasses the collection along with a reference library on the history of photography and two additional rooms for study, teaching and research purposes.\n\n\n=== Museums in surrounding communities ===\nMany of the small and mid-sized municipalities around Basel have museums of local history and culture that are not presented in the following. Mention is given to institutions whose scope extends beyond the local level and which are generally open to the public several days a week.\n\n\n==== Collections of natural, cultural and technological history ====\nThe oldest museum in the Basel region outside the city is the Museum of Canton Basel-Country (Museum des Kantons Basel-Landschaft) in Liestal, nowadays called Museum.BL. It was founded in 1837 as a \"Cabinet of Natural Curiosities\" (Naturaliencabinett) and up through the 1930s primarily took up objects of natural history into the collections. Since then, the emphasis has shifted toward cultural history. The diversity of the collection allows the museum to address wide-ranging themes related to the environment, history and the present day. The Museum am Burghof in L\u00f6rrach traces its origins to the L\u00f6rrach Antiquities Association (L\u00f6rracher Altertumsverein) founded in 1882, which bequeathed its collection to the town of L\u00f6rrach in 1927. Commencing operations in 1932 as the Museum of Local History (Heimatmuseum), the current permanent exhibition \u201cExpoTriRhena\u201d presents the history, present-day culture and divisions and similarities within the \"Dreil\u00e4ndereck\" (Three-Countries Corner) border region where Germany, France and Switzerland meet.\n\nOpened in 1957, the Roman Museum at Augst (R\u00f6mermuseum Augst) is an open-air museum on the grounds of the former Roman city of Augusta Raurica, which has been the subject of excavations going back to the Renaissance. The exhibits feature numerous archaeological finds, including the largest silver treasure from Late Antiquity. The adjacent reconstruction of a Roman House (R\u00f6merhaus) was a gift of the Basel patron Ren\u00e9 Clavel while the museum and the entire archaeological park constitute a departmental division of Basel-Country. Located in the Br\u00fcglinger Plateau, the Mill Museum (M\u00fchlemuseum) of the Christoph Merian Foundation is housed in the water mill of the former Br\u00fcglingen farming estate. The structure was converted into a museum in 1966 and presents the history of the mill and the work of millers from the Bronze Age up to the 20th century. The mill is still functional, allowing periodic demonstrations of the operational sequence from the water-powered mill wheel to the rotating millstone.\nOpened to the public in 1972, the Toy Museum and Village and Wine Cultivation Museum (Spielzeugmuseum, Dorf- und Rebbaumuseum) in Riehen complements its exhibits of village history and wine growing with one of the most significant collections of European toys. The toys are drawn from private collections as well as loans from the Museum of Cultures (Museum der Kulturen). The museum is operated as a division of the municipal administration of Riehen. The Museum of Music Automatons (Museum f\u00fcr Musikautomaten) in Seewen, located on the outermost periphery of the Basel museum territory, houses one of the world's largest and most well known collections of Swiss music boxes, disc music boxes, musical timepieces and jewelry and other mechanical musical automatons. It opened to the public in 1979 as a private museum of the collector Heinrich Weiss and was gifted to the Swiss Confederation in 1990. A newly remodeled and expanded facility for presentation of the exhibits was completed in 2000. Finally, the Museum of Electricity (Elektrizit\u00e4tsmuseum) of the electric utility Elektra Birseck opened its doors in M\u00fcnchenstein in 1997. Exhibits explore the history and development of power production and its use. The collection contains rare historic equipment and is complemented by a laboratory in which visitors can experiment with electric power.\n\n\n==== Emphasis on art collections ====\n\nSince the late 1980s, the Basel region has seen a proliferation of new museums addressing themes of art and design, especially concerning works from more recent years. The Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein presents a broad range of design topics, with a special emphasis on furniture and interior design. Though originally based on the private collection of chairs and other furniture assembled by Rolf Fehlbaum, the owner of the Vitra furniture company, the museum was established as an independent institution. The Vitra building complex has made notable contributions to the body of avant-garde architecture in the Basel region. In addition to the 1989 museum by Frank O. Gehry, the grounds feature structures by Zaha Hadid, Nicholas Grimshaw, Tadao Ando and \u00c1lvaro Siza. In 1982, the Beyeler Foundation assumed ownership of the art collection of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler, which the couple had built up over half a century. Since 1997, the works of classical modern art have been exhibited in a building designed by Renzo Piano in the town of Riehen. Featured artists include Degas, Monet, C\u00e9zanne, van Gogh, Picasso, Rothko, Warhol, Lichtenstein and Bacon. The trees in the park surrounding the highly acclaimed building were wrapped by Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1998.\n\nWith the creation of the Basel-Country Art Museum (Kunsthaus Baselland) in Muttenz, the Basel-Country Art Association (Kunstverein Baselland) was given its own dedicated exhibition building in 1997. The Art Museum is devoted to contemporary art and presents temporary exhibitions of current projects by regional and international artists. Opened in 1998, Riehen Art Space (Kunst Raum Riehen) is another public institution with a similar thematic orientation. It serves the municipality of Riehen and its art commission with exhibitions of contemporary works of art from the region. Established in 2001, the Sculpture at Schoenthal Foundation in the former Sch\u00f6nthal monastery presents over twenty works by international and Swiss artists in a permanently accessible sculpture park under the motto \u201cArt and Nature in Dialogue\u201d. A Romanesque-era church has been converted into a gallery for temporary exhibitions of contemporary artists. In 2003, the Schaulager (or \u201cviewing warehouse\u201d) of the Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation was opened in M\u00fcnchenstein. Centered on the avant-garde art collection of the foundation, the institute functions as a mix between public museum, art storage facility and art research institute. The polygonal building is a design by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. The Fernet Branca Contemporary Art Space (Espace d\u2019Art Contemporain Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, the Alsatian town just across the border from Basel, is located in the former Fernet-Branca spirits distillery that was decommissioned in 2000. Since 2004, the museum has presented temporary exhibitions on contemporary art themes and artists. The museum's operations are supported by the Association for the Fernet Branca Contemporary Art Museum (Association pour le Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Contemporain Fernet Branca).\n\n\n== Museum promotion and museum policy ==\n\n\n=== Primacy of the library ===\n\nMany museums can be traced back to courtly collections \u2013 at least in terms of the original set of holdings. Since the 19th century, in contrast, Basel has embraced a culture of remembrance of having created the oldest existing civic museum collection through its purchase of the Amerbach Cabinet in the year 1661. The acquisition of a collection from the 16th century fits with the historical and documentary interest in art that was prevalent at the time. In fact, however, the purchase was chiefly prompted by a desire to enhance the university's inventory of books with the extensive book holdings of the Amerbach Cabinet. The Haus zur M\u00fccke community hall that housed the university-administered collection was called the \u201cLibrary\u201d in recognition of its primary function. The role as the city's art repository did not shift from the Basel Town Hall (Rathaus) to the Haus zur M\u00fccke until the latter half of the 18th century. The Passion Altarpiece by Holbein that had been one of the main visitor attractions since the Reformation was moved over in 1770, followed by several additional paintings from the town council's inventories in 1771 and Holbein's organ doors from the Cathedral in 1786. Despite this weighting of the collections, the official legal status remained unchanged for quite some time. The natural history holdings and art collection were not split off from the library until 1821 and 1836, respectively.\nAt the end of the 18th century, civic museum culture was still in the early stages of its development, as illustrated by the very limited opening hours of the Haus zur M\u00fccke (Thursday afternoon from two to four in the afternoon, otherwise on request). The first records of regular gallery visits by city residents and outside visitors date to this period. In the three centuries before and after 1800, most of the collection activities involved objects of natural history, with a substantial number of acquisitions and gifts in this area. The numerous top-level art objects that made their way to Basel in the 1790s from Revolutionary France, on the other hand, did not find a wide audience of buyers and in most cases were resold.\n\n\n=== Transfer to the state and popular education ===\nFor the republican and monarchical civic states of the 19th century, collections in the form of public museums became emblems of self-determination. The carting off of large numbers of artworks to Paris during the Napoleonic Wars had created an awareness of the identity-shaping power of art. Institutional role models were the \u201cMus\u00e9e fran\u00e7ais\u201d in the Louvre and the \u201cMus\u00e9e des monuments fran\u00e7ais\u201d in a former Augustinian convent, which closed in 1816. The maintenance of programmatic museum collections and the construction of museum buildings became one of the most prominent and defining national functions.In the case of Basel, however, it was the increasing need for space in the Haus zur M\u00fccke that prompted deliberations regarding construction of a new building. The discussion concerning the right location for the public collection took on a political dimension following the division of the canton into city and regional sections. The University Act (Universit\u00e4tsgesetz) of 1818 had made the corporatively autonomous university a cantonal educational establishment, with the university holdings thus owned indirectly by the state. According to the arbitral decision governing the cantonal split, two-thirds of the university's collection belonged to the regional canton and had to be purchased by the city canton. The ensuing consternation in the city led to the Administration and Use of University Holdings Act (Gesetz \u00fcber Verwaltung und Verwendung des Universit\u00e4tsgutes) of 1836 that such goods were indissolubly tied to the locality of the city of Basel for the purposes of education. This provision has remained in effect to the present day.\n\nThese occurrences led to the founding of the Voluntary Academic Society of Basel (Freiwillige Akademische Gesellschaft) in 1835, which began supporting the collections in financial terms and through purchases and gifts as part of its general promotion of the university. Yet the greatest momentum for the museum building came from natural science circles centered on the physics and chemistry professor Peter Merian, who was likely responsible for securing a dedicated annual budget for the Natural History Museum \u2013 the only state collection with this distinction. A combination of academic institution, library and laboratories, the establishment of the Natural History Museum at the Falkensteiner Hof also provided a model for the museum building. The fact that a primary museum building was ultimately created instead of a university-affiliated building was due to the university's poor standing among wide sections of the merchant and industrialist classes. In these sectors, the university was considered a backward-looking institution. The museum, by contrast, was seen as a driving force for practical popular education and the community was willing to support its construction with private contributions as part of a wider process of renewal in the city.\n\nAt the instigation of Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein, the Voluntary Museum Association of Basel (Freiwilliger Museumsverein) was initiated in 1850 as the successor to an earlier association founded in 1841 for the construction of the museum. Modelled after the Royal Institution in London, it was established to \u201cstimulate the appreciation of science and art\u201d. Open to all residents of Basel, the association promoted the collections with financial means and sought to generate interest in the museum through public lectures to which women were also admitted. It was unable to sustain the initial enthusiasm, however, and experienced losses in membership despite Basel's rapid population growth in the latter half of the century. The museum did not embrace the function of popular education that had been promoted by its founders and supporters. The ideational socialization role of the museum was very slow to proceed, with the museum long holding onto former organizational structures. The art collection furthermore did not get an academically trained conservator until 1887. In addition, the renewed University Act of 1866 discontinued regular state appropriations for the antiquarian, medieval and art collections and left them dependent on proceeds from entry fees and the support of associations and private individuals, the most significant of these being the Birrmann Foundation and the Emilie Linder Foundation on behalf of the art collection. It was this support that enabled an active collection policy that went beyond the receipt of inherited cultural assets.\n\n\n=== Civic culture of remembrance and modernism ===\n\nFrom the outset, the museum authorities charged the collections with a federal mission, wanting them to exert a \u201cbeneficial and salutary influence on the entire Fatherland\u201d. The \u201cunofficial national gallery\u201d grew over time, primarily through acquisitions of Swiss works of art. When negotiations got underway in 1883 regarding the establishment of a federal museum, the canton of Basel-City sought to be chosen as the location for the new institution and proposed its collections of cultural history as the nucleus of the museum, systematically expanding them in light of its candidacy. While the Swiss National Museum (Schweizerisches Landesmuseum) ended up in Zurich, plans were nevertheless realized for a history museum that was no longer generally Swiss but specifically related to Basel, located in the historic former Barf\u00fcsser Church from the High Gothic period. The establishment of the Historical Museum \u201cwas a self-assured display of Basel\u2019s art-mindedness and craftsmanship, a mix of educational corridor and enfilade of stalls\u201d. The transfer of the Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum) to the state a few years earlier as an arena of contemporary achievements can likewise be seen under the aspect of civic pride and reinvented sense of commonality in which the citizenry understood its ideals and capabilities as a foundation of state and society.\n\nWhile the collections had clearly established their international standing, this appreciation did not become rooted in the cultural awareness of a broader range of social classes until the end of the 19th century. The historic culture of remembrance that was growing in importance and impact at the time was strongly linked with the medieval collection and the many Late Medieval and Renaissance works of the Upper Rhine in the Kunstmuseum. In the years since, Basel has also cultivated its claim of possessing the oldest municipal art collection in continuous existence through its acquisition of the Amerbach Cabinet. On the occasion of two major public celebrations in 1892 (500th anniversary of Greater Basel's acquisition of Lesser Basel) and 1901 (Basel's 400th anniversary as part of the Swiss Confederation), Basel presented the civically minded portion of the population (and hence the base of support for the museums) with a series of identity-shaping historical and patriotic gestures that borrowed from the store of images from the past available in the museums.\n[[File:Franz Marc-The Fate of the Animals-1913.jpg|thumb|Franz Marc: Animal Destinies, 1913. The painting was offered by the German Reich in 1939 as \u201cdegenerate art\u201d and purchased by the city of Basel.]]\nWith the epochal break of the First World War and in light of societal and cultural developments, the Basel museums became concerned with the citizenry's assertions of legitimacy and quest for recognition and their representation within these very same institutions. The discussions regarding the relationship of the museums to modernism took on particular relevance in the area of the fine arts. The construction of a dedicated museum for Basel's art collection ignited a \u201cmonumentality debate\u201d in the late 1920s, in which the proponents of functionally oriented New Building (Neues Bauen) rejected the timelessly classic palatial form that was ultimately chosen as a demonstration of power by a conservative and \u201cintellectually spent\u201d notion of culture. In contrast to the form of architectural expression and the general anti-modernistic spirit of the 1930s, the acquisitions from the 1920s up to the outbreak of the Second World War took a decisively modern tack. In 1934, the public art collection added its first painting by Vincent van Gogh along with an ensemble of 134 drawings by Paul C\u00e9zanne. Founded in 1933, the Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation supported the Kunstmuseum in these efforts and took up residence in the facility with its works of contemporary art in 1940. The breakthrough in altering the overall profile came with the special funding credit provided by the Basel-City parliament in 1939 at the instigation of museum director Georg Schmidt for the purchase of German museum holdings that the National Socialists had vilified as \u201cdegenerate art\u201d.\n\nThe establishment of classical modernism at the Kunstmuseum continued with ongoing acquisitions of postwar-era art, in particular with works by American artists. In Basel's claim to being a \u201cMuseum City\u201d, the highly controversial and unsuccessful referendum against the purchase of two Picasso paintings in 1967 holds considerable importance and constitutes a key moment in Basel's culture of remembrance in regard to the fusing of society and museum.\n\n\n=== Democratization, popularization ===\nDespite the affirmation by voters, traditional museums found themselves in a prolonged crisis beginning in the late 1960s. Not limited to Basel, this crisis originated in the profound sociopolitical reevaluation of culture of the era. The acquisitions of the State Art Credit and the 1967 Christmas exhibition at Kunsthalle Basel set off fierce protests among the loosely organized association of rejected artists, which became known as the Farnsburg Group (Farnsburgergruppe). Even the cantonal parliament got involved in addressing the concerns. The events raised the question of whether Basel was \u201cjust a museum city\u201d \u2013 here meant in a derogatory sense \u2013 and prompted a broadly cast debate over the fostering of young artists and the functioning of the museums. The establishment of the Klingental Exhibition Gallery (Ausstellungsraum Klingental) several years later was a direct consequence of the shortcomings that had been identified.\n\nThe democratization that took hold in the 1960s meant doing away with the elite in favor of the egalitarian, dispelling fears of the new and unknown. With a focus on the constructivist  works of the 1960s associated with the \u201cNew Tendencies\u201d (Nouvelles Tendances) movement, the short-lived Progressive Museum (1968\u20131974) set out to \u201cestablish a modern collection that would be accessible to the public from the very beginning\u201d and wanted to avoid any sort of \u201csecularized ceremony\u201d. The expansion of education and communication, likewise a mandate stemming from this era, could only be achieved through an increase in funding. Since the mid-1970s, however, increasingly tight budgets and persistent financial difficulties in the public sector have exerted a palpable impact on museums. The museum studies program at the University of Basel could only be offered from 1992 to 1994 due to funding shortages. In the mid-1990s, a government resolution cut the budget of the state museums by ten percent, leading to the 1996 closure of two museums, the Museum of Design (Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung) and the City and Cathedral Museum (Stadt- und M\u00fcnstermuseum). The ensuing debate and the pressure from a public referendum in support of the city's museums led to the adoption of the Basel-City Museums Act (Museumsgesetz) of 1999, which placed the holdings of the remaining five state museums (Museum of Ancient Art, Historical Museum, Kunstmuseum, Museum of Cultures, Natural History Museum) in the hands of the parliament. As a central component of cultural expenditures, the museums have also been included in the intensified negotiations over the past several years between the two Basel cantons regarding payment for the city-provided services within the framework of a fiscal equalization scheme.\n\nSince the 1980s, the museums have experienced simultaneous trends toward popularization and aestheticization. The ensuing decades have been marked by a wave of new museum buildings whose avant-garde architecture has achieved international prominence. Contributing considerably to popularization was the exhibition concept of the Mus\u00e9e Sentimental, which focuses on the world of un-prosaic everyday culture and experience and led to a 1989 exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Design (Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung). The annual Basel Museum Night tallies around a hundred thousand museum visits while the museums attract a total of approximately 1.4 million visitors throughout the year (as of 2006). The general population credits the museums with \u201ca leading role in providing leisure-time opportunities for education and learning\u201d. Museums operate in an environment that is increasingly subject to the conditions of both the leisure market and the free market, and are recognized as an important economic and locational factor. In contrast to the state, the use of private funds in the museum field has grown considerably. Funding from patrons or sponsors plays an increasingly significant role in the financing of exhibitions, parts of collections or entire museums and is thus highly sought after. This competitive situation is further reflected in the considerable institutional autonomy of the Basel-City museums, which are the only governmental enterprises in the canton operating under the private-sector influenced method of New Public Management.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nBirkner, Othmar; Rebsamen, Hanspeter (1986).

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany. As of 2016, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018). The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007. Basel is the most densely populated city in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBasel has an area, as of 2009, of 23.91 square kilometers (9.23 sq mi). Of this area, 0.95 km2 (0.37 sq mi) or 4.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.88 km2 (0.34 sq mi) or 3.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.67 km2 (7.98 sq mi) or 86.4% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.45 km2 (0.56 sq mi) or 6.1% is either rivers or lakes.Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 10.2% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 40.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 24.0%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.7% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 8.9%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 2.5% is used for growing crops and 1.3% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen system, Basel features a continental-influenced oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), due to its relatively far inland position. The city averages 120.4 days of rain or snow annually and on average receives 842 mm (33.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Basel receives an average of 99 mm (3.9 in) of rain. The month with the most days of precipitation is also May, with an average of 12.4 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 45 mm (1.8 in) of precipitation over 8.4 days.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThe city of Basel functions as the capital of the Swiss half-canton of Basel-Stadt, though several of its suburbs are located in the half-canton of Basel-Landschaft or the canton of Aargau. Others are even located in France and Germany.\n\n\n=== Canton ===\nThe canton Basel-Stadt consists of three municipalities: Riehen, Bettingen, and the city Basel itself. The political structure and agencies of the city and the canton are identical.\n\n\n=== City ===\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nThe city itself has 19 quarters:\n\nGrossbasel (Greater Basel):\nKleinbasel (Lesser Basel):\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is In Silber ein schwarzer Baselstab. (Argent, a staff of Basel sable)\n(For \"staff\", see Heraldsnet website.)\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe canton's executive, the Executive Council (Regierungsrat), consists of seven members for a mandate period of 4 years. They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority. The president (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election, while the heads of the other departments are appointed by the collegiate. The current president is Dr Guy Morin. The executive body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (German: Rathaus) on the central Marktplatz. The building was built in 1504\u201314.\nAs of 2016, Basel's Executive Council is made up of three representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party), and one member each of Green Alliance of Basel (GB) (who is the president), FDP (Free Democratic Party), LDP (Liberal-Demokratische Partei of Basel), and CVP (Christian Democratic Party), giving the left parties a combined four out of seven seats. The last election was held on 23 October and 27 November 2016.\n\nBarbara Sch\u00fcpbach-Guggenb\u00fchlis is State Chronicler (Staatsschreiberin) since 2009, and Marco Greiner is Head of Communication (Regierungssprecher) and Vice State Chronicler (Vizestaatsschreiber) since 2007 for the Executive Council.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe parliament, the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt (Grosser Rat), consists of 100 seats, with members (called in German: Grossrat/Grossr\u00e4tin) elected every 4 years. The sessions of the Grand Council are public. Unlike the members of the Executive Council, the members of the Grand Council are not politicians by profession, but they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020. The legislative body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (Rathaus).\nThe last election was held on 23 October 2016 for the mandate period (Legislatur) of 2017\u20132021.

The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%. As of 2008, there were 18 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 9 businesses involved in this sector. 34,645 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,176 businesses in this sector. 120,130 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 8,908 businesses in this sector.

About 23.9% of the workforce coming into Basel are coming from outside Switzerland, while 1.0% of the locals commute out of Switzerland for work. Of the working population, 49.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 18.7% used a private car.\n\nThe Roche Tower, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, is 41 floors and 178 metres (584 ft) high, upon its opening in 2015 it has become the tallest building in Switzerland. Basel has also Switzerland's third tallest building (Basler Messeturm, 105 m (344 ft)) and Switzerland's tallest tower (St. Chrischona TV tower, 250 m (820 ft)).\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nThe Swiss chemical industry operates largely from Basel, and Basel also has a large pharmaceutical industry. Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel.

It was held from 2007 to 2019 and took place in Kleinbasel on the right bank of the Rhine.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBesides Humanism the city of Basel has also always been very famous for its achievement in the field of mathematics. Among others, the mathematician Leonhard Euler and the Bernoulli family have done research and been teaching at the local institutions for centuries.

Some of the best ATP-professionals play every year at the Swiss Indoors, including Switzerland's biggest sporting hero and frequent participant Roger Federer, a Basel native who describes the city as \"one of the most beautiful cities in the world\".\nThe annual Basel Rhine Swim draws several thousand visitors to the city to swim in or float on the Rhine river.While football and ice hockey are by far the most popular sports, basketball has a very small but faithful fan base. The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

          "attending a concert of early baroque music given by my favorite vocal ensemble was a gorgeous experience, acoustics are fantastic in this church",
          "We only saw the outside but did not go inside. Smaller church dating from the 1200's . Has brick building white washed on one side & red sandstone on the other side.",
          "I had the opportunity to visit the Peterskirche in Basel. It is a beautiful church, and is meticulously maintained. Of particular note are the bells that rang so brilliantly at 1900 hours on Saturday evening. It's worth a visit to sit, and pray to our Creator.",
          "This site is located on Peter's Church Square, near to the Mittlere Brucke and Botanic Garden. Just as we were at the times around the Middle Bridge, we went to the square where is situated this church, dating from 1219,although there was a religious building on the site before",
          "We went to a 5pm performance of the Bach Christmas Oratorio Cantata 1 by Musica Fiorita. We enjoyed singing along in the chorales, as words and music for them were supplied. No admission fee, voluntary collection afterwards.This was not just a concert performance - our German",

          "The church was closed on the two occasions we went to the square. There was a market on one day and it was interesting to see what people were selling.",

          "While staying at the hotel Rochat, I heard a choir singing, It was enjoyable to listen to a local choir sing.",
          "Third church we visited in Basel and its interior is very beautiful indeed. We had the church to ourselves and could enjoy its quietness and serenity. Here are marvellous wall murals worth a trip to Basel on their own. Don't miss the side chapel for a series of murals but also",
          "A beautiful church on top of the Medieval part of Basel, it has some original wall paintings from 12th/13th century which they uncovered and is just a nice building in gemeral. If you can go see a concert I would recommend it, I was lucky to enjoy a Barock one covering the music",
          "A surprise interior, with the most exquisite fresco fragments, well preserved. There were little explanation leaflets scattered around the church. We spent longer than we thought we would.",
          "This is a must see when in the area near the university. It is so pretty inside. Not fancy, but has a really nice feel. There is also a market in the platz on Saturday 7.30 am to 4 pm. This is more of a flea market with people selling used goods. I bought a beautiful vase for",
          "The Peterskirche interior has a flat ceiling with arched side stone pillars. There are old markers all along the wall. Make a point to walk behind the altar and see all of the old paintings that have began to fade as well as some of the old markers on the wall. The paintings",

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany. As of 2016, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018). The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007. Basel is the most densely populated city in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBasel has an area, as of 2009, of 23.91 square kilometers (9.23 sq mi). Of this area, 0.95 km2 (0.37 sq mi) or 4.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.88 km2 (0.34 sq mi) or 3.7% is forested.

Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.7% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 8.9%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 2.5% is used for growing crops and 1.3% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen system, Basel features a continental-influenced oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), due to its relatively far inland position. The city averages 120.4 days of rain or snow annually and on average receives 842 mm (33.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Basel receives an average of 99 mm (3.9 in) of rain. The month with the most days of precipitation is also May, with an average of 12.4 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 45 mm (1.8 in) of precipitation over 8.4 days.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThe city of Basel functions as the capital of the Swiss half-canton of Basel-Stadt, though several of its suburbs are located in the half-canton of Basel-Landschaft or the canton of Aargau.

They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority. The president (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election, while the heads of the other departments are appointed by the collegiate. The current president is Dr Guy Morin. The executive body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (German: Rathaus) on the central Marktplatz.

Unlike the members of the Executive Council, the members of the Grand Council are not politicians by profession, but they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020. The legislative body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (Rathaus).\nThe last election was held on 23 October 2016 for the mandate period (Legislatur) of 2017\u20132021.

The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%.

Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel.

Live marketing company and fair organizer MCH Group has its head office in Basel.\n\nThe carnival of the city of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (Morgestraich) on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\nBasel Tattoo, founded in 2006 by the local Top Secret Drum Corps, has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the Edinburgh Military Tattoo.

These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The football club FC Basel continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the 2008 European Championships, as well as Geneva, Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The championships were jointly hosted by Switzerland and Austria. BSC Old Boys and Concordia Basel are the other football teams in Basel.\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is ice hockey.

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany. As of 2016, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018). The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007. Basel is the most densely populated city in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBasel has an area, as of 2009, of 23.91 square kilometers (9.23 sq mi). Of this area, 0.95 km2 (0.37 sq mi) or 4.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.88 km2 (0.34 sq mi) or 3.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.67 km2 (7.98 sq mi) or 86.4% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.45 km2 (0.56 sq mi) or 6.1% is either rivers or lakes.Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 10.2% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 40.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 24.0%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.7% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 8.9%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 2.5% is used for growing crops and 1.3% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen system, Basel features a continental-influenced oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), due to its relatively far inland position. The city averages 120.4 days of rain or snow annually and on average receives 842 mm (33.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Basel receives an average of 99 mm (3.9 in) of rain. The month with the most days of precipitation is also May, with an average of 12.4 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 45 mm (1.8 in) of precipitation over 8.4 days.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThe city of Basel functions as the capital of the Swiss half-canton of Basel-Stadt, though several of its suburbs are located in the half-canton of Basel-Landschaft or the canton of Aargau. Others are even located in France and Germany.\n\n\n=== Canton ===\nThe canton Basel-Stadt consists of three municipalities: Riehen, Bettingen, and the city Basel itself. The political structure and agencies of the city and the canton are identical.\n\n\n=== City ===\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nThe city itself has 19 quarters:\n\nGrossbasel (Greater Basel):\nKleinbasel (Lesser Basel):\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is In Silber ein schwarzer Baselstab. (Argent, a staff of Basel sable)\n(For \"staff\", see Heraldsnet website.)\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe canton's executive, the Executive Council (Regierungsrat), consists of seven members for a mandate period of 4 years. They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority. The president (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election, while the heads of the other departments are appointed by the collegiate. The current president is Dr Guy Morin. The executive body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (German: Rathaus) on the central Marktplatz. The building was built in 1504\u201314.\nAs of 2016, Basel's Executive Council is made up of three representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party), and one member each of Green Alliance of Basel (GB) (who is the president), FDP (Free Democratic Party), LDP (Liberal-Demokratische Partei of Basel), and CVP (Christian Democratic Party), giving the left parties a combined four out of seven seats. The last election was held on 23 October and 27 November 2016.\n\nBarbara Sch\u00fcpbach-Guggenb\u00fchlis is State Chronicler (Staatsschreiberin) since 2009, and Marco Greiner is Head of Communication (Regierungssprecher) and Vice State Chronicler (Vizestaatsschreiber) since 2007 for the Executive Council.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe parliament, the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt (Grosser Rat), consists of 100 seats, with members (called in German: Grossrat/Grossr\u00e4tin) elected every 4 years. The sessions of the Grand Council are public. Unlike the members of the Executive Council, the members of the Grand Council are not politicians by profession, but they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020. The legislative body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (Rathaus).\nThe last election was held on 23 October 2016 for the mandate period (Legislatur) of 2017\u20132021. As of 1 February 2017, the Grand Council consist of 35 members of the Social Democratic Party (SP), 15 members of the Swiss People's Party (SVP), 13 Gr\u00fcnes B\u00fcndnis (GB) (a collaboration of the Green Party (GPS), its junior party, and Basels starke Alternative (BastA!)), 15 Liberal-Demokratische Partei (LDP) and its junior party, 10 The Liberals (FDP) and its junior party, the representative of the Aktive Bettingen (AB) is associated to the parliamentary group (Fraktion) of the FDP, 8 (7/1) Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP)/Evangelical People's Party (EVP), and 3 Green Liberal Party (GLP).The left parties missed an absolute majority by two seats.\n\n\n=== Federal elections ===\n\n\n==== National Council ====\nIn the 2019 federal election the most popular party was the Social Democratic Party (SP) which received two seats with 34% (\u22121) of the votes.

There were 70,517 married individuals, 12,435 widows or widowers and 13,104 individuals who are divorced.As of 2000 the average number of residents per living room was 0.59 which is about equal to the cantonal average of 0.58 per room. In this case, a room is defined as space of a housing unit of at least 4 m2 (43 sq ft) as normal bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens and habitable cellars and attics. About 10.5% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement).\nAs of 2000, there were 86,371 private households in the municipality, and an average of 1.8 persons per household.

The average apartment price in Basel was 100.2% of the national average of 1116 CHF. The vacancy rate for the municipality, in 2010, was 0.74%.\n\n\n==== Historical population ====\n\n\n=== Language ===\nMost of the population (as of 2000) speaks German (129,592 or 77.8%), with Italian being second most common (9,049 or 5.4%) and French being third (4,280 or 2.6%). There are 202 persons who speak Romansh.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nFrom the 2000 census, 41,916 or 25.2% were Roman Catholic, while 39,180 or 23.5% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. Of the rest of the population, there were 4,567 members of an Orthodox church (or about 2.74% of the population), there were 459 individuals (or about 0.28% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 3,464 individuals (or about 2.08% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church. There were 12,368 individuals (or about 7.43% of the population) who were Muslim. There were 1,325 individuals (or about 0.80% of the population) who were Jewish, however only members of religious institutions are counted as such by the municipality, which makes the actual number of people of Jewish descent living in Basel considerably higher. There were 746 individuals who were Buddhist, 947 individuals who were Hindu and 485 individuals who belonged to another church. 52,321 (or about 31.41% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 8,780 individuals (or about 5.27% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nBasel is subdivided into 19 quarters (Quartiere). The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%. As of 2008, there were 18 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 9 businesses involved in this sector. 34,645 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,176 businesses in this sector. 120,130 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 8,908 businesses in this sector. There were 82,449 residents of the municipality who were employed in some capacity, of which females made up 46.2% of the workforce.\nIn 2008 the total number of full-time equivalent jobs was 130,988. The number of jobs in the primary sector was 13, of which 10 were in agriculture and 4 were in forestry or lumber production. The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 33,171 of which 24,848 or (74.9%) were in manufacturing, 10 were in mining and 7,313 (22.0%) were in construction. The number of jobs in the tertiary sector was 97,804. In the tertiary sector; 12,880 or 13.2% were in wholesale or retail sales or the repair of motor vehicles, 11,959 or 12.2% were in the movement and storage of goods, 6,120 or 6.3% were in a hotel or restaurant, 4,186 or 4.3% were in the information industry, 10,752 or 11.0% were the insurance or financial industry, 13,695 or 14.0% were technical professionals or scientists, 6,983 or 7.1% were in education and 16,060 or 16.4% were in health care.In 2000, there were 121,842 workers who commuted into the municipality and 19,263 workers who commuted away.

About 23.9% of the workforce coming into Basel are coming from outside Switzerland, while 1.0% of the locals commute out of Switzerland for work. Of the working population, 49.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 18.7% used a private car.\n\nThe Roche Tower, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, is 41 floors and 178 metres (584 ft) high, upon its opening in 2015 it has become the tallest building in Switzerland. Basel has also Switzerland's third tallest building (Basler Messeturm, 105 m (344 ft)) and Switzerland's tallest tower (St. Chrischona TV tower, 250 m (820 ft)).\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nThe Swiss chemical industry operates largely from Basel, and Basel also has a large pharmaceutical industry. Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel.

The local TV station is called Telebasel. The German-speaking Swiss Radio and Television SRF company, part of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR, holds offices in Basel as well. The academic publishers Birkh\u00e4user, Karger and MDPI are based in Basel.\n\n\n=== Trade fairs ===\nImportant trade shows include Art Basel, the world's most important fair for modern and contemporary art, Baselworld (watches and jewelry), Swissbau (construction and real estate) and Igeho (hotels, catering, take-away, care). The Swiss Sample Fair (\"Schweizer Mustermesse\") was the largest and oldest consumer fair in Switzerland. It was held from 2007 to 2019 and took place in Kleinbasel on the right bank of the Rhine.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBesides Humanism the city of Basel has also always been very famous for its achievement in the field of mathematics. Among others, the mathematician Leonhard Euler and the Bernoulli family have done research and been teaching at the local institutions for centuries. In 1910 the Swiss Mathematical Society was founded in the city and in the mid-twentieth century the Russian mathematician Alexander Ostrowski taught at the local university. \nIn 2000 about 57,864 or (34.7%) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 27,603 or (16.6%) have completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule).

The University of Basel is currently counted among the 90 best educational institutions worldwide.In 2007, the ETH (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Z\u00fcrich) established the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) in Basel. The creation of the D-BSSE was driven by a Swiss-wide research initiative SystemsX, and was jointly supported by funding from the ETH Z\u00fcrich, the Swiss Government, the Swiss University Conference (SUC) and private industry.Basel also hosts several academies of the Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz|Fachhochschule NW (FHNW): the FHNW Academy of Art and Design, FHNW Academy of Music, and the FHNW School of Business.Basel is renowned for various scientific societies, such as the Entomological Society of Basel (Entomologische Gesellschaft Basel, EGB), which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2005.\n\n\n=== Volksschule ===\nIn 2005 16,939 pupils and students visited the Volksschule (the obligatory school time, including Kindergarten (127), primary schools (Primarschule, 25), and lower secondary schools (Sekundarschule, 10), of which 94% visited public schools and 39.5% were foreign nationals.

The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence in Europa.

Baselworld, the watch and jewellery show (Uhren- und Schmuckmesse) one of the biggest fairs of its kind in Europe is held every year as well, and attracts a great number of tourists and dealers to the city. Live marketing company and fair organizer MCH Group has its head office in Basel.\n\nThe carnival of the city of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (Morgestraich) on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\nBasel Tattoo, founded in 2006 by the local Top Secret Drum Corps, has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. The Basel Tattoo annual parade, with an estimated 125,000 visitors, is considered the largest event in Basel. The event is now sponsored by the Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS), making it the official military tattoo of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThere are a number of culinary specialties originating in Basel, including Basler L\u00e4ckerli cookies and M\u00e4ssmogge candies. Being located in the meeting place between Switzerland, France and Germany the culinary landscape as a whole is very varied and diverse, making it a city with a great number of restaurants of all sorts.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nZoo Basel is, with over 1.7 million visitors per year, the most visited tourist attraction in Basel and the second most visited tourist attraction in Switzerland.Established in 1874, Zoo Basel is the oldest zoo in Switzerland and, by number of animals, the largest. Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide Indian rhinoceros birth and Greater flamingo hatch in a zoo. These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The football club FC Basel continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the 2008 European Championships, as well as Geneva, Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The championships were jointly hosted by Switzerland and Austria. BSC Old Boys and Concordia Basel are the other football teams in Basel.\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is ice hockey. Basel is home to the EHC Basel which plays in the MySports League, the third tier of the Swiss ice hockey league system. They play their home games in the 6,700-seat St. Jakob Arena. The team previously played in the National League and the Swiss League, but they had to fill a bankruptcy case after the 2013\u201314 Swiss League season.\nBasel features a large football stadium that has been awarded four stars by UEFA, a modern ice hockey hall, and an admitted sports hall.\n\nA large indoor tennis event takes place in Basel every October. Some of the best ATP-professionals play every year at the Swiss Indoors, including Switzerland's biggest sporting hero and frequent participant Roger Federer, a Basel native who describes the city as \"one of the most beautiful cities in the world\".\nThe annual Basel Rhine Swim draws several thousand visitors to the city to swim in or float on the Rhine river.While football and ice hockey are by far the most popular sports, basketball has a very small but faithful fan base. The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

          "Open daily for lunch, some evenings (Thu-Sat?). Much busier at lunch. 20 or more choices. In the evening only about 1/2 of booths were open. Line up, order, carry to a table. No entry charge. Most booths only accept cash. Argentine plate was very good.",
          "I am a huge Markthalle fan. I love the concept with different food stands/cuisines from around the world. Everyone can just get what he or she wants and then sit together at the table.",
          "I think the fish and chips here would rival anything you could find in England. It is good value for money. He also makes great pies.... chicken, beef and vegetarian. All very good...",

          "I like the big choice of different kind of food all over the world and it's freshly made. The prices are quite cheap for a fresh made meal. It is a unique but simple place to meet and have lunch together, that's why I have my lunch once a week at Markthalle.",
          "I am living in Basel and I go frequently to the Alte Markthalle. Around 30 market stalls offer a wide range of food for lunch from most of the countries all over the world with a price starting from CHF 10. They have also started to offer food for dinner, at the weekend too",
          "It's a multi-cultural food court close to the Basel SBB station. Thai, Argentinian, Burgets, Hungarian .. you name it .. including coffee afterwords. You need to wander round, select your dish and then go find a table. It's the ultimate caf\u00e9 experience, but with food from all",
          "It's essentially a giant food-court where you get delicious meals from any of the stalls inside. Most of the food prepared uses good quality ingredients. Option for cafe, fruit shakes and various desserts. Also has a seating area with sofas and lamps with free wifi.",

Whilst the food choice is diverse, from",
          "It's surprising more people don't come here: it's a weak person's stone throw from the SBB (main train station), huge and unmissable, and quite often has a fire burning in a metal bin out by the main entrance. Once you go inside, there is a bizarrely eclectic mix of tastes on",
          "We were keen to see inside the intriguing market hall but were disappointed by the stalls, all of which seemed to be cooking unusual Oriental and African foods."

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany. As of 2016, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018). The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007. Basel is the most densely populated city in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBasel has an area, as of 2009, of 23.91 square kilometers (9.23 sq mi). Of this area, 0.95 km2 (0.37 sq mi) or 4.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.88 km2 (0.34 sq mi) or 3.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.67 km2 (7.98 sq mi) or 86.4% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.45 km2 (0.56 sq mi) or 6.1% is either rivers or lakes.Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 10.2% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 40.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 24.0%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.7% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 8.9%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 2.5% is used for growing crops and 1.3% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen system, Basel features a continental-influenced oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), due to its relatively far inland position. The city averages 120.4 days of rain or snow annually and on average receives 842 mm (33.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Basel receives an average of 99 mm (3.9 in) of rain. The month with the most days of precipitation is also May, with an average of 12.4 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 45 mm (1.8 in) of precipitation over 8.4 days.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThe city of Basel functions as the capital of the Swiss half-canton of Basel-Stadt, though several of its suburbs are located in the half-canton of Basel-Landschaft or the canton of Aargau. Others are even located in France and Germany.\n\n\n=== Canton ===\nThe canton Basel-Stadt consists of three municipalities: Riehen, Bettingen, and the city Basel itself. The political structure and agencies of the city and the canton are identical.\n\n\n=== City ===\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nThe city itself has 19 quarters:\n\nGrossbasel (Greater Basel):\nKleinbasel (Lesser Basel):\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is In Silber ein schwarzer Baselstab. (Argent, a staff of Basel sable)\n(For \"staff\", see Heraldsnet website.)\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe canton's executive, the Executive Council (Regierungsrat), consists of seven members for a mandate period of 4 years. They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority. The president (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election, while the heads of the other departments are appointed by the collegiate. The current president is Dr Guy Morin. The executive body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (German: Rathaus) on the central Marktplatz. The building was built in 1504\u201314.\nAs of 2016, Basel's Executive Council is made up of three representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party), and one member each of Green Alliance of Basel (GB) (who is the president), FDP (Free Democratic Party), LDP (Liberal-Demokratische Partei of Basel), and CVP (Christian Democratic Party), giving the left parties a combined four out of seven seats. The last election was held on 23 October and 27 November 2016.\n\nBarbara Sch\u00fcpbach-Guggenb\u00fchlis is State Chronicler (Staatsschreiberin) since 2009, and Marco Greiner is Head of Communication (Regierungssprecher) and Vice State Chronicler (Vizestaatsschreiber) since 2007 for the Executive Council.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe parliament, the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt (Grosser Rat), consists of 100 seats, with members (called in German: Grossrat/Grossr\u00e4tin) elected every 4 years. The sessions of the Grand Council are public. Unlike the members of the Executive Council, the members of the Grand Council are not politicians by profession, but they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020. The legislative body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (Rathaus).\nThe last election was held on 23 October 2016 for the mandate period (Legislatur) of 2017\u20132021.

The vacancy rate for the municipality, in 2010, was 0.74%.\n\n\n==== Historical population ====\n\n\n=== Language ===\nMost of the population (as of 2000) speaks German (129,592 or 77.8%), with Italian being second most common (9,049 or 5.4%) and French being third (4,280 or 2.6%). There are 202 persons who speak Romansh.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nFrom the 2000 census, 41,916 or 25.2% were Roman Catholic, while 39,180 or 23.5% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. Of the rest of the population, there were 4,567 members of an Orthodox church (or about 2.74% of the population), there were 459 individuals (or about 0.28% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 3,464 individuals (or about 2.08% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church. There were 12,368 individuals (or about 7.43% of the population) who were Muslim. There were 1,325 individuals (or about 0.80% of the population) who were Jewish, however only members of religious institutions are counted as such by the municipality, which makes the actual number of people of Jewish descent living in Basel considerably higher. There were 746 individuals who were Buddhist, 947 individuals who were Hindu and 485 individuals who belonged to another church. 52,321 (or about 31.41% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 8,780 individuals (or about 5.27% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nBasel is subdivided into 19 quarters (Quartiere). The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%. As of 2008, there were 18 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 9 businesses involved in this sector. 34,645 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,176 businesses in this sector. 120,130 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 8,908 businesses in this sector.

The number of jobs in the primary sector was 13, of which 10 were in agriculture and 4 were in forestry or lumber production. The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 33,171 of which 24,848 or (74.9%) were in manufacturing, 10 were in mining and 7,313 (22.0%) were in construction. The number of jobs in the tertiary sector was 97,804. In the tertiary sector; 12,880 or 13.2% were in wholesale or retail sales or the repair of motor vehicles, 11,959 or 12.2% were in the movement and storage of goods, 6,120 or 6.3% were in a hotel or restaurant, 4,186 or 4.3% were in the information industry, 10,752 or 11.0% were the insurance or financial industry, 13,695 or 14.0% were technical professionals or scientists, 6,983 or 7.1% were in education and 16,060 or 16.4% were in health care.In 2000, there were 121,842 workers who commuted into the municipality and 19,263 workers who commuted away.

About 23.9% of the workforce coming into Basel are coming from outside Switzerland, while 1.0% of the locals commute out of Switzerland for work. Of the working population, 49.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 18.7% used a private car.\n\nThe Roche Tower, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, is 41 floors and 178 metres (584 ft) high, upon its opening in 2015 it has become the tallest building in Switzerland. Basel has also Switzerland's third tallest building (Basler Messeturm, 105 m (344 ft)) and Switzerland's tallest tower (St. Chrischona TV tower, 250 m (820 ft)).\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nThe Swiss chemical industry operates largely from Basel, and Basel also has a large pharmaceutical industry. Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel.

The local TV station is called Telebasel. The German-speaking Swiss Radio and Television SRF company, part of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR, holds offices in Basel as well. The academic publishers Birkh\u00e4user, Karger and MDPI are based in Basel.\n\n\n=== Trade fairs ===\nImportant trade shows include Art Basel, the world's most important fair for modern and contemporary art, Baselworld (watches and jewelry), Swissbau (construction and real estate) and Igeho (hotels, catering, take-away, care). The Swiss Sample Fair (\"Schweizer Mustermesse\") was the largest and oldest consumer fair in Switzerland. It was held from 2007 to 2019 and took place in Kleinbasel on the right bank of the Rhine.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBesides Humanism the city of Basel has also always been very famous for its achievement in the field of mathematics. Among others, the mathematician Leonhard Euler and the Bernoulli family have done research and been teaching at the local institutions for centuries. In 1910 the Swiss Mathematical Society was founded in the city and in the mid-twentieth century the Russian mathematician Alexander Ostrowski taught at the local university. \nIn 2000 about 57,864 or (34.7%) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 27,603 or (16.6%) have completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule).

They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence in Europa. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.\n\nAntikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig Ancient cultures of the mediterranean museum\nAugusta Raurica Roman open-air museum\nBasel Paper Mill (German: Basler Papierm\u00fchle)\nBeyeler Foundation (Foundation Beyeler) Beyeler Museum (Fondation Beyeler)\nBotanical Garden Basel One of the oldest botanical gardens in the world\nCaricature & Cartoon Museum Basel (German: Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel)\nDollhouse Museum (German: Puppenhausmuseum) a museum housing the largest teddy bear collection in Europe.\nFoundation Fernet Branca (French: Fondation Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin near Basel.

The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (Morgestraich) on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\nBasel Tattoo, founded in 2006 by the local Top Secret Drum Corps, has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. The Basel Tattoo annual parade, with an estimated 125,000 visitors, is considered the largest event in Basel. The event is now sponsored by the Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS), making it the official military tattoo of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThere are a number of culinary specialties originating in Basel, including Basler L\u00e4ckerli cookies and M\u00e4ssmogge candies. Being located in the meeting place between Switzerland, France and Germany the culinary landscape as a whole is very varied and diverse, making it a city with a great number of restaurants of all sorts.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nZoo Basel is, with over 1.7 million visitors per year, the most visited tourist attraction in Basel and the second most visited tourist attraction in Switzerland.Established in 1874, Zoo Basel is the oldest zoo in Switzerland and, by number of animals, the largest. Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide Indian rhinoceros birth and Greater flamingo hatch in a zoo. These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The football club FC Basel continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the 2008 European Championships, as well as Geneva, Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The championships were jointly hosted by Switzerland and Austria. BSC Old Boys and Concordia Basel are the other football teams in Basel.\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is ice hockey. Basel is home to the EHC Basel which plays in the MySports League, the third tier of the Swiss ice hockey league system. They play their home games in the 6,700-seat St. Jakob Arena. The team previously played in the National League and the Swiss League, but they had to fill a bankruptcy case after the 2013\u201314 Swiss League season.\nBasel features a large football stadium that has been awarded four stars by UEFA, a modern ice hockey hall, and an admitted sports hall.\n\nA large indoor tennis event takes place in Basel every October. Some of the best ATP-professionals play every year at the Swiss Indoors, including Switzerland's biggest sporting hero and frequent participant Roger Federer, a Basel native who describes the city as \"one of the most beautiful cities in the world\".\nThe annual Basel Rhine Swim draws several thousand visitors to the city to swim in or float on the Rhine river.While football and ice hockey are by far the most popular sports, basketball has a very small but faithful fan base. The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

          "It is a very small museum about the life of Jewish. Because it is so small, it is not that easy to find. After a short walk, know a bit more on Jewish.",
          "Helpful staff and wonderful Audioguide with a video as part Of it featuring cute characters- I learned so Much about Jewish history In Switzerland- thank You so much!!",

          "I had read a couple of reviews before going to the museum and was a bit skeptical about going since the reviews weren't the best but I decided to give it a chance and I am so glad I did!! We thought we'd spend less than an hour at the museum since it sounded small but we ended",
          "Mot big enough to take up too much time in your day. I love seeing the Jewish sites and Basel has a really interesting history. Even the beautiful little courtyard is full of history and stories. We had a guide, which helped quite a bit in relaying all of the hidden stores.",

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany. As of 2016, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018). The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007. Basel is the most densely populated city in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBasel has an area, as of 2009, of 23.91 square kilometers (9.23 sq mi). Of this area, 0.95 km2 (0.37 sq mi) or 4.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.88 km2 (0.34 sq mi) or 3.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.67 km2 (7.98 sq mi) or 86.4% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.45 km2 (0.56 sq mi) or 6.1% is either rivers or lakes.Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 10.2% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 40.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 24.0%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.7% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 8.9%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 2.5% is used for growing crops and 1.3% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen system, Basel features a continental-influenced oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), due to its relatively far inland position. The city averages 120.4 days of rain or snow annually and on average receives 842 mm (33.1 in) of precipitation.

About 10.5% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement).\nAs of 2000, there were 86,371 private households in the municipality, and an average of 1.8 persons per household. There were 44,469 households that consist of only one person and 2,842 households with five or more people.

There are 202 persons who speak Romansh.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nFrom the 2000 census, 41,916 or 25.2% were Roman Catholic, while 39,180 or 23.5% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. Of the rest of the population, there were 4,567 members of an Orthodox church (or about 2.74% of the population), there were 459 individuals (or about 0.28% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 3,464 individuals (or about 2.08% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church.

There were 1,325 individuals (or about 0.80% of the population) who were Jewish, however only members of religious institutions are counted as such by the municipality, which makes the actual number of people of Jewish descent living in Basel considerably higher. There were 746 individuals who were Buddhist, 947 individuals who were Hindu and 485 individuals who belonged to another church. 52,321 (or about 31.41% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 8,780 individuals (or about 5.27% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nBasel is subdivided into 19 quarters (Quartiere). The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%. As of 2008, there were 18 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 9 businesses involved in this sector. 34,645 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,176 businesses in this sector. 120,130 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 8,908 businesses in this sector.

Of the working population, 49.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 18.7% used a private car.\n\nThe Roche Tower, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, is 41 floors and 178 metres (584 ft) high, upon its opening in 2015 it has become the tallest building in Switzerland. Basel has also Switzerland's third tallest building (Basler Messeturm, 105 m (344 ft)) and Switzerland's tallest tower (St. Chrischona TV tower, 250 m (820 ft)).\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nThe Swiss chemical industry operates largely from Basel, and Basel also has a large pharmaceutical industry. Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel.

It was held from 2007 to 2019 and took place in Kleinbasel on the right bank of the Rhine.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBesides Humanism the city of Basel has also always been very famous for its achievement in the field of mathematics. Among others, the mathematician Leonhard Euler and the Bernoulli family have done research and been teaching at the local institutions for centuries. In 1910 the Swiss Mathematical Society was founded in the city and in the mid-twentieth century the Russian mathematician Alexander Ostrowski taught at the local university. \nIn 2000 about 57,864 or (34.7%) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 27,603 or (16.6%) have completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule).

They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence in Europa. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.\n\nAntikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig Ancient cultures of the mediterranean museum\nAugusta Raurica Roman open-air museum\nBasel Paper Mill (German: Basler Papierm\u00fchle)\nBeyeler Foundation (Foundation Beyeler) Beyeler Museum (Fondation Beyeler)\nBotanical Garden Basel One of the oldest botanical gardens in the world\nCaricature & Cartoon Museum Basel (German: Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel)\nDollhouse Museum (German: Puppenhausmuseum) a museum housing the largest teddy bear collection in Europe.\nFoundation Fernet Branca (French: Fondation Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin near Basel.

Live marketing company and fair organizer MCH Group has its head office in Basel.\n\nThe carnival of the city of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (Morgestraich) on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\nBasel Tattoo, founded in 2006 by the local Top Secret Drum Corps, has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the Edinburgh Military Tattoo.

Being located in the meeting place between Switzerland, France and Germany the culinary landscape as a whole is very varied and diverse, making it a city with a great number of restaurants of all sorts.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nZoo Basel is, with over 1.7 million visitors per year, the most visited tourist attraction in Basel and the second most visited tourist attraction in Switzerland.Established in 1874, Zoo Basel is the oldest zoo in Switzerland and, by number of animals, the largest. Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide Indian rhinoceros birth and Greater flamingo hatch in a zoo. These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The football club FC Basel continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the 2008 European Championships, as well as Geneva, Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The championships were jointly hosted by Switzerland and Austria. BSC Old Boys and Concordia Basel are the other football teams in Basel.\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is ice hockey. Basel is home to the EHC Basel which plays in the MySports League, the third tier of the Swiss ice hockey league system. They play their home games in the 6,700-seat St. Jakob Arena. The team previously played in the National League and the Swiss League, but they had to fill a bankruptcy case after the 2013\u201314 Swiss League season.\nBasel features a large football stadium that has been awarded four stars by UEFA, a modern ice hockey hall, and an admitted sports hall.\n\nA large indoor tennis event takes place in Basel every October. Some of the best ATP-professionals play every year at the Swiss Indoors, including Switzerland's biggest sporting hero and frequent participant Roger Federer, a Basel native who describes the city as \"one of the most beautiful cities in the world\".\nThe annual Basel Rhine Swim draws several thousand visitors to the city to swim in or float on the Rhine river.While football and ice hockey are by far the most popular sports, basketball has a very small but faithful fan base. The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

          "This is a tri-country point wherein you are in Germany, Swiss and France at the same time in Basel, Swiss! Close by to this is Cafe wherein you can have coffee and quick snacks at St. Louis as town in France. And indeed a good photo point as well!",
          "An interesting atraction to visit, is located in the middle of the river Rhine. The monument is in Swiss territory and marks the tripoint where the borders of France, Germany and Switzerland meet. The France\u2013Germany border, the Germany\u2013Switzerland border and France\u2013Switzerland",
          "I wouldn't go out of my way to see this, but I would stop if nearby (and I did!). We were on the bus tour of Basel, and they stopped here for a few minutes. Got a few pictures of being in 3 countries at once, and that was it.",
          "Worth seeing if you are passing for some other reason (in our case a river cruise) but rather underwhelming. From the river it would easily be missed if not pointed out to you.",
          "We embarked our riverboat in this area so we walked to the monument after dusk from our ship. Interesting that these countries that have so often been at odds put up this colorful & impressive monument.",
          "Border triangle of Switzerland, France and Germany. A fun place to visit if you are in the area. If you are following the path along the river, stay along the river and do not climb up steps to restaurant.",
          "I decided to travel to this place on foot from the nearest tram station and it turned out to be a long way off. I had to walk a good 30 minutes to reach the monument. You will need to ask directions if you want to reach here on your own. The place was empty - no tourists, no",
          "My Honey Bee & me were in Basel and went up to this monument of friendship among three countries. Of course, they actually touch corners in the Rhine. Nonetheless it is a tribute to the times when people can get along with each other. An unanticipated bonus was the Beach Bar",
          "This is stated to be a Symbol Of Friendship between three Neibhour\u2019s ( Germany, France and Switzerland) And they chose River Rhine in Basel for their symbol/tower of friendship. The cemented banks of the River is long and good for walking.",
          "This place is down in the port of Basel but only a short walk from the nearest tram stop. It has nice seating areas and is situated just beside the point where the Swiss, German and French borders meet. There is also food available.",
          "there is really nothing to see here except for the awareness that 3 countries meet somewhere in the middle of the river. We visited on a bus tour of the city, but no point in making a special journey.",
          "A nice place on the Rhine at the intersection of three wonderful countries. Interestingly, as you change your eyes easily, you are already in another country. This monument is easily reached, the monument is located on the German side in Weil am Rhein, 8 km from Basel Airport.",
          "It\u2019s not must see but definitely if you\u2019re in Basel it\u2019s worth to visit. I was there in March so not many tourist",

          "The three country border point (or Dreilaendereck) is nice to go to if you have extra time just to say you\u2019ve been at the border of the 3 countries - France, Germany & Switzerland. Nice photo opportunity. I wanted to complain about their being no bar in the area cause I thought",
          "It was pretty cool to be able to stand in three countries at once and there is a bar located at the point so you can also grab a coffee or something else to drink. People have also ruined the tower with graffiti so you may need to adjust any photos that you take.",

          "This is a very neat spot showing the boundary of Switzerland, France and Germany. The problem is that it is difficult to get to and it isn't well marked. You either walk along a small path or through the recycling area. Also, it isn't much of a tourist draw, but it is",
          "Very beautiful and serene place to spend some time on a lazy afternoon. Sitting ideally for long and watching activities happening on the other side of the border is fascinating, especially for people of Asian (Indian) origin. For us, borders are always fascinating to watch for",

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany. As of 2016, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018). The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007. Basel is the most densely populated city in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBasel has an area, as of 2009, of 23.91 square kilometers (9.23 sq mi). Of this area, 0.95 km2 (0.37 sq mi) or 4.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.88 km2 (0.34 sq mi) or 3.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.67 km2 (7.98 sq mi) or 86.4% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.45 km2 (0.56 sq mi) or 6.1% is either rivers or lakes.Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 10.2% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 40.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 24.0%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.7% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 8.9%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 2.5% is used for growing crops and 1.3% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen system, Basel features a continental-influenced oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), due to its relatively far inland position. The city averages 120.4 days of rain or snow annually and on average receives 842 mm (33.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Basel receives an average of 99 mm (3.9 in) of rain. The month with the most days of precipitation is also May, with an average of 12.4 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 45 mm (1.8 in) of precipitation over 8.4 days.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThe city of Basel functions as the capital of the Swiss half-canton of Basel-Stadt, though several of its suburbs are located in the half-canton of Basel-Landschaft or the canton of Aargau. Others are even located in France and Germany.\n\n\n=== Canton ===\nThe canton Basel-Stadt consists of three municipalities: Riehen, Bettingen, and the city Basel itself. The political structure and agencies of the city and the canton are identical.\n\n\n=== City ===\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nThe city itself has 19 quarters:\n\nGrossbasel (Greater Basel):\nKleinbasel (Lesser Basel):\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is In Silber ein schwarzer Baselstab. (Argent, a staff of Basel sable)\n(For \"staff\", see Heraldsnet website.)\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe canton's executive, the Executive Council (Regierungsrat), consists of seven members for a mandate period of 4 years. They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority. The president (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election, while the heads of the other departments are appointed by the collegiate. The current president is Dr Guy Morin. The executive body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (German: Rathaus) on the central Marktplatz. The building was built in 1504\u201314.\nAs of 2016, Basel's Executive Council is made up of three representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party), and one member each of Green Alliance of Basel (GB) (who is the president), FDP (Free Democratic Party), LDP (Liberal-Demokratische Partei of Basel), and CVP (Christian Democratic Party), giving the left parties a combined four out of seven seats. The last election was held on 23 October and 27 November 2016.\n\nBarbara Sch\u00fcpbach-Guggenb\u00fchlis is State Chronicler (Staatsschreiberin) since 2009, and Marco Greiner is Head of Communication (Regierungssprecher) and Vice State Chronicler (Vizestaatsschreiber) since 2007 for the Executive Council.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe parliament, the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt (Grosser Rat), consists of 100 seats, with members (called in German: Grossrat/Grossr\u00e4tin) elected every 4 years. The sessions of the Grand Council are public. Unlike the members of the Executive Council, the members of the Grand Council are not politicians by profession, but they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020. The legislative body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (Rathaus).\nThe last election was held on 23 October 2016 for the mandate period (Legislatur) of 2017\u20132021.

The average rate for a one-room apartment was 602.27 CHF (US$480, \u00a3270, \u20ac390), a two-room apartment was about 846.52 CHF (US$680, \u00a3380, \u20ac540), a three-room apartment was about 1054.14 CHF (US$840, \u00a3470, \u20ac670) and a six or more room apartment cost an average of 2185.24 CHF (US$1750, \u00a3980, \u20ac1400).  The average apartment price in Basel was 100.2% of the national average of 1116 CHF. The vacancy rate for the municipality, in 2010, was 0.74%.\n\n\n==== Historical population ====\n\n\n=== Language ===\nMost of the population (as of 2000) speaks German (129,592 or 77.8%), with Italian being second most common (9,049 or 5.4%) and French being third (4,280 or 2.6%). There are 202 persons who speak Romansh.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nFrom the 2000 census, 41,916 or 25.2% were Roman Catholic, while 39,180 or 23.5% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. Of the rest of the population, there were 4,567 members of an Orthodox church (or about 2.74% of the population), there were 459 individuals (or about 0.28% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 3,464 individuals (or about 2.08% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church. There were 12,368 individuals (or about 7.43% of the population) who were Muslim. There were 1,325 individuals (or about 0.80% of the population) who were Jewish, however only members of religious institutions are counted as such by the municipality, which makes the actual number of people of Jewish descent living in Basel considerably higher. There were 746 individuals who were Buddhist, 947 individuals who were Hindu and 485 individuals who belonged to another church. 52,321 (or about 31.41% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 8,780 individuals (or about 5.27% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nBasel is subdivided into 19 quarters (Quartiere). The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%. As of 2008, there were 18 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 9 businesses involved in this sector. 34,645 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,176 businesses in this sector. 120,130 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 8,908 businesses in this sector.

The number of jobs in the primary sector was 13, of which 10 were in agriculture and 4 were in forestry or lumber production. The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 33,171 of which 24,848 or (74.9%) were in manufacturing, 10 were in mining and 7,313 (22.0%) were in construction. The number of jobs in the tertiary sector was 97,804. In the tertiary sector; 12,880 or 13.2% were in wholesale or retail sales or the repair of motor vehicles, 11,959 or 12.2% were in the movement and storage of goods, 6,120 or 6.3% were in a hotel or restaurant, 4,186 or 4.3% were in the information industry, 10,752 or 11.0% were the insurance or financial industry, 13,695 or 14.0% were technical professionals or scientists, 6,983 or 7.1% were in education and 16,060 or 16.4% were in health care.In 2000, there were 121,842 workers who commuted into the municipality and 19,263 workers who commuted away.

About 23.9% of the workforce coming into Basel are coming from outside Switzerland, while 1.0% of the locals commute out of Switzerland for work. Of the working population, 49.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 18.7% used a private car.\n\nThe Roche Tower, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, is 41 floors and 178 metres (584 ft) high, upon its opening in 2015 it has become the tallest building in Switzerland. Basel has also Switzerland's third tallest building (Basler Messeturm, 105 m (344 ft)) and Switzerland's tallest tower (St. Chrischona TV tower, 250 m (820 ft)).\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nThe Swiss chemical industry operates largely from Basel, and Basel also has a large pharmaceutical industry. Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel.

The local TV station is called Telebasel. The German-speaking Swiss Radio and Television SRF company, part of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR, holds offices in Basel as well. The academic publishers Birkh\u00e4user, Karger and MDPI are based in Basel.\n\n\n=== Trade fairs ===\nImportant trade shows include Art Basel, the world's most important fair for modern and contemporary art, Baselworld (watches and jewelry), Swissbau (construction and real estate) and Igeho (hotels, catering, take-away, care). The Swiss Sample Fair (\"Schweizer Mustermesse\") was the largest and oldest consumer fair in Switzerland. It was held from 2007 to 2019 and took place in Kleinbasel on the right bank of the Rhine.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBesides Humanism the city of Basel has also always been very famous for its achievement in the field of mathematics. Among others, the mathematician Leonhard Euler and the Bernoulli family have done research and been teaching at the local institutions for centuries. In 1910 the Swiss Mathematical Society was founded in the city and in the mid-twentieth century the Russian mathematician Alexander Ostrowski taught at the local university. \nIn 2000 about 57,864 or (34.7%) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 27,603 or (16.6%) have completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule).

Live marketing company and fair organizer MCH Group has its head office in Basel.\n\nThe carnival of the city of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (Morgestraich) on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\nBasel Tattoo, founded in 2006 by the local Top Secret Drum Corps, has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. The Basel Tattoo annual parade, with an estimated 125,000 visitors, is considered the largest event in Basel. The event is now sponsored by the Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS), making it the official military tattoo of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThere are a number of culinary specialties originating in Basel, including Basler L\u00e4ckerli cookies and M\u00e4ssmogge candies. Being located in the meeting place between Switzerland, France and Germany the culinary landscape as a whole is very varied and diverse, making it a city with a great number of restaurants of all sorts.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nZoo Basel is, with over 1.7 million visitors per year, the most visited tourist attraction in Basel and the second most visited tourist attraction in Switzerland.Established in 1874, Zoo Basel is the oldest zoo in Switzerland and, by number of animals, the largest. Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide Indian rhinoceros birth and Greater flamingo hatch in a zoo. These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The football club FC Basel continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the 2008 European Championships, as well as Geneva, Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The championships were jointly hosted by Switzerland and Austria. BSC Old Boys and Concordia Basel are the other football teams in Basel.\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is ice hockey. Basel is home to the EHC Basel which plays in the MySports League, the third tier of the Swiss ice hockey league system. They play their home games in the 6,700-seat St. Jakob Arena. The team previously played in the National League and the Swiss League, but they had to fill a bankruptcy case after the 2013\u201314 Swiss League season.\nBasel features a large football stadium that has been awarded four stars by UEFA, a modern ice hockey hall, and an admitted sports hall.\n\nA large indoor tennis event takes place in Basel every October. Some of the best ATP-professionals play every year at the Swiss Indoors, including Switzerland's biggest sporting hero and frequent participant Roger Federer, a Basel native who describes the city as \"one of the most beautiful cities in the world\".\nThe annual Basel Rhine Swim draws several thousand visitors to the city to swim in or float on the Rhine river.While football and ice hockey are by far the most popular sports, basketball has a very small but faithful fan base. The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany. As of 2016, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018). The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007. Basel is the most densely populated city in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBasel has an area, as of 2009, of 23.91 square kilometers (9.23 sq mi). Of this area, 0.95 km2 (0.37 sq mi) or 4.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.88 km2 (0.34 sq mi) or 3.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.67 km2 (7.98 sq mi) or 86.4% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.45 km2 (0.56 sq mi) or 6.1% is either rivers or lakes.Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 10.2% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 40.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 24.0%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.7% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 8.9%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 2.5% is used for growing crops and 1.3% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen system, Basel features a continental-influenced oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), due to its relatively far inland position. The city averages 120.4 days of rain or snow annually and on average receives 842 mm (33.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Basel receives an average of 99 mm (3.9 in) of rain. The month with the most days of precipitation is also May, with an average of 12.4 days. The driest month of the year is February with an average of 45 mm (1.8 in) of precipitation over 8.4 days.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThe city of Basel functions as the capital of the Swiss half-canton of Basel-Stadt, though several of its suburbs are located in the half-canton of Basel-Landschaft or the canton of Aargau. Others are even located in France and Germany.\n\n\n=== Canton ===\nThe canton Basel-Stadt consists of three municipalities: Riehen, Bettingen, and the city Basel itself. The political structure and agencies of the city and the canton are identical.\n\n\n=== City ===\n\n\n==== Quarters ====\nThe city itself has 19 quarters:\n\nGrossbasel (Greater Basel):\nKleinbasel (Lesser Basel):\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is In Silber ein schwarzer Baselstab. (Argent, a staff of Basel sable)\n(For \"staff\", see Heraldsnet website.)\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe canton's executive, the Executive Council (Regierungsrat), consists of seven members for a mandate period of 4 years. They are elected by any inhabitant valid to vote on the same day as the parliament, but by means of a system of Majorz, and operates as a collegiate authority. The president (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sident(in)) is elected as such by a public election, while the heads of the other departments are appointed by the collegiate. The current president is Dr Guy Morin. The executive body holds its meetings in the red Town Hall (German: Rathaus) on the central Marktplatz. The building was built in 1504\u201314.\nAs of 2016, Basel's Executive Council is made up of three representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party), and one member each of Green Alliance of Basel (GB) (who is the president), FDP (Free Democratic Party), LDP (Liberal-Demokratische Partei of Basel), and CVP (Christian Democratic Party), giving the left parties a combined four out of seven seats. The last election was held on 23 October and 27 November 2016.\n\nBarbara Sch\u00fcpbach-Guggenb\u00fchlis is State Chronicler (Staatsschreiberin) since 2009, and Marco Greiner is Head of Communication (Regierungssprecher) and Vice State Chronicler (Vizestaatsschreiber) since 2007 for the Executive Council.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe parliament, the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt (Grosser Rat), consists of 100 seats, with members (called in German: Grossrat/Grossr\u00e4tin) elected every 4 years. The sessions of the Grand Council are public. Unlike the members of the Executive Council, the members of the Grand Council are not politicians by profession, but they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Basel allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the parliament. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Proporz, and political parties must have surpassed an election quorum of 4% per election district to enter the council, but this will end with the next election in 2020.

About 10.5% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement).\nAs of 2000, there were 86,371 private households in the municipality, and an average of 1.8 persons per household. There were 44,469 households that consist of only one person and 2,842 households with five or more people.

There were 1,325 individuals (or about 0.80% of the population) who were Jewish, however only members of religious institutions are counted as such by the municipality, which makes the actual number of people of Jewish descent living in Basel considerably higher. There were 746 individuals who were Buddhist, 947 individuals who were Hindu and 485 individuals who belonged to another church. 52,321 (or about 31.41% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 8,780 individuals (or about 5.27% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nBasel is subdivided into 19 quarters (Quartiere). The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%.

Basel has also Switzerland's third tallest building (Basler Messeturm, 105 m (344 ft)) and Switzerland's tallest tower (St. Chrischona TV tower, 250 m (820 ft)).\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nThe Swiss chemical industry operates largely from Basel, and Basel also has a large pharmaceutical industry. Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel.

Theater Basel, chosen in 1999 as the best stage for German-language performances and in 2009 and 2010 as \"Opera house of the year\" by German opera magazine Opernwelt, presents a busy schedule of plays in addition to being home to the city's opera and ballet companies. Basel is home to the largest orchestra in Switzerland, the Sinfonieorchester Basel. It is also the home of the Basel Sinfonietta and the Kammerorchester Basel, which recorded the complete symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven for the Sony label, led by its music director Giovanni Antonini. The Schola Cantorum and the Basler Kammerorchester were both founded by the conductor Paul Sacher, who went on to commission works by many leading composers. The Paul Sacher Foundation, opened in 1986, houses a major collection of manuscripts, including the entire Igor Stravinsky archive.\nThe baroque orchestras La Cetra and Capriccio Basel are also based in Basel.\nIn May 2004, the fifth European Festival of Youth Choirs (Europ\u00e4isches Jugendchorfestival, or EJCF) opened; this Basel tradition started in 1992. Host of the festival is the local Basel Boys Choir.\nIn 1997, Basel contended to become the \"European Capital of Culture\", though the honor went to Thessaloniki.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Basel museums cover a broad and diverse spectrum of collections with a marked concentration in the fine arts. They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence in Europa. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.\n\nAntikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig Ancient cultures of the mediterranean museum\nAugusta Raurica Roman open-air museum\nBasel Paper Mill (German: Basler Papierm\u00fchle)\nBeyeler Foundation (Foundation Beyeler) Beyeler Museum (Fondation Beyeler)\nBotanical Garden Basel One of the oldest botanical gardens in the world\nCaricature & Cartoon Museum Basel (German: Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel)\nDollhouse Museum (German: Puppenhausmuseum) a museum housing the largest teddy bear collection in Europe.\nFoundation Fernet Branca (French: Fondation Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin near Basel.

One of the most important fairs for contemporary art worldwide is the Art Basel which was founded in 1970 by Ernst Beyeler and takes place in June each year. Baselworld, the watch and jewellery show (Uhren- und Schmuckmesse) one of the biggest fairs of its kind in Europe is held every year as well, and attracts a great number of tourists and dealers to the city. Live marketing company and fair organizer MCH Group has its head office in Basel.\n\nThe carnival of the city of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (Morgestraich) on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\nBasel Tattoo, founded in 2006 by the local Top Secret Drum Corps, has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. The Basel Tattoo annual parade, with an estimated 125,000 visitors, is considered the largest event in Basel. The event is now sponsored by the Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS), making it the official military tattoo of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThere are a number of culinary specialties originating in Basel, including Basler L\u00e4ckerli cookies and M\u00e4ssmogge candies. Being located in the meeting place between Switzerland, France and Germany the culinary landscape as a whole is very varied and diverse, making it a city with a great number of restaurants of all sorts.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nZoo Basel is, with over 1.7 million visitors per year, the most visited tourist attraction in Basel and the second most visited tourist attraction in Switzerland.Established in 1874, Zoo Basel is the oldest zoo in Switzerland and, by number of animals, the largest. Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide Indian rhinoceros birth and Greater flamingo hatch in a zoo. These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The football club FC Basel continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the 2008 European Championships, as well as Geneva, Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The championships were jointly hosted by Switzerland and Austria. BSC Old Boys and Concordia Basel are the other football teams in Basel.\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is ice hockey. Basel is home to the EHC Basel which plays in the MySports League, the third tier of the Swiss ice hockey league system. They play their home games in the 6,700-seat St. Jakob Arena. The team previously played in the National League and the Swiss League, but they had to fill a bankruptcy case after the 2013\u201314 Swiss League season.\nBasel features a large football stadium that has been awarded four stars by UEFA, a modern ice hockey hall, and an admitted sports hall.\n\nA large indoor tennis event takes place in Basel every October. Some of the best ATP-professionals play every year at the Swiss Indoors, including Switzerland's biggest sporting hero and frequent participant Roger Federer, a Basel native who describes the city as \"one of the most beautiful cities in the world\".\nThe annual Basel Rhine Swim draws several thousand visitors to the city to swim in or float on the Rhine river.While football and ice hockey are by far the most popular sports, basketball has a very small but faithful fan base. The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

        "wiki": "Nightfever is a night of prayer and part of the Nightfever initiative which is rooted in the Catholic Church. The goal is to help those far away from the Church to encounter God and to experience His love and mercy.\nNightfever events take place in over 80 cities in Europe, North and South America, and Australia., and is especially centered in Germany where it began after the 20th World Youth Day in Cologne. To celebrate Nightfever one must be trained by the Nightfever international team to receive permission.\n\n\n== History ==\nNightfever was founded by students Katharina Fassler-Maloney, a member of the Emmanuel Community, and Andreas S\u00fc\u00df, then a seminarian and today a priest. After World Youth Day 2005 in Cologne the pair thought, \"This cannot be the end. This great vibe/spirit of the WYD has to go on in our daily lives\u2026!\" Only one event was originally planned, but due to its success it was continued, and then spread across Germany, Europe, and beyond. The first Nightfever in North America was held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 2012.On Saturday nights volunteers stand on streets near bars, theaters, and parties in city centers. They approach strangers and say things such as \"Hey, want a candle? We\u2019re praying for peace.\" If the passerby agrees they are welcomed into the church, or the volunteer walks them to nearby church where the event is taking place. Participants are welcome to light their candle and leave, or to stay and pray for as short or as long of a time as they like. When they leave, \"their candles burn on as a symbol of their concerns and thoughts.\"In addition to lighting candles at the altar, common elements inside the church include the Eucharistic exposed for adoration, contemporary Christian music, submitting prayer intentions, and priests on hand to administer the Sacrament of Reconciliation or to provide prayer, support, and counsel. Nightfever typically goes late into the night.As they leave, participants are often given items to take with them. In New York, it is small cards thanking them for coming and quoting Jeremiah 29:11: \u201cFor I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for your welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.\u201d In Dublin attendees also left with a verse from the Bible to reflect upon, and in Chicago they were given hot chocolate.An organizer in Britain describes Nightfever as \"a door opener. For those who once had faith in God we hope they will be renewed through their experience at St Patrick's. For those who have never met Christ we hope this becomes a moment of fruitful encounter.\" Events often see hundreds and even thousands of people attend.\n\n\n== Venues ==\nNightfever takes place in city center Catholic churches.\n\nGreat Britain\nLondon, St Patrick's Church, Soho Square\nOxford, Blackfriars\nGosport, St Mary's RC Church\nManchester, Holy Name Church\nLiverpool, Blessed Sacrament Shrine\nSheffield, St Marie's Cathedral\nLeeds, St Anne's Cathedral\nScotland\nGlasgow, St Aloysius Church\nEdinburgh, Edinburgh University catholic Society\nDundee, St Andrew's Cathedral\nBelgium\nBrussels, St croix Church\nLiege, St Jean Church\nLeuven, St Antonius Chapel\nCanada\nHalifax, St. Mary's Basilica\nHamilton, Canadian Martyrs Catholic Church\nKingston, St. Mary's Cathedral\nGermany:\nAachen, St. Foillan\nAugsburg, Dom Unserer Lieben Frau\nBerlin, St. Bonifatius\nBonn, St. Remigius\nD\u00fcsseldorf, St. Lambertus\nDuisburg, Liebfrauenkirche\nErfurt, Lorenzkirche\nFrankfurt, Frankfurter Dom\nFreiburg, St. Martin\nFulda, Heilig-Geist-Kirche\nF\u00fcssen,Krippkirche St. Nikolaus\nGummersbach, St. Franziskus\nHeidelberg, St. Anna\nH\u00f6hr-Grenzhausen, St. Peter und Paul\nJena, St. Johannes Baptist\nK\u00f6ln, K\u00f6lner Dom\nMainz, Augustinerkirche\nM\u00fcnchen, St. Peter\nM\u00fcnster, St. Lamberti\nN\u00fcrnberg, St. Elisabeth\nPaderborn, Marktkirche\nRegensburg, St. Johann\nSaarbr\u00fccken, Basilika St. Johann\nTrier, St. Gangolf\nW\u00fcrzburg, Karmelitenkloster W\u00fcrzburg Maria Magdalena\nWuppertal, St. Laurentius\nAustria\nGraz, Franziskanerkloster\nWien, Wiener Minoritenkirche\nSwitzerland:\nBasel, Clarakirche\nDenmark\nCopenhagen, St. Ansgars\nNetherlands\nOldenzaal, St. Plechelmus-Basilika\nThe United States of America\nHoly Name Cathedral, Chicago\nSt. Louis Cathedral, New Orleans, LA\nMexico\nQuer\u00e9taro, San Jose de Gracia\nCiudad de M\u00e9xico\nHungary\nSt. Michael, Downtown\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Nightfever website \u2013 official Nightfever website\nNightfever-London \u2013 Nightfever London website\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Augusta Raurica is a Roman archaeological site and an open-air museum in Switzerland located on the south bank of the Rhine river about 20 km east of Basel near the villages of Augst and Kaiseraugst.  It is the site of the oldest known Roman colony on the Rhine.\n\n\n== Founding ==\n\nAugusta Raurica, or Colonia Augusta Rauracorum, was founded by Lucius Munatius Plancus around 44 BC in the vicinity of a local Gallic tribe, the Rauraci, relatives of the Helvetii.  No archaeological evidence from this period has yet been found, leading to the conclusion that, either the settlement of the colony was disturbed by the civil war following the death of Julius Caesar, or that Plancus' colony was actually in the area of modern Basel, not Augst.\nSuccessful colonization of the site had to wait for Augustus' conquest of the central Alps around 15 BC. The oldest find to date at Augusta Raurica has been dated to 6 BC by dendrochronology.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe inscription on Munatius Plancus' grave merely states the name of the colony as Colonia Raurica.  A fragmentary inscription from the Augustinian period speaks of the Colonia P[aterna] (?) M[unatia] (?) [Felix] (?) [Apolli]naris [Augusta E]merita [Raur]ica (letters in brackets are reconstructions).  Apart from this fragmentary reference, the first certain witness to the use of the name Augustus comes from the geographer Ptolemy in the Ancient Greek form Aug\u00fasta Raur\u00edkon (lat. Augusta Rauricorum).\nAugusta Raurica played an important role in Augustus' plans of conquest with two other colonies that bear his name: Augusta Praetoria (modern Aosta at the southern end of the Great Saint Bernard Pass) and Augusta Vindelicum (modern Augsburg, an outpost on the Danube).  These three Augustae form the corners of a triangle that reaches across the alpine conquests of Augustus, the long base of which form the Rhine knee to the Danube formed the frontier against unconquered Germania.\n\n\n== Layout of the settlement ==\n\nDuring excavations it was determined that the city was founded on a high plateau just south of the Rhine river.  Two small rivers, the Ergolz and Violen, have carved a triangle in the plateau, the base of which is about 1 kilometer wide along the base of the Jura Mountains, and the apex points northward toward the Rhine, about 1 kilometer from the base.  This point is the site of the Roman castrum, or military fortification.  The city is, therefore, well-defended by steep slopes to the north, east, and west.\n\nThe next step in planning the city was the surveying of the area according to the architect's plans for the city.  Every important public building had its specific place, starting with the temple of Jupiter as the sacred high point from which the street network would spread.  The architect, who was responsible for executing the plans for the city, next laid a longitudinal axis across the triangle 36\u02da west of north to form the main street of the settlement.  Other longitudinal streets were laid out parallel to the main street at intervals of 55 meters.  The main street was then divided into sections of 66 meters (255 Roman feet), which formed the corners of 10 crossing streets.  This created a series of rectangular blocks of around 50 by 60 meters. The streets were laid on a solid bed of gravel and flanked by gutters on both sides.  The more important roads featured covered sidewalks behind rows of columns.\n\n\n== Borders ==\n\nThe limits of Colonia Raurica can no longer be determined with absolute accuracy.  However the approximate boundaries can be determined by examining the extent of Augst in the Early Middle Ages.  This would seem to indicate the colony extended from Basel toward the mouth of the Aare, then up the Aare to the mouth of the Sigger below Solothurn, across to the L\u00fcssel, and then back down the Birs to Basel, though this is still conjecture.  New research, based on tiles stamped with the mark of the Vindonissa Legion, indicates some administrative dependence on Vindonissa.  This would indicate that the colony reached over the B\u00f6zberg toward Frick, with the Thiersteinberg below Frick forming the eastern boundary.  The western boundary, was near the mouth of the Birs, possibly marked by a border station.  Early Roman cremation remains, found in 1937 by the church in Neuallschwil, show that such a post did exist on the main road north (toward Blotzheim) into Alsace.  The Colonia Raurica, on the whole, contained the modern Canton of Basel, the Frick valley, and the eastern Jura Mountains of the Canton of Solothurn.  The total area of the colony was around 700 km\u00b2.\n\n\n== Subsequent history ==\n\nBy the 2nd century AD, Augusta Raurica was a prosperous commercial trading centre and, in its glory days, the capital of a local Roman province.  It is estimated that the population reached approximately 20,000 people.  Augusta Raurica prospered between the 1st and 3rd centuries, and exported smoked pork and bacon to other parts of the Roman Empire.  The city possessed the typical amenities of a Roman city, an amphitheatre, a main forum, several smaller forums, an aqueduct, a variety of temples, several public baths and the largest Roman theatre north of the Alps, with 8,000 to 10,000 seats.  Many of these sites are open to visitors year-round.\n\nIn 250 AD, a powerful earthquake damaged a large part of the city.  Shortly after, around 260 AD, Alemanni tribes and/or marauding Roman troops destroyed the city.  The Romans attempted to maintain their military position by building a fortress on the Rhine, Castrum Rauracense, the walls of which are still partly intact.  Augusta Raurica was resettled on a much smaller scale on the site of the castrum.  These two settlements form the centers of the modern communities of Augst and Kaiseraugst.\nIn 1442, these communities were divided along the Ergolz and Violenbach rivers.  The western portion was given to Basel, which became a canton of Switzerland in 1501.  In 1833, Augst became part of the Canton of Basel-Land.  The eastern part became part of Habsburg territories and, to differentiate between the two towns, was renamed Kaiseraugst.  Kaiseraugst became part of Switzerland in 1803 after the defeat of the Habsburgs during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n\n== Augusta Raurica today ==\n\nThe excavation site and the late Roman castle, the Castrum Rauracense, are listed as heritage sites of national significance, as are the early Christian baptisterium and the brick kiln at Liebr\u00fcti.\n\n\n=== Excavations ===\nMany of the Roman buildings have been discovered and conserved through excavations, and most are open to the public:\n\nAmphitheatre: only modest remains exist.\nAqueduct: supplied Augusta Raurica with drinking water from the Liestal (parts are visible and accessible in Heidenloch in Liestal, as well as northeast of the treatment plant in F\u00fcllinsdorf).\nMain forum: with the temple of Jupiter, basilica, and the assembly chamber of the town council.\nTheater: forms an architectural unit with the temple across the street.Several private commercial buildings also have been found (a taberna, a bakery, a potter, and a tile kiln), as well as portions of a sewer.  Around 80% of the built-up area has yet to be excavated.  Augusta Raurica is the best-preserved Roman city north of the Alps that has not been built-over in medieval or modern times.\n\n\n=== Museum and Roman house ===\n\nThe Roman Museum houses the most important finds from the Roman city and presents the history of Augusta Raurica.  In the museum, visitors will often find special exhibits, as well as most the significant archaeological find at Augusta Raurica: the silver treasure of Kaiseraugst.  This treasure hoard was found in the fortress in 1961\u20131962, and it is presumed to have once been the property of a commander.  The museum also has a reconstruction of a Roman house, with artifacts and reconstructions showing daily domestic and commercial life from the Roman period.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of archaeological sites by country\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJahresberichte aus Augst und Kaiseraugst.

Located at the border with Germany in the historic region of Alsace, it is the capital of the Bas-Rhin department. \nIn 2017, the city proper had 280,966 inhabitants and both the Eurom\u00e9tropole de Strasbourg (Greater Strasbourg) and the Arrondissement of Strasbourg had 494,089 inhabitants. Strasbourg's metropolitan area had a population of 785,839 in 2016 (not counting the section across the border in Germany), making it the ninth-largest metro area in France and home to 13% of the Grand Est region's inhabitants. The transnational Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Ortenau had a population of 958,421 inhabitants.Strasbourg is one of the de facto four main capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Luxembourg and Frankfurt), as it is the seat of several European institutions, such as the European Parliament, the Eurocorps and the European Ombudsman of the European Union. An organization separate from the European Union, the Council of Europe (with its European Court of Human Rights, its European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines most commonly known in French as \"Pharmacop\u00e9e Europ\u00e9enne\" its European Audiovisual Observatory) is also located in the city. \nTogether with Basel (Bank for International Settlements), Geneva (United Nations headquarters in Europe) and New York City (United Nations world headquarters), Strasbourg is among the few cities in the world not being a state capital and hosting international organisations of the first order. The city is the seat of many non-European international institutions such as the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine and the International Institute of Human Rights. It is the second city in France in terms of international congress and symposia, after Paris.\nStrasbourg's historic city centre, the Grande \u00cele (Grand Island), was classified a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988, the first time such an honour was placed on an entire city centre. Strasbourg is immersed in Franco-German culture and although violently disputed throughout history, has been a cultural bridge between France and Germany for centuries, especially through the University of Strasbourg, currently the second-largest in France, and the coexistence of Catholic and Protestant culture. It is also home to the largest Islamic place of worship in France, the Strasbourg Grand Mosque.Economically, Strasbourg is an important centre of manufacturing and engineering, as well as a hub of road, rail, and river transportation. The port of Strasbourg is the second-largest on the Rhine after Duisburg in Germany, and the second-largest river port in France after Paris.\n\n\n== Etymology and names ==\nBefore the 5th century, the city was known as Argantorati (in the nominative, Argantorate in the locative), a Celtic Gaulish name Latinized first as Argentorate (with Gaulish locative ending, as appearing on the first Roman milestones in the 1st century BC), and then as Argentoratum (with regular Latin nominative ending, in later Latin texts). That Gaulish name is a compound of -rati, the Gaulish word for fortified enclosures, cognate to the Old Irish r\u00e1th (see ringfort), and arganto(n)- (cognate to Latin argentum, which gave modern French argent), the Gaulish word for silver, but also any precious metal, particularly gold, suggesting either a fortified enclosure located by a river gold mining site, or hoarding gold mined in the nearby rivers.After the 5th century, the city became known by a completely different name Gallicized as Strasbourg (Lower Alsatian: Strossburi; German: Stra\u00dfburg). That name is of Germanic origin and means  'town (at the crossing) of roads'. The modern Stras- is cognate to the German Stra\u00dfe and English street, all of which are derived from Latin strata (\"paved road\"), while -bourg is cognate to the German Burg and English borough, all of which are derived from Proto-Germanic *burgz (\"hill fort, fortress\").\nGregory of Tours was the first to mention the name change: in the tenth book of his History of the Franks written shortly after 590 he said that Egidius, Bishop of Reims, accused of plotting against King Childebert II of Austrasia in favor of his uncle King Chilperic I of Neustria, was tried by a synod of Austrasian bishops in Metz in November 590, found guilty and removed from the priesthood, then taken \"ad Argentoratensem urbem, quam nunc Strateburgum vocant\" (\"to the city of Argentoratum, which they now call Strateburgus\"), where he was exiled.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nStrasbourg is situated at the eastern border of France with Germany. This border is formed by the Rhine, which also forms the eastern border of the modern city, facing across the river to the German town Kehl. The historic core of Strasbourg, however, lies on the Grande \u00cele in the river Ill, which here flows parallel to, and roughly 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from, the Rhine. The natural courses of the two rivers eventually join some distance downstream of Strasbourg, although several artificial waterways now connect them within the city.\nThe city lies in the Upper Rhine Plain, at between 132 metres (433 ft) and 151 metres (495 ft) above sea level, with the upland areas of the Vosges Mountains some 20 km (12 mi) to the west and the Black Forest 25 km (16 mi) to the east. This section of the Rhine valley is a major axis of north\u2013south travel, with river traffic on the Rhine itself, and major roads and railways paralleling it on both banks.\nThe city is some 397 kilometres (247 mi) east of Paris. The mouth of the Rhine lies approximately 450 kilometres (280 mi) to the north, or 650 kilometres (400 mi) as the river flows, whilst the head of navigation in Basel is some 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the south, or 150 kilometres (93 mi) by river.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nIn spite of its position far inland, Strasbourg's climate is classified as oceanic (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb),  but a \"semicontinental\" climate with some degree of maritime influence in relation to the mild patterns of Western and Southern France (only considering the country internally). The city has warm, relatively sunny summers and cool, overcast winters. Precipitation is elevated from mid-spring to the end of summer, but remains largely constant throughout the year, totaling 631.4 mm (24.9 in) annually. On average, snow falls 30 days per year.The second highest temperature ever recorded was 38.5 \u00b0C (101.3 \u00b0F) in August 2003, during the 2003 European heat wave. This record was broken, on June 30, 2019, when it was registered 38.8 \u00b0C (101.8 \u00b0F).  The lowest temperature ever recorded was \u221223.4 \u00b0C (\u221210.1 \u00b0F) in December 1938.Strasbourg's location in the Rhine valley, sheltered from the dominant winds by the Vosges and Black Forest mountains, results in poor natural ventilation, making Strasbourg one of the most atmospherically polluted cities of France. Nonetheless, the progressive disappearance of heavy industry on both banks of the Rhine, as well as effective measures of traffic regulation in and around the city have reduced air pollution.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Roman camp of Argentoratum was first mentioned in 12 BC; the city of Strasbourg which grew from it celebrated its 2,000th anniversary in 1988. The fertile area in the Upper Rhine Plain between the rivers Ill and Rhine had already been populated since the Middle Paleolithic.Between 362 and 1262, Strasbourg was governed by the bishops of Strasbourg; their rule was reinforced in 873 and then more in 982. In 1262, the citizens violently rebelled against the bishop's rule (Battle of Hausbergen) and Strasbourg became a free imperial city. It became a French city in 1681, after the conquest of Alsace by the armies of Louis XIV. In 1871, after the Franco-Prussian War, the city became German again, until 1918 (end of World War I), when it reverted to France. After the defeat of France in 1940 (World War II), Strasbourg came under German control again; since the end of 1944, it is again a French city. In 2016, Strasbourg was promoted from capital of Alsace to capital of Grand Est.\nStrasbourg played an important part in Protestant Reformation, with personalities such as John Calvin, Martin Bucer, Wolfgang Capito, Matthew and Katharina Zell, but also in other aspects of Christianity such as German mysticism, with Johannes Tauler, Pietism, with Philipp Spener, and Reverence for Life, with Albert Schweitzer. Delegates from the city took part in the Protestation at Speyer. It was also one of the first centres of the printing industry with pioneers such as Johannes Gutenberg, Johannes Mentelin, and Heinrich Eggestein. Among the darkest periods in the city's long history were the years 1349 (Strasbourg massacre), 1518 (Dancing plague), 1793 (Reign of Terror), 1870 (Siege of Strasbourg) and the years 1940\u20131944 with the Nazi occupation (atrocities such as the Jewish skeleton collection) and the British and American bombing raids. Some other notable dates were the years 357 (Battle of Argentoratum), 842 (Oaths of Strasbourg), 1538 (establishment of the university), 1605 (world's first newspaper printed by Johann Carolus), 1792 (La Marseillaise), and 1889 (pancreatic origin of diabetes discovered by Minkowski and Von Mering).\nStrasbourg has been the seat of European Institutions since 1949: first of the International Commission on Civil Status and of the Council of Europe, later of the European Parliament, of the European Science Foundation, of Eurocorps, and others as well.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nStrasbourg is divided into the following districts:\nBourse, Esplanade, Krutenau\nCentre R\u00e9publique\nCentre Gare\nConseil des XV, Rotterdam\nCronenbourg, Hautepierre, Poteries, Hohberg\nKoenigshoffen, Montagne-Verte, Elsau\nMeinau\nNeudorf, Schluthfeld, Port du Rhin, Musau\nNeuhof, Stockfeld, Ganzau\nRobertsau, Wacken\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe city is chiefly known for its sandstone Gothic Cathedral with its famous astronomical clock, and for its medieval cityscape of Rhineland black and white timber-framed buildings, particularly in the Petite France district or Gerberviertel (\"tanners' district\") alongside the Ill and in the streets and squares surrounding the cathedral, where the renowned Maison Kammerzell stands out.\nNotable medieval streets include Rue Merci\u00e8re, Rue des Dentelles, Rue du Bain aux Plantes, Rue des Juifs, Rue des Fr\u00e8res, Rue des Tonneliers, Rue du Maroquin, Rue des Charpentiers, Rue des Serruriers, Grand' Rue, Quai des Bateliers, Quai Saint-Nicolas and Quai Saint-Thomas.\nNotable medieval squares include Place de la Cath\u00e9drale, Place du March\u00e9 Gayot, Place Saint-\u00c9tienne, Place du March\u00e9 aux Cochons de Lait and Place Benjamin Zix.\n\nIn addition to the cathedral, Strasbourg houses several other medieval churches that have survived the many wars and destructions that have plagued the city: the Romanesque \u00c9glise Saint-\u00c9tienne, partly destroyed in 1944 by Allied bombing raids; the part-Romanesque, part-Gothic, very large \u00c9glise Saint-Thomas with its Silbermann organ on which Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Albert Schweitzer played; the Gothic \u00c9glise protestante Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune with its crypt dating back to the seventh century and its cloister partly from the eleventh century; the Gothic \u00c9glise Saint-Guillaume with its fine early-Renaissance stained glass and furniture; the Gothic \u00c9glise Saint-Jean; the part-Gothic, part-Art Nouveau \u00c9glise Sainte-Madeleine etc.\nThe Neo-Gothic church Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Catholique (there is also an adjacent church Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Protestant) serves as a shrine for several 15th-century wood-worked and painted altars coming from other, now destroyed churches and installed there for public display; especially the Passion of Christ.\nAmong the numerous secular medieval buildings, the monumental Ancienne Douane (old custom-house) stands out.\nThe German Renaissance has bequeathed the city some noteworthy buildings (especially the current Chambre de commerce et d'industrie, former town hall, on Place Gutenberg), as did the French Baroque and Classicism with several h\u00f4tels particuliers (i.e. palaces), among which the Palais Rohan (1742, now housing three museums) is the most spectacular. Other buildings of its kind are the \"H\u00f4tel de Hanau\" (1736, now the city hall); the H\u00f4tel de Klinglin (1736, now residence of the pr\u00e9fet); the H\u00f4tel des Deux-Ponts (1755, now residence of the military governor); the H\u00f4tel d'Andlau-Klinglin (1725, now seat of the administration of the Port autonome de Strasbourg) etc. The largest baroque building of Strasbourg though is the 150-metre-long (490 ft) 1720s main building of the H\u00f4pital civil.\nAs for French Neo-classicism, it is the Opera House on Place Broglie that most prestigiously represents this style.\nStrasbourg also offers high-class eclecticist buildings in its very extended German district, the Neustadt, being the main memory of Wilhelmian architecture since most of the major cities in Germany proper suffered intensive damage during World War II. Streets, boulevards and avenues are homogeneous, surprisingly high (up to seven stories) and broad examples of German urban lay-out and of this architectural style that summons and mixes up five centuries of European architecture as well as Neo-Egyptian, Neo-Greek and Neo-Babylonian styles. The former imperial palace Palais du Rhin, the most political and thus heavily criticized of all German Strasbourg buildings epitomizes the grand scale and stylistic sturdiness of this period. But the two most handsome and ornate buildings of these times are the \u00c9cole internationale des Pontonniers (the former H\u00f6here M\u00e4dchenschule, with its towers, turrets and multiple round and square angles and the Haute \u00e9cole des arts du Rhin with its lavishly ornate fa\u00e7ade of painted bricks, woodwork and majolica.\n\nNotable streets of the German district include: Avenue de la For\u00eat Noire, Avenue des Vosges, Avenue d'Alsace, Avenue de la Marseillaise, Avenue de la Libert\u00e9, Boulevard de la Victoire, Rue Sell\u00e9nick, Rue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Castelnau, Rue du Mar\u00e9chal Foch, and Rue du Mar\u00e9chal Joffre. Notable squares of the German district include Place de la R\u00e9publique, Place de l'Universit\u00e9, Place Brant, and Place Arnold.\nImpressive examples of Prussian military architecture of the 1880s can be found along the newly reopened Rue du Rempart, displaying large-scale fortifications among which the aptly named Kriegstor (war gate).\nAs for modern and contemporary architecture, Strasbourg possesses some fine Art Nouveau buildings (such as the huge Palais des F\u00eates and houses and villas like Villa Schutzenberger and H\u00f4tel Brion), good examples of post-World War II functional architecture (the Cit\u00e9 Rotterdam, for which Le Corbusier did not succeed in the architectural contest) and, in the very extended Quartier Europ\u00e9en, some spectacular administrative buildings of sometimes utterly large size, among which the European Court of Human Rights building by Richard Rogers is arguably the finest. Other noticeable contemporary buildings are the new Music school Cit\u00e9 de la Musique et de la Danse, the Mus\u00e9e d'Art moderne et contemporain and the H\u00f4tel du D\u00e9partement facing it, as well as, in the outskirts, the tramway-station Hoenheim-Nord designed by Zaha Hadid.\n\nThe city has many bridges, including the medieval and four-towered Ponts Couverts that, despite their name, are no longer covered. Next to the Ponts Couverts is the Barrage Vauban, a part of Vauban's 17th-century fortifications, that does include a covered bridge. Other bridges are the ornate 19th-century Pont de la Fonderie (1893, stone) and Pont d'Auvergne (1892, iron), as well as architect Marc Mimram's futuristic Passerelle over the Rhine, opened in 2004.\nThe largest square at the centre of the city of Strasbourg is the Place Kl\u00e9ber. Located in the heart of the city's commercial area, it was named after general Jean-Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber, born in Strasbourg in 1753 and assassinated in 1800 in Cairo. In the square is a statue of Kl\u00e9ber, under which is a vault containing his remains. On the north side of the square is the Aubette (Orderly Room), built by Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, architect of the king, in 1765\u20131772.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nStrasbourg features a number of prominent parks, of which several are of cultural and historical interest: the Parc de l'Orangerie, laid out as a French garden by Andr\u00e9 le N\u00f4tre and remodeled as an English garden on behalf of Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais, now displaying noteworthy French gardens, a neo-classical castle and a small zoo; the Parc de la Citadelle, built around impressive remains of the 17th-century fortress erected close to the Rhine by Vauban;  the Parc de Pourtal\u00e8s, laid out in English style around a baroque castle (heavily restored in the 19th century) that now houses a small three-star hotel, and featuring an open-air museum of international contemporary sculpture.\nThe Jardin botanique de l'Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg (botanical garden) was created under the German administration next to the Observatory of Strasbourg, built in 1881, and still owns some greenhouses of those times. The Parc des Contades, although the oldest park of the city, was completely remodeled after World War II. The futuristic Parc des Poteries is an example of European park-conception in the late 1990s. The Jardin des deux Rives, spread over Strasbourg and Kehl on both sides of the Rhine opened in 2004 and is the most extended (60-hectare) park of the agglomeration. The most recent park is Parc du Heyritz (8,7 ha), opened in 2014 along a canal facing the h\u00f4pital civil.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nAs of 2020, the city of Strasbourg has eleven municipal museums (including Aubette 1928), eleven university museums, and at least two privately owned museums (Mus\u00e9e vodou and Mus\u00e9e du barreau de Strasbourg). Five communes in the metropolitan area also have museums (see below), three of them dedicated to military history.\n\n\n==== Overview ====\nThe collections in Strasbourg are distributed over a wide range of museums, according to a system that takes into account not only the types and geographical provenances of the items, but also the epochs. This concerns in particular the following domains:\n\nOld master paintings from the Germanic Rhenish territories and until 1681 are displayed in the Mus\u00e9e de l'\u0152uvre Notre-Dame (MOND); old master paintings from all the rest of Europe (including the Dutch Rhenish territories) and until 1871, as well as old master paintings from the Germanic Rhenish territories between 1681 and 1871, are displayed in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts; paintings since 1871 are displayed in the Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne et contemporain (MAMCS).\nDecorative arts until 1681 are on display in the MOND, decorative arts from the years 1681 until 1871 are on display in the Mus\u00e9e des arts d\u00e9coratifs, decorative arts after 1871 are on display at the MAMCS, with items from each epoch also shown in the Mus\u00e9e historique.\nPrints and drawings until 1871 are displayed in the Cabinet des estampes et dessins, save for the original plans of Strasbourg Cathedral, displayed in the MOND. Prints and drawings after 1871 are displayed in the MAMCS, and in the Mus\u00e9e Tomi Ungerer/Centre international de l\u2019illustration (the combined number of prints and drawings amounts to well over 200,000).\nArtefacts from Ancient Egypt are on display in two entirely different collections, one in the Mus\u00e9e arch\u00e9ologique and the other belonging to the Instituts d'\u00c9gyptologie et de Papyrologie of the University of Strasbourg.\n\n\n==== Fine art museums ====\n\nThe Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts owns paintings by Hans Memling, Francisco de Goya, Tintoretto, Paolo Veronese, Giotto di Bondone, Sandro Botticelli, Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, El Greco, Correggio, Cima da Conegliano and Piero di Cosimo, among others.\nThe Mus\u00e9e de l'\u0152uvre Notre-Dame (located in a part-Gothic, part-Renaissance building next to the Cathedral) houses a large and renowned collection of medieval and Renaissance upper-Rhenish art, among which original sculptures, plans and stained glass from the Cathedral and paintings by Hans Baldung and Sebastian Stoskopff.\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art moderne et contemporain is among the largest museums of its kind in France.\nThe Mus\u00e9e des Arts d\u00e9coratifs, located in the sumptuous former residence of the cardinals of Rohan, the Palais Rohan displays a reputable collection of 18th century furniture and china.\nThe Cabinet des estampes et des dessins displays five centuries of engravings and drawings, but also woodcuts and lithographies.\nThe Mus\u00e9e Tomi Ungerer/Centre international de l'illustration, located in a large former villa next to the Theatre, displays original works by Ungerer and other artists (Saul Steinberg, Ronald Searle ... ) as well as Ungerer's large collection of ancient toys.\n\n\n==== Other museums ====\nThe Mus\u00e9e arch\u00e9ologique presents a large display of regional findings from the first ages of man to the sixth century, focussing especially on the Roman and Celtic period. It also includes a collection of works from Ancient Egypt, and Ancient Greece, assembled and bequeathed by Gustave Schlumberger.\nThe Mus\u00e9e alsacien is dedicated to traditional Alsatian daily life.\nLe Vaisseau (\"The vessel\") is a science and technology centre, especially designed for children.\nThe Mus\u00e9e historique (historical museum) is dedicated to the tumultuous history of the city and displays many artifacts of the times, among which the 'Gr\u00fcselhorn, the horn that was blown every evening at 10:00, during medieval times, to order the Jews out of the city.\nThe Mus\u00e9e vodou (Vodou museum) opened its doors on 28 November 2013. Displaying a private collection of artefacts from Haiti, it is located in a former water tower (ch\u00e2teau d'eau) built in 1883 and classified as a Monument historique.\nThe Mus\u00e9e du barreau de Strasbourg (The Strasbourg bar association museum) is a museum dedicated to the work and the history of lawyers in the city.\n\n\n==== University museums ====\nThe Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg is in charge of a number of permanent public displays of its collections of scientific artefacts and products of all kinds of exploration and research.\nThe Mus\u00e9e zoologique is one of the oldest in France and is especially famous for its collection of birds. The museum is co-administrated by the municipality.\nThe Gypsoth\u00e8que (also known as Mus\u00e9e des moulages or Mus\u00e9e Adolf Michaelis) is France's second-largest cast collection and the largest university cast collection in France.\nThe Mus\u00e9e de Sismologie et Magn\u00e9tisme terrestre displays antique instruments of measure\nThe Mus\u00e9e Pasteur is a collection of medical curiosities\nThe Mus\u00e9e de min\u00e9ralogie is dedicated to minerals\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'\u00c9gyptologie houses a collections of archaeological findings made in and brought from Egypt and Sudan. This collection is entirely separate from the Schlumberger collection of the Mus\u00e9e arch\u00e9ologique (see above).\nThe Crypte aux \u00e9toiles (\"star crypt\") is situated in the vaulted basement below the Observatory of Strasbourg and displays old telescopes and other antique astronomical devices such as clocks and theodolites.\n\n\n==== Museums in the suburbs ====\nMus\u00e9e Les Secrets du Chocolat (Chocolate museum) in Geispolsheim\nFort Fr\u00e8re in Oberhausbergen\nFort Rapp in Reichstett\nPixel Museum, a video game museum, in Schiltigheim\nMM Park France, a military museum, in La Wantzenau\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe commune of Strasbourg proper had a population of 280,966 on 1 January 2017, the result of a constant moderate annual growth which is also reflected in the constant growth of the number of students at its university (e. g. from 42,000 students in 2010 to 52,000 students in 2019). The metropolitan area of Strasbourg had a population of 785,839 inhabitants in 2016 (French side of the border only), while the transnational Eurodistrict had a population of 958,421 inhabitants.In the Middle Ages, Strasbourg (a Free imperial city since 1262), was an important town. According to a 1444 census, the population was circa 20,000; only one third less than Cologne, then a major European city.\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n\n\n=== Population composition ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\nStrasbourg is the seat of internationally renowned institutions of music and drama:\n\nThe Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg, founded in 1855, one of the oldest symphonic orchestras in western Europe. Based since 1975 in the Palais de la musique et des congr\u00e8s.\nThe Op\u00e9ra national du Rhin\nThe Th\u00e9\u00e2tre national de Strasbourg\nThe Percussions de Strasbourg\nThe Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Maillon\nThe \"Laiterie\"\nJoshy's house - a venue for performance poetry and freestyle urban music.\nAu Z\u00e9nithOther theatres are the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre jeune public, the TAPS Scala, the Kafteur ...  \n\n\n=== Events ===\nMusica, international festival of contemporary classical music (autumn)\nFestival international de Strasbourg (founded in 1932), festival of classical music and jazz (summer)\nFestival des Artefacts, festival of contemporary non-classical music\nLes Nuits \u00e9lectroniques de l'Ososph\u00e8re\nThe Spectre Film Festival is an annual film festival devoted to science fiction, horror and fantasy.\nThe Strasbourg International Film Festival is an annual film festival focusing on new and emerging independent filmmakers from around the world.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and tertiary education ===\nStrasbourg, well known as centre of humanism, has a long history of excellence in higher-education, at the crossroads of French and German intellectual traditions. Although Strasbourg had been annexed by the Kingdom of France in 1683, it still remained connected to the German-speaking intellectual world throughout the 18th century, and the university attracted numerous students from the Holy Roman Empire, with Goethe, Metternich and Montgelas, who studied law in Strasbourg, among the most prominent. With 19 Nobel prizes in total, Strasbourg is the most eminent French university outside of Paris.\nUp until January 2009, there were three universities in Strasbourg, with an approximate total of 48,500 students as of 2007 (another 4,500 students are being taught at one of the diverse post-graduate schools):\nStrasbourg I \u2013 Louis Pasteur University\nStrasbourg II \u2013 Marc Bloch University\nStrasbourg III \u2013 Robert Schuman UniversityAs of 1 January 2009, those three universities have merged and now constitute the Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg.\nSchools part of the Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg include:\n\nSciences Po Strasbourg (Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Strasbourg), the University of Strasbourg's political science & international studies center\nThe EMS (EM Strasbourg Business School), the University of Strasbourg's business school\nThe INSA (Institut national des sciences appliqu\u00e9es), the University of Strasbourg's engineering school\nThe ENA (\u00c9cole nationale d'administration). ENA trains most of the nation's high-ranking civil servants. The relocation to Strasbourg was meant to give a European vocation to the school and to implement the French government's \"d\u00e9centralisation\" plan.\nThe ESAD (\u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure des arts d\u00e9coratifs) is an art school of European reputation.\nThe ISEG Group (Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group)\nThe ISU (International Space University) is located in the south of Strasbourg (Illkirch-Graffenstaden).\nThe ECPM (\u00c9cole europ\u00e9enne de chimie, polym\u00e8res et mat\u00e9riaux)\nThe EPITA (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les techniques avanc\u00e9es)\nThe EPITECH (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies)\nThe INET (Institut national des \u00e9tudes territoriales)\nThe IIEF (Institut international d'\u00e9tudes fran\u00e7aises)\nThe ENGEES (\u00c9cole nationale du g\u00e9nie de l'eau et de l'environnement de Strasbourg)\nThe CUEJ (Centre universitaire d'enseignement du journalisme)\nT\u00c9L\u00c9COM Physique Strasbourg (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de physique de Strasbourg), Institute of Technology, located in the South of Strasbourg (Illkirch-Graffenstaden)\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nInternational schools include:\nMultiple levels:\n\nEuropean School of Strasbourg (priority given to children whose parents are employed at the European institutions)For elementary education:\n\u00c9cole Internationale Robert Schuman\nStrasbourg International School\nInternational School at Lucie Berger\nRussian Mission School in StrasbourgFor middle school/junior high school education:\nColl\u00e8ge International de l'EsplanadeFor senior high school/sixth form college:\nLyc\u00e9e international des Pontonniers (FR)\n\n\n== Libraries ==\n\nThe Biblioth\u00e8que nationale et universitaire (BNU) is, with its collection of more than 3,000,000 titles, the second-largest library in France after the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France. It was founded by the German administration after the complete destruction of the previous municipal library in 1871 and holds the unique status of being simultaneously a students' and a national library. The Strasbourg municipal library had been marked erroneously as \"City Hall\" in a French commercial map, which had been captured and used by the German artillery to lay their guns. A librarian from Munich later pointed out \"...that the destruction of the precious collection was not the fault of a German artillery officer, who used the French map, but of the slovenly and inaccurate scholarship of a Frenchman.\"The municipal library Biblioth\u00e8que municipale de Strasbourg (BMS) administrates a network of ten medium-sized librairies in different areas of the town. A six stories high \"Grande biblioth\u00e8que\", the M\u00e9diath\u00e8que Andr\u00e9 Malraux, was inaugurated on 19 September 2008 and is considered the largest in Eastern France.\n\n\n=== Incunabula ===\nAs one of the earliest centers of book-printing in Europe (see above: History), Strasbourg for a long time held a large number of incunabula \u2014 books printed before 1500 \u2014 in its library as one of its most precious heritages: no less than 7,000. After the total destruction of this institution in 1870, however, a new collection had to be reassembled from scratch. Today, Strasbourg's different public and institutional libraries again display a sizable total number of incunabula, distributed as follows: Biblioth\u00e8que nationale et universitaire, ca. 2,120, M\u00e9diath\u00e8que de la ville et de la communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Strasbourg, 349, Biblioth\u00e8que du Grand S\u00e9minaire, 238, M\u00e9diath\u00e8que protestante, 66, and Biblioth\u00e8que alsatique du Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel, 5.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nTrain services operate from the Gare de Strasbourg, the city's main station in the city centre, eastward to Offenburg and Karlsruhe in Germany, westward to Metz and Paris, and southward to Basel. Strasbourg's links with the rest of France have improved due to its recent connection to the TGV network, with the first phase of the TGV Est (Paris\u2013Strasbourg) in 2007, the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne (Strasbourg-Lyon) in 2012, and the second phase of the TGV Est in July 2016.\nStrasbourg also has its own airport, serving major domestic destinations as well as international destinations in Europe and northern Africa. The airport is linked to the Gare de Strasbourg by a frequent train service.City transportation in Strasbourg includes the futurist-looking Strasbourg tramway that opened in 1994 and is operated by the regional transit company Compagnie des Transports Strasbourgeois (CTS), consisting of 6 lines with a total length of 55.8 km (34.7 mi). The CTS also operates a comprehensive bus network throughout the city that is integrated with the trams. With more than 500 km (311 mi) of bicycle paths, biking in the city is convenient and the CTS operates a cheap bike-sharing scheme named V\u00e9lhop'. The CTS, and its predecessors, also operated a previous generation of tram system between 1878 and 1960, complemented by trolleybus routes between 1939 and 1962.\nBeing a city on the Ill and close to the Rhine, Strasbourg has always been an important centre of fluvial navigation, as is attested by archeological findings. In 1682 the Canal de la Bruche was added to the river navigations, initially to provide transport for sandstone from quarries in the Vosges for use in the fortification of the city. That canal has since closed, but the subsequent Canal du Rhone au Rhine, Canal de la Marne au Rhin and Grand Canal d'Alsace are still in use, as is the important activity of the Port autonome de Strasbourg. Water tourism inside the city proper attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.\nThe tram system that now criss-crosses the historic city centre complements walking and biking in it. The centre has been transformed into a pedestrian priority zone that enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable, safe and enjoyable. These attributes are accomplished by applying the principle of \"filtered permeability\" to the existing irregular network of streets. It means that the network adaptations favour active transportation and, selectively, \"filter out\" the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre. In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces increasing the enjoyment of the trip. This logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts \u2013 the Fused Grid.\nAt present the A35 autoroute, which parallels the Rhine between Karlsruhe and Basel, and the A4 autoroute, which links Paris with Strasbourg, penetrate close to the centre of the city. The Grand contournement ouest (GCO) project, programmed since 1999, plans to construct a 24-kilometre-long (15 mi) highway connection between the junctions of the A4 and the A35 autoroutes in the north and of the A35 and A352 autoroutes in the south. This routes well to the west of the city and is meant to divest a significant portion of motorized traffic from the unit\u00e9 urbaine.

        "wiki": "R\u00f6tteln Castle (German: Burg R\u00f6tteln), located above the L\u00f6rrach suburb of Haagen, lies in the extreme southwest corner of the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, just 10 kilometres (6 miles) north-east of the Swiss City of Basel. The fortification was one of the most powerful in the southwest, and today, it is the third largest castle ruin in Baden.The ruins of the castle are situated on a widely visible forested hill 422 metres (1,385 ft) above sea level. The keep lies on a spur projecting from the steep-sided east side of the lower Wiese valley.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe castle has probably existed since the beginning of the 11th century. The first documented mention of a lord of R\u00f6tteln, one Dietrich von R\u00f6tteln, the bailiff of St. Albans near Basel, is 1102. This year is also considered the date of the founding of the city of L\u00f6rrach. In 1204 Dietrich III of R\u00f6tteln died, having amassed a large holding in the Wiese valley. His sons held high offices; Walter I was the Kapitular (a priest who is authorized to say the mass in a cathedral and perform other duties of a bishop) of Konstanz and Basel, Luithold I was the bishop of Basel, Konrad I was the founder of the city of Schopfheim, which was important to the later formation of the Markgr\u00e4flerland. The first documented mention of the castle itself is from the year 1259.\nLuithold II von R\u00f6tteln, the last male of his line, gave the lordship of R\u00f6tteln to the Margrave Rudolf I of Hachberg-Sausenberg and his heiress Agnes von R\u00f6tteln in the year 1311. As a result, the Margrave of Hachberg-Sausenberg also became lord of the former domain of R\u00f6tteln. The Margrave then moved from Sausenburg Castle to R\u00f6tteln Castle to more easily administer his new domain and appointed a bailiff to oversee Sausenburg.\nLuithold II von R\u00f6tteln died on May 19, 1316, and the passing of R\u00f6tteln to Hachberg-Sausenburg was an important step in the eventual formation of the Markgr\u00e4flerland. In 1332, the castle was besieged by the people of Basel because the Margrave Rudolf II stabbed the mayor of Basel during an argument. The conflict was resolved at the last moment through an agreement to settle the argument. Arrowheads, crossbow bolts, and other finds near the castle attest to this siege.\nThe Basel earthquake of 1356 destroyed large portions of the city and the castle suffered severe damage.\nIn 1444, the domain of Badenweiler passed from the last Count of Freiburg, John, to the son of Margrave Wilhelm, Rudolf IV von Hachberg-Sausenberg. The combination of the three dominions, R\u00f6tteln, Sausenburg, and Badenweiler formed the foundation of the Markgr\u00e4flerland.\nIn 1503, the castle came into the possession of the Margrave of Baden. During the German Peasants' War in 1525, revolting peasants briefly took possession of the castle.\nFrom 1618 to 1648, during the Thirty Years War, the castle was occupied by both Swedish and Imperial forces.\nDuring the Franco-Dutch War, on June 29, 1678, the castles of R\u00f6tteln, Sausenburg, and Badenweiler were destroyed by the army of the French Marshall Fran\u00e7ois de Cr\u00e9quy. The castle ruins were thereafter used as a source of building stone (quarry).\nThe Black Forest Society of Baden (Schwarzwaldverein) began to survey the ruins in 1884 in order to preserve them. Since 1926, this has been the concern of the R\u00f6ttelnbund e.V. club based in L\u00f6rrach-Haagen. Today the ruins have been restored to their approximate condition in 1678.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe site of the castle extends from northwest to southwest over a distance of almost 300 metres (980 ft). The widely spread castle can be roughly divided into the fore-castle and upper castle. To the west, a bastion-like point extends for the placement of light artillery. Passage from the fore-castle to the upper castle is by means of a drawbridge. The upper castle, with its powerful keep, is the oldest part of the castle.  Archaeological finds from the castle and grounds are on display in the museum located in the courtyard of the castle.\n\n\n=== The Kapf, the bastion and the south gate ===\nThe free place called Kapf in front of the entrance to the south gate served as a meeting place for the regional court\u2014the court of appeals for the village courts. The provincial governor had the presidency. He was assisted by the landschreiber (deputy of the provincial governor and first law officer) and seven free men as judges. The seven came from respected families of the territorial estates (an early democratic institution with some rights of self-government). Death sentences pronounced by the regional court were promptly executed on the Kapf. After 1503, the Margraves of Baden converted the Kapf into a bastion formed as a star-shaped redoubt. On French orders, the bastion had to be dragged (destroyed) in January 1689. The stones were used by the French to build their fortress at Huningue (on the left bank of the river Rhein just before the city of Basel).\n\nThe outer bailey is entered via the south gate. The deeply staggered gatehouse consisting of three gates was also a tower. The apex of the portal contains a slab with the coat of arms of the builder-owner, Marquis Rudolf IV of Hachberg-Sausenberg (today just a copy). It is marked with the date 1468. The original of the coat of arms and the court table of the Kapf are exhibited in the Dreil\u00e4ndermuseum in L\u00f6rrach.\n\n\n=== The outer bailey ===\nThe outer bailey or lower castle was developed in the 14th and 15th centuries, though it had historically been a farmstead belonging to the castle. The outer bailey was surrounded by a high ring wall with flanking towers. On the west side, the defense system is well preserved. The area inside the wall was densely built with a broad lane halfway through. The farmstead, the administration and the garrison with up to 300 mercenaries from all over Europe have characterized the overall picture. The farmstead, storage buildings, and lodgings for maids, servants, craftsmen and their families made a fortified village out of the outer bailey.\nA 1377 document mentions an innkeeper living in the outer bailey. The inhabitants of the castle, artisans, peasants and travelers were invited to make a stop at the inn. The caf\u00e9 on the grounds of the castle is a modern building but it is probably situated on the site of the medieval inn.\nTo the east, on the way to the inner bailey, there is the landschreiberei that was the most important institution of the administration of the Marquis of Baden. The landschreiberei housed the office and the archive and local officers kept in touch with the remote residence in Durlach (today Karlsruhe-Durlach). The striking four-story building dates back to the late Middle Ages. It was rebuilt by the R\u00f6ttelnbund in 1985 and now houses event locations, the archive and museum, as well as the kiosk in the entrance area.\n\n\n=== Access to the inner bailey (upper castle) ===\n\nThere is no other castle in the surrounding area in which the sophisticated access technology has been preserved as visibly. Since the upper or main castle is the heart of the whole system, it was specially protected. The upper castle is enclosed by a curtain wall with a defense walk. The upper castle features a moat which was created by removing the bedrock in between the inner and outer bailey.  The wooden bridge to cross the moat is located at the only passage through the curtain wall.\nAt one time the moat was very deep and the connection between the lower and the upper castle was provided by a drawbridge. The old support pillars of the drawbridge carry the current steel bridge.\nIn addition to the main gate, the narrow manhole (today closed by a fence) grants access to individuals. This access was also fortified by a drawbridge. Above the apex of the main gate there is a sandstone slab sculpted with the coat of arms of the builders and powerful owners of the castle\u2014the Margraves of Hachberg-Sausenberg.\nBehind the main gate there are huge windowless walls. To enter the inner bailey of the upper castle, the three-gate safety installation must be passed. The gate defense tower, named Giller rises from the curtain wall on the left.\n\n\n=== Cellar under the manor house ===\nA castle is not only the ancestral home of a noble family and a center of power, but also the heart of an economic enterprise. From here, the widely scattered property was operated and managed. The alimentation and health of the numerous inhabitants of the castle had to be ensured even in the case of a long-lasting siege. Adequate storage was therefore indispensable. Large cellar rooms for storage were built within the castle.\nUnder the old building or manor house is a large wine cellar with a vault. Originally, the cellar had a simple wood-beamed ceiling. In the second half of the 14th century, Margrave Rudolf III carried out major reconstruction work on the manor house. It was probably at this time that the wooden ceiling of the cellar was replaced by a barrel vault\u2014a series of arches placed side by side to form a barrel roof.\n\n\n=== Giller and cistern ===\n\nThe gate defense tower, Giller, secured the only entrance to the upper castle especially before the expansion of the outer ward (lower castle). At times, it also served as a prison tower; inside, parts of jougs (iron collar), footcuffs, handcuffs, and stone weights have been found.\nOriginally, the Giller was shorter but during reconstruction work in 1926, a storey with battlements made of concrete was added.\nA deep castle well was mentioned in 1420 that refer to a cistern. Since the water table in the area is deep and difficult to get to, surface water was collected in the cistern. \nCisterns of this kind are rare in southern Germany. The 8-to-10-metre-deep (26 to 33 ft) shaft was surrounded by a sheath of gravel and sand and sealed with a clay layer to the outside. Incoming surface water seeped through the filter material into the interior of the shaft and into the cistern. The water in the cistern had an exceptionally good quality.\n\n\n=== Palas (manor house) and castle chapel ===\nThe palas, or manor house, was the residence of the ruler and at the same time representative building.representative building It was built in three phases: the oldest part of the building is the southern, then the north side of the building was built, and, last, the portion of the building and close to the keep was constructed.\nThe palas has three storeys, but only the top floor went through all three phases of construction. It is clearly visible that the initial building was extended once and then again in later years.\n\nThe oldest part of the building dates back to the time of the noble lords of R\u00f6tteln in the 13th century. The downstairs area contains a knights' hall which was used for social events. Above the knights' hall were the living and sleeping areas. The second oldest portion of the building housed the kitchen. The newest part of the palas was built under the reign of Margrave Philip of Hachberg-Sausenberg (1454\u20131503). The keystone of the entrance portal is decorated with the coat of arms of the Margrave and his wife Maria of Savoy (1455\u20131511).\nThe spacious ballroom occupied the entire area of the top floor. There are benches in the niches of its large windows. The embrasure of windows and portals of the newest construction show exceptionally fine designs. They bear witness to the Margrave's, who belonged to the Burgundians and later on to the French court, demanding need for representation. The new building was comfortable: there were numerous smaller rooms that were heated with cocklestoves and toilet facilities on the eastern exterior wall.\nThe chapel of St. Mary (consecrated 1504) on the north side of the bailey was an elongated hall with two columns in the center axis that supported a ribbed vaulting in late Gothic style. It is assumed that the burial place of Margrave Rudolf IV (death 1487) is within the chapel.\n\n\n=== The keep (Bergfried) ===\nThe Bergfried, or keep, stands at the highest point of the castle. Its construction dates back to the early days of the castle among the free nobles of R\u00f6tteln but may be older. The original entrance is located at the south side on the third storey of the tower. It was only accessible via ladders or a wooden staircase. The current entrance is modern. \nThe Bergfried was a watchtower, a retreat for defense, and a prison tower. Along with the curtain wall and the neck ditch, the Bergfried formed the most important element in the defense system of the upper castle.\nThe prolonged construction period of the keep can be seen in the stones of the Bergfried\u2014the stones and building technique change with increasing height. On the lower layers, the stone construction is remarkable and is found only in Romanesque churches of the area but for castles it is unique in the region of Baden.\nThe top of the Bergfried allows for a view of the whole castle, into the valley of the river Wiese, to the Black Forest, to the Swiss Jura and the Alsatian Vosges mountain range,  and sometimes even the Bernese Alps.\n\n\n== Furnishing and inventory ==\n\nDue to the castle's former representative character, it is assumed that the interior was also decorated splendidly and expensively. Pilgrim Hans von Waltheim from Halle an der Saale, having visited the castle on July 9, 1474, marvelled at the tapestries in the cabinet and said that they had the most beautiful workmanship of pictures, of countenance, of clothing, of animals and flowers and other work, as if they lived. The luxurious tapestries and fireplaces lead back to the large rooms, especially inside of the palas. The palas was difficult to heat and carpets were attached to the cold walls to create a warmth. Smaller rooms were panelled with wood.Additional evidence of the sophisticated inventory can be seen in the stove tiles which are exhibited in the castle's museum and the Dreil\u00e4ndermuseum in L\u00f6rrach. In the 14th century, chimneys and fireplaces had large tiles to store heat and allowed more even and widespread heating. Some ovens were made of clay, but others were made of cast iron which could both absorb and emit heat faster. R\u00f6tteln Castle had been equipped with at least 10 to 15 masonry heaters. Many of them date back to the time of Rudolf IV and Philip who imported them from Burgundy and Romandy. Some tiles carry highly artistic ornaments and biblical scenes in relief.R\u00f6tteln castle was equipped with workshops dedicated to the production of furniture and a known Burgundian tapestry craftsman produced tapestries there.Many items have been found during restoration work\u2014round shots, arrowheads and other either completely or partially preserved weapons, but also items of daily life such as harnesses, buttons, tools, desk bells and door locks. Findings and historic illustrations which show the castle's history are exhibited at the museum of the castle. The majority of the findings are exhibited at the Dreil\u00e4ndermuseum in L\u00f6rrach. These include tiles, glassware, fragments of tableware, tools, parts of weapons, pipes, a chessman, a judge's table along with an executioner's sword and different instruments of torture.\n\n\n== Usage today ==\n\nThe castle ruin is open throughout the year and tours can be arranged in advance. While the lower castle can be visited anytime for free, the upper castle has different, seasonal hours. In addition to a museum in the reconstructed district offices, a tavern can be found inside the fortification. The castle is federal state-owned and is being maintained by the institution Staatliche Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Both the upkeep and the maintenance are taken care of by R\u00f6ttelnbund e.V. The upper castle is visited by nearly 50,000 people annually. The tavern and the pub garden belong to the city of L\u00f6rrach and each space can be leased for events. Since December 2017, the city runs a caf\u00e9. The registry office of L\u00f6rrach operates a wedding hall within the reconstructed district offices. The Knechtstube (servant's parlour) can seat 25 people. Around 25 weddings take place there every year.Since 1968, the society Burgfestspiele R\u00f6tteln performs classic plays on the outdoor stage in the outer bailey every year. Since 2007, another festival called Jazz auf der Burg(jazz at the castle) takes place and is supported by the Jazz-Club 56. In summer 2003, an open-air cinema was mounted.Since 1938, the R\u00f6tteln Castle and surrounding area is acknowledged as a conservation area with the description: \"very remarkable, large castle ruin within scenically excellent location and environment, especially arboretums, bushes, meadows, forest border.\"\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHelmut Bender u. a.: Burgen im s\u00fcdlichen Baden.

The entrance fee to the Castles inner courtyard is 2.50 \u20ac for adults and 1.00 \u20ac for children (6-14), but the ruin is well maintained. Both towers can be visited and have a wonderful panoramic view over the closer and more distant surroundings.",

          "Nice ruins to visit in the area. Great view of the town of L\u00f6rrach from the top and its worth going to if you are in the area. There are two towers, and it is worth walking up them to see the view from the highest part of the castle. Fun place for kids, and cheap to go here.",
          "A nice quiet castle ruins to visit.  Climb both towers to see in all directions.  Views to Basel and mountain peaks in France and Germany.  Nearby the views of rolling hills and farmland are beautiful.  We visited by hiking from Kandern through the forest which made for a very nice day."

          "It is well tended, beautiful garden. There are also many varieties of plants from Asia, Anatolia and local species. However, many of the labels in German only. It would be great for tourists to have it written in English as well",
          "Lovely walks around these superbly kept gardens , very easily reached from central Basel on the 14 tram. Loads to see with a large park right next door with large cafeteria and kids activities. Well worth a couple of hours.",
          "If you are staying in Basel and feel the need to escape the hustle and bustle of the city centre, then I would recommend a trip to the Merian Garten. You can get a train from Basel main station for the short 4-5 minute ride to Dreispitz station and then take a 5-6 minute walk",
          "We probably came on the worst day of the year; mid December and raining all day. But it was easy to see what a nice place this. You can easily spend half a day here.",
          "A short distance from the city center, Merian Garten provides an opportunity to appreciate Basel and its surroundings outside of the busy city center. A visit is recommended for a stroll around the gardens and along the hills as well as lunch at the house restaurant. Merian",
          "By far my most visited place in Basel. You can take the number 10 tram easily or simply walk from M-Parc. There are two lovely places to get a little bite or coffee but the cafeteria by the lake has the most seating and food options. It is cafeteria style, so just put what",
          "What a beautiful garden with an amazing allotment and small holding. Such peace can be found here. It was well worth the visit for a bit of escapism",
          "Merian Garten and Park im Gr\u00fcnen are close to each other. During spring the Merian Garten is full of the most beautiful and colorful flowers",
          "Loved this garden! We enjoyed the animals, plants, and the the maze. It was difficult for us to find as the sign before the garden pointed left. We went left and got lost.",

          "We came to meet friends at the Villa Merian and were fascinated by the size and the multiple offerings in this wonderful garden space. There are a variety of different gardens and at least two restaurants. The smaller and more enjoyable of the two is the Villa Merian. A manor",
          "This huge and diverse park is the largest in Switzerland for sure and one of the largest in Europe. It is totally free and open 365 days from 8 AM to sunset. Even if there are no flowers in winter, it is well worth visiting it. There are also a lake, a small river, different",
          "We were at thus place at the last Saturday of the month, when the old mill is in operation. It was very nice for the kids to learn how grains were ground with the grind stone and the river. Also the flower \ud83c\udf38 were very colorful and we had a nice afternoon with the family",
          "Merian Garten is such a lovely place to visit and spend some quality time at a relaxed pace surrounded by nature. The gardens span for nearly 45 acres with so many varieties of flowers, plants and trees to see and appreciate. There is also an English style garden that is",
          "Really wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. A lovely park, nicely set gardens and walkways, a lovely stream running through the park, a pretty lake with loads of birds, some farm yard animals, and even though it was mid winter there was still a lot to see. So good",
          "This is a large park that encompasses many different types of activities. There is a large restaurant, an historic Transportation museum, an old mill wheel and farm animal area, formal gardens, sports fields, a large pond...the list goes on.",

          "Merian Garten is actually a park, really beautiful, with a huge variety of plants. It's great to go there just to walk around and enjoy the greenery, sit under a tree and relax. I went there on a Sunday so there were quite a few people but definitely not crowded. I presume it",
          "Beautifully arranged gardens with a large variety of Rhododendron. It's along a small creek, and very romantic.",
          "It's a park/garden with such an extension, open views on the city and the Rhein, variety of plants and flowers that it cannot fail to impress. Great for runners, couples, families with kids. One of my favourite destinations in town since I discovered it",
          "The gardens are beautiful and scenic, as well as interesting. It's very clean and well maintained. This is a wonderful place to spend a full day with family. The park is large enough to go on long walks, and is scattered with areas for younger children to play to keep them",
          "Beautiful place ! Nice to spend some time there in a Sunday afternoon! In summer when all the veggies and herbs are out it's especially nice!",
          "We often headed here on hot summer days, starting up at Grun 80 before wandering down the river back towards town. Sponsored by Migros (I think), the gardens and farm are popular with school children, teaching them about nature and farming, showing them how plants are grown and",

          "The Merian Garten can be accessed with several public transit options. I took the Tram #10 down to St. Jakobs Park and walked from there to the park. Wow, it has already been two years since my last visit here. This park is really an exceptional place to visit to get away from",
          "The Merian G\u00e4rten are an oasis of tranquility with many interesting plants to enjoy. We were here in the summer but it should be a great place to visit all year round.

          "We were together with a small daughter, it was very quit and nice place. If you're interested in plants, you will enjoy from every square meter of the garden. There is a bistro there (overpriced like everything in Switzerland) to have a lunch/coffee and concerts on summer",
          "It is really worth visiting the Merian G\u00e4rten. They are perfect to get away from the busy and hectic city. The best time to visit is during May and June when the irises are flowering! They are absolutely beautiful! Often they also have a plant identification labyrinth which is",

          "Beautiful and relaxing gardens, well landscaped with interesting plants, yet still managing to cater for the younger age group with play equipment, and areas to run about. Large ponds, the biggest wooden dinosaur I have ever seen, a wonderful 19 cent. carousel, plenty of seating",

          "While I would not think that most people would fid it worthwhile to go too far out of their way to find this garden (and it is slightly off of the beaten tourist path) if you happen to be close by it is definitely worth a detour to check it out. As others have noted, however,",

          "Not quite in the middle of Basel, but surrounded by industrial Dreispitz and the sports complex at St Jacob, it is easy to miss this outstanding garden. Garden is probably the wrong word, because it houses numerous gardens, a large number of sculptures, an exhibition centre, a",
          "Arguably calling these gardens average is being more than fair to them. My wife is a gardener, and wherever we travel, if the City has a Botanic Garden, we go to it. This one was disappointing: it's collection wasn't particularly broad and its design was pedestrian.",

          "In comparison to other city's botanical gardens, it is tiny but in view of the limited amount of green space that Basel has, it is a welcome change. It is also immaculate and quite lovely with the restaurant there.",
          "To be honest, it wasn't what I was expecting! It was more like a park than a Botanical Garden, but I suppose that I visited at the wrong time of year to appreciate the plants. There were a lot of families visiting, and as it was a sunny day, it was very busy. Easy to get",
          "Very near to the city, grat to spend time with all the family!",

        "wiki": "Basel ( BAH-z\u0259l, German: [\u02c8ba\u02d0zl\u0329] (listen)) or Basle ( BAHL; French: B\u00e2le [b\u0251l]; Italian: Basilea [bazi\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0a]; Romansh: Basilea [bazi\u02c8le\u02d0a] (listen)) is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva) with about 180,000 inhabitants. The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.\nThe city is known for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen). The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.\nThe city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva. In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one-third of the national product.Basel has been the seat of a Prince-Bishopric since the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.\nIn 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThere are traces of a settlement at the nearby Rhine knee from the early La T\u00e8ne period (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the Raurici at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik(to the northwest of the Old City, and likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum that was mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana). The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an oppidum on the site of Basel Minster, probably in reaction to the Roman invasion of Gaul.\nIn Roman Gaul, Augusta Raurica was established some 20 km (12 mi) from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a castra (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum formed by Diocletian.\nThe Germanic confederation of the Alemanni attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the Battle of Solicinium (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today Alsace and a large part of the Swiss Plateau. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.\nThe Duchy of Alemannia fell under Frankish rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but it passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.\nThe city was plundered and destroyed by a Magyar invasion in 917. The rebuilt city became part of Upper Burgundy, and as such was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.\n\n\n=== Prince-Bishopric of Basel ===\n\nFrom the donation by Rudolph III of Burgundy of the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II of Metz in 999 until the Reformation, Basel was ruled by Prince-Bishops (see Bishop of Basel, whose memory is preserved in the crosier shown on the Basel coat of arms \u2013 see above).\nIn 1019, the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the M\u00fcnster) began under Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1225\u20131226, a bridge, now known as the Middle Bridge, was constructed by Bishop Heinrich von Thun and Lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river \"between Lake Constance and the sea\".\nThe Bishop also allowed the furriers to establish a guild in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market. The Crusade of 1267 set out from Basel.\nThe plague came to Europe in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible\u2014several had been tortured and confessed\u2014demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the Basel massacre, 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors \u2013 young orphans \u2013 were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the Basel earthquake of 1356 which destroyed much of the city along with a number of castles in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.\n\nIn 1412 (or earlier), the well-known Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), including the 1439 election of antipope Felix V. In 1459, Pope Pius II endowed the University of Basel, where such notables as Erasmus of Rotterdam and Paracelsus later taught. At the same time the new craft of printing was introduced to Basel by apprentices of Johann Gutenberg.\nThe Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. Johann Froben also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus. In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Imperial Diet. In 1500 the construction of the Basel M\u00fcnster was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.\n\n\n=== As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nThe city had remained neutral through the Swabian War of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The Treaty of Basel ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire.On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its eleventh canton. It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with Strasbourg and Mulhouse, and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.In 1503, the new bishop Christoph von Utenheim refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.In 1529, the city became Protestant under Oecolampadius and the bishop's seat was moved to Porrentruy. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the \"Daig\" played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a de facto city aristocracy.\nThe first edition of Christianae religionis institutio (Institutes of the Christian Religion \u2013 John Calvin's great exposition of Calvinist doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist David Joris.In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica, the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564).There are indications Joachim Meyer, author of the influential 16th-century martial arts text Kunst des Fechten (\"The Art of Fencing\"), came from Basel. In 1662 the Amerbaschsches Kabinett was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.\nThe Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as Jakob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli and Daniel Bernoulli, were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician Leonhard Euler was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nIn 1792, the Republic of Rauracia, a revolutionary French client republic, was created. It lasted until 1793. After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the Zoo Basel, opened its doors in the south of the city towards Binningen.\n\nIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nIn 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter Pablo Picasso which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.\n\n\n=== Basel as a historical, international meeting place ===\nBasel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from 29 August through 31 August 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the (Socialist) Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the Basel Convention was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym Basilia, which originally meant a public building and later a church. Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal Greek name Basilius. The Old French form Basle was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French B\u00e2le. The Icelandic name Buslaraborg goes back to the 12th century Lei\u00f0arv\u00edsir og borgarskipan chronicle.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLocated where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany. As of 2016, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018). The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007. Basel is the most densely populated city in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBasel has an area, as of 2009, of 23.91 square kilometers (9.23 sq mi). Of this area, 0.95 km2 (0.37 sq mi) or 4.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.88 km2 (0.34 sq mi) or 3.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.67 km2 (7.98 sq mi) or 86.4% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.45 km2 (0.56 sq mi) or 6.1% is either rivers or lakes.Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 10.2% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 40.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 24.0%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.7% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 8.9%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 2.5% is used for growing crops and 1.3% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen system, Basel features a continental-influenced oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), due to its relatively far inland position. The city averages 120.4 days of rain or snow annually and on average receives 842 mm (33.1 in) of precipitation. The wettest month is May during which time Basel receives an average of 99 mm (3.9 in) of rain. The month with the most days of precipitation is also May, with an average of 12.4 days.

In this case, a room is defined as space of a housing unit of at least 4 m2 (43 sq ft) as normal bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens and habitable cellars and attics. About 10.5% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement).\nAs of 2000, there were 86,371 private households in the municipality, and an average of 1.8 persons per household. There were 44,469 households that consist of only one person and 2,842 households with five or more people.

The vacancy rate for the municipality, in 2010, was 0.74%.\n\n\n==== Historical population ====\n\n\n=== Language ===\nMost of the population (as of 2000) speaks German (129,592 or 77.8%), with Italian being second most common (9,049 or 5.4%) and French being third (4,280 or 2.6%). There are 202 persons who speak Romansh.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nFrom the 2000 census, 41,916 or 25.2% were Roman Catholic, while 39,180 or 23.5% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. Of the rest of the population, there were 4,567 members of an Orthodox church (or about 2.74% of the population), there were 459 individuals (or about 0.28% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 3,464 individuals (or about 2.08% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church.

There were 1,325 individuals (or about 0.80% of the population) who were Jewish, however only members of religious institutions are counted as such by the municipality, which makes the actual number of people of Jewish descent living in Basel considerably higher. There were 746 individuals who were Buddhist, 947 individuals who were Hindu and 485 individuals who belonged to another church. 52,321 (or about 31.41% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 8,780 individuals (or about 5.27% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\nBasel is subdivided into 19 quarters (Quartiere). The municipalities of Riehen and Bettingen, outside the city limits of Basel, are included in the canton of Basel-Stadt as rural quarters (Landquartiere).\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBasel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of continental Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nBasel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the Rhine and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of Rotterdam.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to Schengen there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could \"emigrate\" to the other side of the airport.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nBasel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations\u2014those of the German, French and Swiss networks\u2014lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (B\u00e2le SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nBasel is located on the A3 motorway.\nWithin the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):\n\nSchwarzwaldbr\u00fccke (built 1972)\nWettsteinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)\nMittlere Rheinbr\u00fccke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)\nJohanniterbr\u00fccke (built 1967)\nDreirosenbr\u00fccke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nA somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of reaction ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 to 30 metres (66 to 98 feet). To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45\u00b0 from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.\n[1]\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nBasel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large tram network. The green-colored local trams and buses are operated by the Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the Baselland Transport (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in France and Baden region in Germany. The Basel Regional S-Bahn, the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by SBB, SNCF and DB.\n\n\n==== Border crossings ====\nBasel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the Jura Mountains, many within the Swiss military reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime. It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the European Union Customs Union (though it did join the EU Single Market) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.\n\nFrance-Switzerland (from east to west) \n\nRoad crossings (with French road name continuation)\nKohlenstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Huningue). This crossing replaces the former crossing H\u00fcningerstrasse further east.\nEls\u00e4sserstrasse (Avenue de B\u00e2le, Saint-Louis)\nAutobahn A3 (A35 autoroute, Saint-Louis)\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg \u2013 pedestrian walkway between the French and Swiss sections on Level 3 (departures) of airport.\nBurgfelderstrasse (Rue du 1er Mars, Saint Louis)\nRailway crossing\nBasel SBB railway stationGermany-Switzerland (clockwise, from north to south)\n\nRoad crossings (with German road name continuation)\nHiltalingerstrasse (Zollstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein). Tram 8 goes along this road to Weil am Rhein. The extension opened in 2014; it used to end before the border.\nAutobahn A2 (Autobahn A5, Weil am Rhein)\nFreiburgerstrasse (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nWeilstrasse, Riehen (Haupstra\u00dfe, Weil am Rhein)\nL\u00f6rracherstrasse, Riehen (Baslerstra\u00dfe, Stetten, L\u00f6rrach)\nInzlingerstrasse, Riehen (Riehenstra\u00dfe, Inzlingen)\nGrenzacherstrasse (H\u00f6rnle, Grenzach-Wyhlen)\nRailway crossing\nBetween Basel SBB and Basel Badischer Bahnhof \u2013 Basel Badischer Bahnhof, and all other railway property and stations on the right bank of the Rhine belong to DB and are classed as German customs territory. Immigration and customs checks are conducted at the platform exit tunnel for passengers leaving trains here.Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAs the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the Universit\u00e4tsspital Basel and the Universit\u00e4tskinderspital Basel. The anthroposophical health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute is located in Basel too.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\nBasel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve energy use in Switzerland by 2050. To research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a 2000 Watt society, a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to Minergie or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas.\nA building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.A hot dry rock geothermal energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced seismicity in Basel.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called Dreil\u00e4ndereck) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.\nAs of 2016, Basel had an unemployment rate of 3.7%. As of 2008, there were 18 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 9 businesses involved in this sector. 34,645 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,176 businesses in this sector. 120,130 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 8,908 businesses in this sector.

About 23.9% of the workforce coming into Basel are coming from outside Switzerland, while 1.0% of the locals commute out of Switzerland for work. Of the working population, 49.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 18.7% used a private car.\n\nThe Roche Tower, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, is 41 floors and 178 metres (584 ft) high, upon its opening in 2015 it has become the tallest building in Switzerland. Basel has also Switzerland's third tallest building (Basler Messeturm, 105 m (344 ft)) and Switzerland's tallest tower (St. Chrischona TV tower, 250 m (820 ft)).\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nThe Swiss chemical industry operates largely from Basel, and Basel also has a large pharmaceutical industry. Novartis, Syngenta, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basilea Pharmaceutica and Actelion are headquartered there. Pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals have become the modern focus of the city's industrial production.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nBanking is important to Basel:\n\nUBS AG maintains central offices in Basel,\nThe Bank for International Settlements is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a board of directors, which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).According to the BIS, \"The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.\"\nCreated in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member central banks, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank. The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's commercial banking system.Basel is also the location of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the Basel Accords (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III), this organization fundamentally changed Risk management within its industry.\nBasel also hosts the headquarters of the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).\n\n\n=== Air ===\nSwiss International Air Lines, the national airline of Switzerland, is headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel. Prior to the formation of Swiss International Air Lines, the regional airline Crossair was headquartered near Basel.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nBasler Zeitung (\"BaZ\") and bz Basel are the local newspapers. The local TV station is called Telebasel. The German-speaking Swiss Radio and Television SRF company, part of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR, holds offices in Basel as well. The academic publishers Birkh\u00e4user, Karger and MDPI are based in Basel.\n\n\n=== Trade fairs ===\nImportant trade shows include Art Basel, the world's most important fair for modern and contemporary art, Baselworld (watches and jewelry), Swissbau (construction and real estate) and Igeho (hotels, catering, take-away, care). The Swiss Sample Fair (\"Schweizer Mustermesse\") was the largest and oldest consumer fair in Switzerland. It was held from 2007 to 2019 and took place in Kleinbasel on the right bank of the Rhine.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBesides Humanism the city of Basel has also always been very famous for its achievement in the field of mathematics. Among others, the mathematician Leonhard Euler and the Bernoulli family have done research and been teaching at the local institutions for centuries. In 1910 the Swiss Mathematical Society was founded in the city and in the mid-twentieth century the Russian mathematician Alexander Ostrowski taught at the local university. \nIn 2000 about 57,864 or (34.7%) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 27,603 or (16.6%) have completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule).

A memorial to Erasmus lies inside the M\u00fcnster. The City Hall from the 16th century is located on the Market Square and is decorated with fine murals on the outer walls and on the walls of the inner court.\n\nBasel is also host to an array of buildings by internationally renowned architects.

It is also the home of the Basel Sinfonietta and the Kammerorchester Basel, which recorded the complete symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven for the Sony label, led by its music director Giovanni Antonini. The Schola Cantorum and the Basler Kammerorchester were both founded by the conductor Paul Sacher, who went on to commission works by many leading composers.

They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence in Europa. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.\n\nAntikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig Ancient cultures of the mediterranean museum\nAugusta Raurica Roman open-air museum\nBasel Paper Mill (German: Basler Papierm\u00fchle)\nBeyeler Foundation (Foundation Beyeler) Beyeler Museum (Fondation Beyeler)\nBotanical Garden Basel One of the oldest botanical gardens in the world\nCaricature & Cartoon Museum Basel (German: Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel)\nDollhouse Museum (German: Puppenhausmuseum) a museum housing the largest teddy bear collection in Europe.\nFoundation Fernet Branca (French: Fondation Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin near Basel.

One of the most important fairs for contemporary art worldwide is the Art Basel which was founded in 1970 by Ernst Beyeler and takes place in June each year. Baselworld, the watch and jewellery show (Uhren- und Schmuckmesse) one of the biggest fairs of its kind in Europe is held every year as well, and attracts a great number of tourists and dealers to the city. Live marketing company and fair organizer MCH Group has its head office in Basel.\n\nThe carnival of the city of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (Morgestraich) on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.\nBasel Tattoo, founded in 2006 by the local Top Secret Drum Corps, has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. The Basel Tattoo annual parade, with an estimated 125,000 visitors, is considered the largest event in Basel. The event is now sponsored by the Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS), making it the official military tattoo of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThere are a number of culinary specialties originating in Basel, including Basler L\u00e4ckerli cookies and M\u00e4ssmogge candies. Being located in the meeting place between Switzerland, France and Germany the culinary landscape as a whole is very varied and diverse, making it a city with a great number of restaurants of all sorts.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nZoo Basel is, with over 1.7 million visitors per year, the most visited tourist attraction in Basel and the second most visited tourist attraction in Switzerland.Established in 1874, Zoo Basel is the oldest zoo in Switzerland and, by number of animals, the largest. Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide Indian rhinoceros birth and Greater flamingo hatch in a zoo. These and other achievements led Forbes Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call \"their\" zoo \"Zolli\" by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nBasel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The football club FC Basel continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the 2008 European Championships, as well as Geneva, Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The championships were jointly hosted by Switzerland and Austria. BSC Old Boys and Concordia Basel are the other football teams in Basel.\nAmong the most popular sports in Switzerland is ice hockey. Basel is home to the EHC Basel which plays in the MySports League, the third tier of the Swiss ice hockey league system. They play their home games in the 6,700-seat St. Jakob Arena. The team previously played in the National League and the Swiss League, but they had to fill a bankruptcy case after the 2013\u201314 Swiss League season.\nBasel features a large football stadium that has been awarded four stars by UEFA, a modern ice hockey hall, and an admitted sports hall.\n\nA large indoor tennis event takes place in Basel every October. Some of the best ATP-professionals play every year at the Swiss Indoors, including Switzerland's biggest sporting hero and frequent participant Roger Federer, a Basel native who describes the city as \"one of the most beautiful cities in the world\".\nThe annual Basel Rhine Swim draws several thousand visitors to the city to swim in or float on the Rhine river.While football and ice hockey are by far the most popular sports, basketball has a very small but faithful fan base. The top division, called SBL, is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the \"Birstal Starwings\".\nTwo players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. \nAs in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system. The Starwings Basel are the only first division basketball team in German-speaking Switzerland.IHF (International Handball Federation) is here.\nBasel Dragons AFC have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n1975 DJ Antoine (real name Antoine Konrad), Swiss DJ producer\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial tourism site\nBasel Cityguide\nEuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\nOverview of museums in Basel or basel museums\nPortrait of Basel's tramways\nWebsite of the regional television of Basel \u2013 Enjoy daily news and stories about Baselcity, Baselland and the green Fricktal and Laufental, together with its citizens",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Goetheanum, located  in Dornach, in the canton of Solothurn, Switzerland, is the world center for the anthroposophical movement.\nThe building was designed by Rudolf Steiner and named after Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. It includes two performance halls (1500 seats), gallery and lecture spaces, a library, a bookstore, and administrative spaces for the Anthroposophical Society; neighboring buildings house the society's research and educational facilities. Conferences focusing on themes of general interest or directed toward teachers, farmers, doctors, therapists, and other professionals are held at the center throughout the year.\nBoth the present Goetheanum building and its precursor have been widely cited as masterpieces of modern architecture.The Goetheanum is open for visitors seven days a week and offers tours several times daily.\n\n\n== First Goetheanum ==\n\nThe First Goetheanum, a timber and concrete structure designed by Rudolf Steiner, was one of seventeen buildings Steiner designed between 1908 and 1925. It was intended as a Gesamtkunstwerk (the synthesis of diverse artistic media and sensory effects), infused with spiritual significance. Begun in 1913 to house the annual summer theater events of the Anthroposophical Society, it rapidly became the center of a small colony of spiritual seekers located in Dornach and based around Steiner.  Numerous visual artists contributed to the building: architects created the unusual double-dome wooden structure over a curving concrete base, stained glass windows added color into the space, painters decorated the ceiling with motifs depicting the whole of human evolution, and sculptors carved huge column bases, capitals, and architraves with images of metamorphoses.Already during the construction, musicians, actors, and movement artists began performing a wide variety of pieces in a neighboring workshop. When the Goetheanum hall was completed, in 1919, these performances moved onto the stage located under the Goetheanum's smaller cupola. The auditorium was located under the larger cupola. The building was opened on September 26, 1920.This building was destroyed by fire on New Year's Eve, December 31, 1922 \u2013 January 1, 1923, and some claim by arson, but that is not proven.\n\n\n== Second Goetheanum ==\n\nIn the course of 1923, Steiner designed a building to replace the original. This building, now known as the Second Goetheanum, was built wholly of cast concrete. Begun in 1924, the building was not completed until 1928, after the architect's death. It represents a pioneering use of visible concrete in architecture  and has been granted protected status as a Swiss national monument. Art critic Michael Brennan has called the building a \"true masterpiece of 20th-century expressionist architecture\".The present Goetheanum houses a 1000-seat auditorium, now the center of an active artistic community incorporating performances of its in-house theater and eurythmy troupes as well as visiting performers from around the world. Full remodelings of the central auditorium took place in the mid-1950s and again in the late 1990s. The stained glass windows in the present building date from Steiner's time; the painted ceiling and sculptural columns are contemporary replications or reinterpretations of those in the First Goetheanum.\nIn a dedicated gallery, the building also houses a nine-meter-high wooden sculpture, The Representative of Humanity, by Edith Maryon and Rudolf Steiner.\n\n\n== Architectural principles ==\nSteiner's architecture is characterized by a liberation from traditional architectural constraints, especially through the departure from the right-angle as a basis for the building plan. For the first Goetheanum he achieved this in wood by employing boat builders to construct its rounded forms; for the second Goetheanum by using concrete to achieve sculptural shapes on an architectural scale. The use of concrete to achieve organically expressive forms was an innovation for the times; in both buildings, Steiner sought to create forms that were spiritually expressive.Steiner suggested that he had derived the sculptural forms of the first Goetheanum from spiritual inspirations.\n\n\n=== Additional buildings ===\nSteiner designed approximately 12-13 other built structures, including both institutional structures and residences in and around Dornach. Steiner is one of very few major architects  who was never the pupil of another major architect.Architects who have visited and praised the Goetheanum's architecture include Henry van de Velde, Frank Lloyd Wright, Hans Scharoun, and Frank Gehry.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nGoetheanum 3D VRML Models by Horst Kiechle\nThe First Goetheanum at the Great buildings online website\nArchitecture Section at the Rudolf Steiner Archive, An Online Library\nArchitecture and Anthroposophy.

Its cathedral chapter seat, bishop's residence and cathedral (1681 / 1761) are listed as a heritage site of national significance.The official language of Arlesheim is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, while the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.\nThe cathedral has a Baroque organ built by the German builder Johann Andreas Silbermann, based in Alsace, in 1761. The instrument was restored by Metzler in 1959\u20131962, and is an example of the fusion of French and German organ building styles. It has been used in several recordings, including Lionel Rogg's recording of the complete organ works of J. S. Bach, for Harmonia Mundi France in 1970.\n\n\n== History ==\nArlesheim is first mentioned in 708. In 1239 it was mentioned as Arlisheim.\n\n\n=== Prehistoric settlements ===\nThe protected location on the western foot of the Gempen Plateau encouraged early settlement of the area. Paleolithic Magdalenian culture items from around 10,000 BC were discovered in the Birseck\u2013Ermitage and Hollenberg 3 caves. Birseck\u2013Ermitage was discovered in 1910 by Fritz Sartorius-Preiswerk, and Hollenberg 3 was discovered in 1950 by Martin Herkert. The caves contained traces of fires, spear points carved from reindeer antler, and pendants made from snail and mussel shells. From the end of the Palaeolithic era, Birseck\u2013Ermitage cave contains galets colori, red-stripe-like painted limestone pebbles, and flint tools.  From the Mesolithic period (c.6000\u20135000 BC), flint tools have been discovered at the Abri overhang at Hohlefels, excavated in 1905 by Fritz Sarasin, and in the Birseck\u2013Hermitage cave. Some funerary objects from the largely unexplored transitional period between the Mesolithic to Neolithic period (around 5200 BC) were also discovered. Several Neolithic ax blades were discovered across the municipal area, with a concentration at Dachsenh\u00f6hle and Kleinen H\u00f6hle am Hohlefels that were excavated in 1952\u20131954 by Martin Herkert, Bernhard Hesse, and Andreas Schwabe. In the Kleinen H\u00f6hle, skeletal remains of children with grave goods as well as a typological flint spear points were also found. Horgen culture (around 3000 BC) ceramic vessels have also been found. From the Bronze Age, only a few, mostly generic items have been discovered. So far, no items from the Iron Age have been found.\n\n\n=== Medieval settlement ===\nThe farm complex of Arlesheim was owned by Mont Sainte-Odile Monastery in Alsace starting in the 8th century. It was sold in 1239 to the Bishop of Basel L\u00fcthold von R\u00f6tteln. In 1245 the Frohburg family withdrew their claims on the land, which left the Bishop with an uncontested title to the land. In 1273 he pledged the village to the Lords of Ramstein in exchange for a loan. The Bishops of Basel did not get the village back until 1435. After that Arlesheim belonged to the Bishop's Herrschaft of Birseck.The inhabitants were initially part of the parish of Pfeffingen. However, by 1341 they possessed a parish church and by 1396 their own pastor. This parish church, the church of St. Odilia, was rebuilt in the late 17th century and demolished in 1816.\n\n\n=== The Reformation to the Early Modern Period ===\nWhile Arlesheim was probably under the influence of Basel through the counts of Birseck, it never entered into a Burgrecht treaty with the city.  Despite Arlesheim's loose connection with Basel, it converted to the new Protestant faith in 1528 when Basel converted. About half a century later, in 1582, the Bishop of Basel, Jakob Christoph Blarer von Wartensee, succeeded in spreading the Counter-Reformation in Arlesheim.In the Thirty Years War the surrounding countryside was damaged by looting and pillaging. Arlesheim, however, was off the main roads and was relatively untouched. It had developed as a small, rather out of the way wine-growing village with the Bishop's estates and wine-press. As a result, when the Basel cathedral council and priests moved from Freiburg im Breisgau in 1678, they went to Arlesheim. An administrative center and impressive early baroque residences were built in the town. Under the same artistic concept, and initially led by Franz Demess, the cathedral was built in 1679\u20131681. This was followed by the magnificent Domherrenh\u00e4user which was built between 1680\u20131687. These new buildings made Arlesheim an attractive place for nobles, high clergy, diplomats, artists, and craftsmen. The court life of the canons also promoted indigenous craftsmen.  In 1726 a mint opened in town. Then, in 1763 the seat of the Bailiwick of Birseck moved from Birseck Castle to the Andlauer Hof in Arlesheim. In 1785 Balbina von Andlau and Canon Heinrich von Ligerz created the  Eremitage (Hermitage), the largest English garden in Switzerland, which was known throughout Europe and attracted many travelers.The right to appoint Arlesheim's pastor was held by the Bishop of Basel until 1678, after which it went to the council of Basel's Cathedral. At the beginning of the 17th century the parish of Arlesheim was briefly united briefly with the parish of Reinach (in Basel-Country) into a single parish.\n\n\n=== French Revolution to Modern Arlesheim ===\n\nAfter the short-lived Rauracian Republic (1792\u201393), the village was under French rule from 1793 to 1814. Between 1793 and 1800 it was part of the D\u00e9partement of Mont-Terrible and then in 1800\u20131814 it was part of the D\u00e9partement of Haut-Rhin. Under the revolutionary forces, the Cathedral and the Domherrenh\u00e4user were nationalized. Courageous citizens bought the cathedral and prevented it from being demolished. Later, the parish acquired the building and the cathedral became a parish church. In 1814-1815, it was the seat of the coalition Governor General of the diocese of Basel. In 1815 the Canton of Basel was recreated. Arlesheim was part of the Canton of Basel until it split into two half-cantons in 1832. Arlesheim joined Basel-Country and became the capital of a district.During the invasion of revolutionary France, the cathedral canons fled the city. The flight of the canons led to an economic depression in the village in the years following the French invasion. In 1830 Johann Siegmund Alioth moved from Basel to Arlesheim and set up the first mechanical silk-factory in Switzerland along the Birs. The factory operated for nearly a century and a half, until it closed in 1976. For his Reformed workers, Daniel August Alioth built a Reformed chapel in his garden in 1856. This Reformed church served the needs of just a few Reformed families throughout the entire Birseck. A Reformed parish was established in 1882 in Arlesheim.In 1875 the Jura\u2013Simplon Railway opened a line into Arlesheim, which was followed in 1902 by the Birseckbahn Basel-Arlesheim-Dornach tram line. In 1976 it was purchased by Baselland Transport. These two train lines gave further impetus to the industrial and service sectors including the Alioth electric equipment supply company in 1892, the anthroposophist Ita Wegman Clinic in 1921, and the Weleda remedies company.\nArlesheim has a mild climate and sunny vineyards, which made it a popular location for vacation villas. In 1880 the first housing estate was built in New-Arlesheim. The many workers who moved into Arlesheim fostered a sectarian shift in what was once a very Catholic village. The construction of the Reformed church in 1911\u20131912 encouraged more Reformed workers to follow. In 1990 about 41% of the population was Catholic, while 38% were Reformed. After 1960 Arlesheim developed into a residential community for the agglomeration of Basel. In 1990 over two-thirds of the workers were commuters, and 77% of the jobs were in the services sector. The ensuing infrastructure problems, including overbuilding, led to a town planning ordinance of 1971 and redevelopment of the village square in 1987 and 1991.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nArlesheim has an area, as of 2009, of 6.93 square kilometers (2.68 sq mi). Of this area, 0.65 km2 (0.25 sq mi) or 9.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while 3.64 km2 (1.41 sq mi) or 52.5% is forested.

        "wiki": "The Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re (French: Basilique Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re) is a minor basilica in Lyon. It was built with private funds between 1872 and 1884 in a dominant position overlooking the city. The site it occupies was once the Roman forum of Trajan, the forum vetus (old forum), thus its name (as an inverted corruption of the French Vieux-Forum).\n\n\n== Role in the history and life of the city ==\n\nFourvi\u00e8re is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, to whom is attributed the salvation of the city of Lyon from the bubonic plague that swept Europe in 1643. Each year in early December (December 8, day of the Immaculate Conception), Lyon thanks the Virgin for saving the city by lighting candles throughout the city, in what is called the F\u00eate des Lumi\u00e8res or the Festival of Lights. The Virgin is also credited with saving the city a number of other times, such as from a Cholera epidemic in 1832, and from Prussian invasion in 1870.During the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u20131), Prussian forces, having taken Paris, were progressing south towards Lyon. Their halt and retreat were, once again, attributed by the Church to the intercession of the Virgin Mary.\nSpeculating on the reasons for the construction of such an elaborate and expensive building, one author makes the statement that: \"The reaction to the communes of Paris and Lyon were triumphalist monuments, the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur of Montmartre and the basilica of Fourvi\u00e8re, dominating both cities. These buildings were erected with private funds, as gigantic ex-votos, to thank God for victory over the socialists and in expiation of the sins of modern France.\"Perched on top of the Fourvi\u00e8re hill, the basilica looms impressively over the city of Lyon, from where it can be seen from many vantage points; not unintentionally, the Basilica of Fourvi\u00e8re has become a symbol of the city. \nThe Basilica, which offers guided tours and contains a Museum of Sacred Art, receives 2 million visitors annually. At certain times, members of the public may access the basilica's north tower for a spectacular 180-degree view of Lyon and its suburbs. On a clear day, Mont Blanc, the highest point in Europe, can be seen in the distance.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\nThe design of the basilica, by Pierre Bossan, draws from both Romanesque and Byzantine architecture, two non-Gothic models that were unusual choices at the time. It has four main towers, and a belltower topped with a gilded statue of the Virgin Mary. It features fine mosaics, superb stained glass, and a crypt of Saint Joseph.\nFourvi\u00e8re actually contains two churches, one on top of the other. The upper sanctuary is very ornate, while the lower is a much simpler design. Work on the triumphant basilica was begun in 1872 and finished in 1884. Finishing touches in the interior were not completed until as late as 1964.\nBossan's first sketches for the basilica seem to date from 1846. At the time he was in Palermo.The basilica has acquired the local nickname of \"the upside-down elephant\", because the building looks like the body of an elephant and the four towers look like its legs.\n\n\n== The Choir of the Basilica ==\nLes Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc, The Children's Choir of Saint Mark, is the official choir of the Basilica.\nThis choir become well known after the release of the film Les Choristes.\nThe choir's Director is Monsieur Nicolas Porte.\n\n\n== Radio antennas ==\nSince 1982 the tower has housed the antennas of Radio Fourvi\u00e8re, the predecessor of Radios chr\u00e9tiennes francophones.\n\n\n== Shrine of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re ==\n\nFourvi\u00e8re has always been a popular place of pilgrimage. There has been a shrine at Fourvi\u00e8re dedicated to Our Lady since 1170. The chapel and parts of the building have been rebuilt at different times over the centuries, the most recent major works being in 1852 when the former steeple was replaced by a tower surmounted by a golden statue of the Virgin Mary sculpted by Joseph-Hugues Fabisch (1812\u20131886).On 23 July 1816 twelve Marist aspirants, priests and seminarians, climbed the hill to the shrine of Our Lady of Fourvi\u00e8re and placed their promise to found the Society of Mary (Marists) under the corporal on the altar while Jean-Claude Courveille celebrated Mass.On 21 January 1851, Peter Julian Eymard prayed at the Shrine of Our Lady of Fourvi\u00e8re and was inspired to found the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament.When the city of Lyon was spared in the Franco-Prussian War (1870), the community committed to build the present Basilica alongside the ancient chapel.\n\n\n== See also ==\nParc des Hauteurs\nThree hares \u2013 an architectural icon and religious symbol used in the basilica.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\nCredited for architectural work within the monumental edifice is Louis Jean Perrin the father-in-law of Paul Claudel (\u26ad Reine Sainte-Marie Perrin, 1906). Bossan was his p\u00e8re nourricier (adoptive father).\n\n\n== External links ==\nPicture of Statue atop the Chapelle de la Vierge\nBasilica Notre Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re Website",

          "It's a beautiful cathedral, both outside and inside. The cathedral stays on the famous Fourvi\u00e8re hill and has extra lighting in the night. It was built around 1872-1884 and has lots of history considering that Fourviere is the site of the original Roman settlement. We took a",
          "I liked the visit of this basilica, rich in history, beautiful decoration and pretty centenary trees",
          "This basilica is amazing... it is a must to go to the top of the roof to enjoy the view of Lyon.... we need to pay extra money here. The interior of basilica is impressive as well. The effort to go up is definitely worthy.",
          "I would most certainly make a visit to this Cathedral in conjunction with the Gallo-Roman Museum and Amphitheater. It is about a 4 minute walk from these sites. Inside is stunning.",
          "It is a privilege to visit this Basilique that offers a unique bird view of Lyon. Built during the late 19th century on a former roman spot, the Basilique turns this historical legacy into a fantastic mixture of the most diverse neos: it is neo-baroque, neo-gothic,",
          "This has got to be one of the most beautiful cathedrals I have ever been too. So much detail everywhere. I absolutely loved it.",

          "We enjoyed this church. It was lovely and is a must see if going to lyon. The view over the city is awesome. I would also recommend their gift shop if you enjoy religious icons it had a great selection. I would recommend taking an uber from main part of town it was quite",
          "Okay so we did not get to go inside because our timing was off, but this place is stunning to look at from the outside. Even better at night if you are sitting across the river at one of the cute little restaurants and look up and over to see the basilica lit up. It is gorgeous.",
          "This place gives you a view of Lyon from the top. The Basilique is rather small, but it's a warm and quiet place (compared to sacr\u00e9-c\u0153ur for example). There are free translations of Bible in many languages, the priest is really friendly, and the church has a clam atmosphere.",
          "The Basilique was worth the walk up the hill. If you can\u2019t there\u2019s a funicular. Lots of tourists but still worth the climb. Light a candle and say a prayer for the good or needy.",
          "A magnificent Basilica overlooking Lyon. An amazing interior and lower church with beautiful stained glass and statues throughout. You must see the view of Lyon from the viewing point. The building is lit up at night and makes a beautiful picture from the Cathedral Square.",

          "The detail outside is absolutely amazing. Acanthus leaves, lilies and statues. Inside takes your breath away - just beautiful. I didn\u2019t realise there was a crypt though - I wish I\u2019d seen it - my friends found it but I\u2019d gone back outside.",
          "Don\u2019t be tempted to write this off as just another church and not go inside (some people we met outside were planning to do just that). The interior is stunning and a must see",
          "Beautiful scenery Great church that was visited by the pope Interisting chapels inside and a very nice walk down to the VIEUX LYON part in lyon",
          "Whilst the outside is impressive it's the inside of this beautiful church that is the real attraction. Amazing mosaics, roof, windows - it has the lot. Unmissable if you are in Lyon. The funicular is a great way to get up the hill, and you can take the stairs back down whilst",
          "Stunning! Really beautiful place with long history. Also the view from the top is really pretty. I think it is a must visit.",
          "Magnificent crypts and grandeur interiors highlight the rich past of the Lyon. Noteworthy are the idols of Mother from various parts of world including one from India! And not to miss the breathtaking view of Lyon city from the hill !",
          "This church is right up there with some of the best. Amazing interior, free entry and handy little gift shop next door for those inclined to help out the pope. We spent some time in both the crypt and the main church and loved every moment.",
          "I have been to many cathedrals all over the world and this is one of my favourite. Looking at the amazing sculptures and artwork one wonder how talented the artists where in those times. In the modern era we rely so heavily on computer generated images. These artists had no such",
          "We were in Paris in October, and were heartbroken to see the burned remnants of Notre Dame, so it was with delight that we ventured through the Basilique Notre Dame de Fourviere. The tilework is just amazing, and the sanctuary beautiful.",
          "One of the better interiors in a church we have seen in Europe. Fantastic views of the city from the hill top",
          "Mosaics were incredible and the view of the city just behind was well worth the trip up. You can easily go from there to the Roman ruins.",
          "This site is a must see when in Lyon, it\u2019s gorgeous!! You can either hike up the hill or take the tram up which is 3 euros round trip per person, either way you will be rewarded with incredible views of the city and can tour this beautiful Basilique.",

          "The church is jaw dropping beautiful - floor to ceiling beautiful. The altar is amazing, the mosaics on the wall are amazing, the floor patterns are amazing and the ceiling is amazing. Then when you walk down to the crypt you find another amazing church with numerous Mary",
          "The current Basilique Notre Dame de Fourviere dates from the 19th century and, while undoubtedly impressive, suffers from an overload of ornamentation. However, the views from the beside the cathedral over Lyon are truly breathtaking.",
          "If you want to see fieworks for the 14th of July (national day : public holiday), the 1st January or for the festival of Light, you've to go there. The view is perfect in Lyon. You can by clear weather see the Blanc Mount. Don't forget to visit the roman amphitheater",
          "One of the top 5 to do in Lyon. It took us about 15 minutes walk from the bottom of Lyon (winter time)...thin side of the basilique is uniquely decorated with mosaic fresques. There is as much to see above that on the lower level. Highly recommended..",
          "Accessed this by the Venicular Railway and once at the top, got amazing views over the city. Inside the Cathedral, it was stunning and peaceful.",
          "One word, magnificent!!! Not just the buildings or the stained glass or mosaic but also the general feeling. A 'must visit' if in Lyon.",
          "No comparison to THE Notre Dame in Paris but still a place very worth visiting. It sits at the highest point of the old Lyon. There are several different routes to go up, some are more difficult than others, so, pick your route carefully.",
          "We went during the light festival, so it was magical. But other than that the church is worth seeing with its eclectic architectural style and the mosaics. Also the view is wonderful, especially at night.",
          "Very impressive and well decorated holly place. We liked very much all the windowing and the paints on the walls.",
          "Well worth a visit, take the funicular up and it is opposite the station entrance. A good view from the hill and about 3 minutes walk from the church is a roman amphitheatre. Your funicular ticket 3\u20ac is a return ticket.",
          "On the top of the hill, has the most amazing view of Lyon. Huge and well preserved basilica. Great glass work and architecture.",
          "After you've seen the fine arts museum you need to visit this beautiful cathedral, which you can see from anywhere in the city. Don't even think about walking up to it though. Take the funicular, a small train that climbs the nearly vertical hill. Get your ticket from a vending",
          "I've visited churches and cathedrals in many countries, and I have to say that the interior of this basilica is the most impressive that I've seen - truly awe-inspiring. There is also a wonderful view outside over the whole city of Lyon, and on a clear day you can see the Alps",
          "Beautiful interior, stunning views from the basilica. The crypt is just as large as the the church above.",
          "Though we don't have enough time to come in and pray, we take 20 minutes walking around and immersed in the beauty of the basilica",
          "This basilica is amazing inside, better than the Sacre Coeur, IMHO. The walls outside surrounding the entrance are SO ornate and the interior is covered with absolutely gorgeous gilded mosaics. I was overcome with awe at the interior. I think it was one of the most beautiful",
          "I am not a fan of churches and the only reason I have visited this place is the view and it's worth visiting. If you are interested in churches, don't miss this place.",
          "The Basilica of Fourviere is situated above Lyon. The view is outstanding. The interior is ornate. It is worth the visit.",
          "Beautiful basilica and there is a view of Lyon from here. Nice to walk around. They have souvenir shops beside and benches to sit to relax on a beautiful day",
          "The church looks spectacular from the outside, and inside it is a riot of 'Victorian' decorative art. The views over Lyon from the esplanade next to the church are spectacular!",
          "Well worth the hike to the top of the hill to see the Roman ruins and Bascillica of Notre Dame in Lyon.",
          "This is a good place to spend part of an afternoon. Hike up the hill and enjoy the views and work up your appetite for some of the places in Vieux Lyon",
          "We were lucky enough to visit whilst mass was being said. This was very enjoyable and church decor is stunning. The views from this point are fantastic. Would recommend getting tram up and walkingback down through gardens.",
          "Visit at night! It's absolutely breathtaking. Pro tip: take the funicular up and explore before heading to the Roman Theatre. You can grab the funicular down again.",
          "It's a very easy funicular ride from Vieux Lyon and the perfect resting spot on a hustling and bustling Saturday. Both beautiful and meaningful. The view of Lyon alone is worth the visit. Free admission and a self-guided is just fine.",
          "Not only the views over Lyon are great, but also walking that hill make a good experience. If you get there also go inside the basiliqueand in the underground where you can find a projector showing the history of the place.",
          "This is beautifully located on top of a hill overlooking the city with great views. The external architecture is wonderful. Inside it is amazing with some wonderful windows and mosaics. It is stunning. The funicular was not running to Fourvi\u00e8re so we got the one to St Just and",
          "It is a good walk up that is rewarded by magnificent views of the city and a very beautiful cathedral. We were lucky to see the city at night with no rain. There was an ongoing exposition of the Blessed Sscrament inside the church. But it was an exhausting workout. Haha!",
          "This place is fantastic. It looks great in the day and at night when it is illuminated. Inside there are beautiful stained glass windows and lights, the biggest crypt ever, and amazing views over Lyon from outside.",
          "We visited the Basilique twice - once at night time and once during the day. On our first visit at night there was a service in process and photos were prohibited (which was appropriate). When we returned the following day we were able to take many photographs. A beautiful",
          "As part of a coach tour from Riviera's ms William Shakespeare we visited Fourviere Hill and the Basilica, which is well worth a visit, as well as giving us wonderful views from the hilltop overlooking old Lyon. One doesn't have to be a Christian to admire the wall frescos and,in",
          "Fortunate to be hear when a mass was in and the acoustics were just wonderful.have consisted a lot of churches in our travels but this one will stand out.beautiful building and surprising two floors.well with a visit.",
          "We visited Fourviere Hill and Notre Dame cathedral. The church was built in the 1800s It was nice, but not really memorable. Worth a stop if you are in Lyon and already took the funicular up to the top of the hill.",
          "We had a Mediocre experience here because there was ongoing construction and upgrade probably. The direction sign were confusing and there was the rain.",
          "Right on top of fourviere hill, you can take the funicular to get here easily. This church is very impressive, looking down on the rest of the city. Well worth a trip.",
          "I have always been facinated by religious architecture and this did not disappoint. Very prominently dominating the city with a remarkable view of the size of the whole of Lyon, even on another dull grey day, very much worth the visit, on this occasion, the only downside to the",
          "It deserves to be seen. My wife and I found the crypt very interesting depicting the various nationality virgin Marys ( Africa, Mali ...)",

          "Go up by funicular and then walk downhill. The view from Lyon and the presqu'ile is fantastic. There is also a small picnic area.",
          "Towering over the old city this basilica is worth taking time to visit Take the funicular up from by the old cathedral and then it\u2019s about ten to fifteen minutes walk",
          "This basilica is one of the great masterpieces of European Christianity. Superb architecture, wonderful interior decorations yet not overpowering. THE one thing to see in Lyon, despite the 15-20 min climb. The city panorama on a sunny day is superb as well. Well worth the visit.",
          "This is a must see in Lyon! You would be missing out on 2 fabulous experiences if you forgo, the Basilica and the view! We decided we needed a little exercise so decided to walk up but were nervous because everyone thought we were crazy, most either take the funicular, taxi or",
          "Wonderful basilica that sits above the city of Lyon. Couple of quick points. My wife and I did not visit the crypts. We also passed on the funicular and walked up from the main city area. This is about a 15-20 minute trek with some very steep hills. You are on sidewalks and",
          "Worth the climb up the steep lanes to the top od the hill. Go past the Roman ruins, also worth a look. The Badilica is beautiful inside and out. The views from the side were amazing.",

          "I had a chance to join the Sunday service in this basilica when they also commemorate 174th anniversary of Battle of Sidi Brahim. It was very serene, but since I don't speak the language, so yeah...a little bit lost in translation. On the right side of the basilica, there's a",

          "One of the lovliest churches we've ever seen. Amazing mozaics telling various biblical and christian stories. The crypt is beautiful and singular in that there is a Joseph and the Christ child statue on it not the usual Madona. Easily reached via the funicular (free w/ Lyon City",

          "It is another beautiful Catholic church. We hiked to the top and it is quite a climb. There is the funicular that will take you as well. There is a lookout along side of the church that gives you an expansive view of Lyon. We didn't experience any issues but as soon as you",

          "A hill top location with a panoramic view of the old city - Beautiful church, interesting funicular ride... What more can one want for a sightseeing spot? Cannot be missed, - and go on a sunday morning to visit the food market along the river on its way back",
          "We went there twice, once to see it and the next time to attend mass. It is easily approached by the metro and funicular. The church is quite huge and magnificent. It is in two stories with the lower level made up of multiple chapels dedicated to the Mother Mary from various",

          "If you find the exterior design of this church beautiful from a distance, then you may be blown away by the interior up close. It is worth the walk up the hill just to see the stunning mosaic walls, and the beautiful ceiling. Remember to be respectful and quiet (and not to take",
          "This is a truly stunning Basilica, the ceilings are sensational. However for me it was the real feeling of spirituality that enveloped me that made this such a special place. So much so that I got up very early the following morning and went to a service in one of the small",
          "The Basilica is well worth the trip up the funicular (or a walk up the hill). It is also worth doing the rooftops tour but be warned, it is in French only and our guide spoke extremely quickly (even some French people commented on that to us). Fortunately most things didn\u2019t",
          "We\u2019ve seen cathedrals in England, Ireland, Scotland, Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary, the US and more. This relatively new structure doesn\u2019t rank with many of them. The exterior is dull and the interior is drab, for all the gold applied everywhere. The reason to go is that a.",
          "This cathedral is perched on a hill side just up above old town on Lyon. You can either take the funicular train up or hike up. The view and the church are both magnificent.",

          "We were very fortunate that our Lyon City Greeter, Jean Claude, brought us here in his own car otherwise we would not have been able to find it ourselves. The view from the top here, Fouviere, is amazing as one can see the entire town of Lyon. We were blessed with very good",
          "We made the hike up the hill from the river in Lyon. It was worth the exercise and a bit of a climb, especially because it is so close to the Ancient Theatre of Fourviere. We happened to arrive during Sunday services so we weren't able to explore all parts of the cathedral, but",
          "We enjoyed a brisk uphill walk through a lovely garden to reach the basilique. Located in a square with a commanding view of the city, this is a great first stop on any city tour. Inside the church is dazzling with gorgeous mosaics. Hopefully your visit will be well-timed to",

          "A must go place in lyon, the view, the cable car. It\u2019s overall a lovely experience. Make sure you go to all stages of the basilique and afterwards to the viewer.",
          "Some fantastic decorations in this church - tile floor, mosaics on the walls, quite spectacular. Take the funicular railway up to it, and then admire the views of the river.",
          "easy to arrive with the cable car but limited passengers allowed and if a tour group arrive at the same time as u expect a wait but once at the top it is just spectacular ok there is the view but its the Church which is Worth the visit on its own",
          "Well worth the trek to get here...you can take a funicular up and walk down. Great views over the city of Lyon from here. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This basillique has two floors with a place of worship in each. Two churches in one! Very impressive architecture even if you don\u2019t like churches you have to take a look at this one.",
          "Well worth the visit (free by the way). To get the most out of it, visit all parts even though it involves many steps. Although we are not religious, we have visited many places of worship over the years and found this to be one of the best including a comfortable atmosphere.",
          "While in Lyon, I visited the basilica various times. Once by walking all the up and then the rest by transportation. The walk alone is beautiful but it is quite a hike. There\u2019s never ending stairs and lots going up hills. But it was absolutely worth it. The view once arrival is",
          "Travelled up through old town ( great for eating ) through lots of small ancient lanes and the park below the summit . Makes the journey more worthwhile. You pass all the stations of the cross and appreciate the construction much more. Impressive inside with magnificent stained",

          "The Basilique is an absolutly stunning building. From the outside it can be seen from very far away due to its pristine white color and golden statue of mary. It is easily accessible and does not usualy have a lot of people making it enjoyable to visit, and not feel like a",
          "The basilica is beautiful in a completely over-the-top way, with gilt and stunning frescoes everywhere inside. Be sure to walk around and get one of the best overlooks of the city from the plaza.",
          "It's free! It's beautiful! It has a great view of the city! Visit it! We visited as part of an bike tour, so the ebikes pushed us up the hill, otherwise it would be a fair slog to climb. Maybe there is a bus??",
          "This gorgeous cathedral on a hill is an absolute must to visit. What more need I say? Then go to the nearby Roman theater.",
          "Caught the cable car to visit the Basilica and it didn\u2019t disappoint us. The Basilica with beautiful stained glass and mosaics. Under the Basilica is the crypt and it\u2019s the size of the top floor. Well worth a visit",
          "Visiting Lyon? Make this no 1 on your list. Entry is free,just a 2 euro donation requested. Inside is quite astonishing.Take the funicular up from Old Lyon. The view over the city outside is fabulous.",
          "When travelling in Europe you tend to visit a lot of churches, and they are always wonderful with their amazing histories and the opulence of their decorations. This church was no exception, plus the great views of the city and its rivers are also great. A must-see if you are in",
          "We used the funicular railway to get up Fourvi\u00e8re hill to visit the Basilique Notre Dame de Fourviere. The Basilique is a magnificent looking building overlooking Lyon (good photo shot is from La Place Bellecour with the statue of Louis XIV is the foreground). The church was",
          "Worth the journey via the funicular railway. We also took via our Lyon Card the optional bell tower & roof tour. Worth every penny to get great views & a different perspective on how it was constructed.",

          "On exiting the funicular railway you are confronted with the stunning frontage and steps which lead to the entrance, once inside the details and decor are stunning, one of the most beautiful buildings I have ever been inside. On the right hand side there are small doors which",
          "This church, located on the Fourviere hill commands a grand view of the city of Lyon. This land used to be a Roman forum where it was built in the 1870s as a tribute to Virgin Mary who is believed to have saved the city from Bubonic plague in the 1600s. The design of the",
          "Well worth the hike up the hill......even for us 70 year olds !! Or take the funicular !! The views are stunning and the Basilica is quite breathtaking !!",
          "From the Cathedral of St John the Baptist, through the Roman ruins and up to the cathedral is a wonderful 2 hours of history in this remarkable city. The basilica itself is breathtaking and the main floor and the basement level dedicated to the Virgin Mary are a must visit when",
          "If you go to Lyon this is the number one attraction to visit. Take the funiculaire (kind of train) to the top. Great view from the top and an impressive Cathedral to visit. Go back down by foot to enjoy different views of the city and make sure to pass by the old roman theatre",
          "This Basillica is on a vast scale. Even the crypt is bigger than a lot of churches. I wouldn't class it as exquisit but it is certainly awe inspiring both in terms of size and location. Well worth a visit",
          "You need quite a lot of time to look at all the mosaics, stained glass and ceilings here. Really good. Also the adjoining chapel.",
          "As far as this place from the old city center, it's definetly worth the trip as the cathedral is magnificent and the panoramic city view is perfect from the spot.",
          "We have been to many cathedrals over the years but this is one of the most impressive. The stain glass windows and mosaic murals are spectacular. This is a HARD climb to get to so would definitely recommend taking the vehicular up and perhaps walking down if you want the",
          "It was a very hot and hazy day, so the view from the church was limited. The church is very fancy, but documentation in English was scant. The funicular (cable car) ride up the hill was clearly needed, but honestly the markings to find the station and instructions to get to",
          "This local church was built at the same time as the Basilica in Paris. The inside was hard to photograph with the bright August Sun. The last mosaic panels close to the altar were not completed until the 1930\u2019s. The middle panel on the right is of Joan of Arc. The first on",
          "You can reach by the \u201cfourviere\u201d and old kind of metro and there it is! The whole city under your feet!",
          "This church is absolutely amazing - and I say this having seen plenty of churches in Europe in my life. I've never been more stunned by the art and design of a European church like this one before. It's definitely worth checking out!",
          "The interior of this Basilique is like no other. Every surface is covered with glittering mosaics or wood carvings. The pillars are stunning, and even the floor was treated with artistic reverence. This is a \"must see\" in Lyon. Ride the funicular up and walk down (note: Your",
          "Having visited Notre Dame in Paris and the ancient Roman ruins of the city in Rome, my wife and I were very excited about jumping on the Lyon city bus and exploring the remains of a Roman Theatre on our way up the hill to the absolutely stunning Basilique standing atop of Lyon.",
          "A site that is visible from all over Lyon. I did not know the history but the mosaics inside are incredible.",

          "It is the main landmark of Lyon, you can see it from neatly everywhere, and it's well worth the trip to the top of the hill (walk, bus, metro, electric bike or scooter).",
          "Medium size basilica, very interesting decoration, unique. worth a trip, don't walk up the hill if you are over 12",
          "This is a must see sight. It\u2019s beauty is something that needs to be taken in and experienced. A very breezy location so hold onto your hat. It has a breathtaking view of the city and you are allowed to take pictures without a flash. Stay as long as you like. Public clean",
          "This Notre Dame is so beautiful ! It looks nice I the outside but on the inside it was breath takingly stunning ! The mosaic work is so intricate and it is worth just seating admiring the artwork ! On the outside there is a look out area where u can see the whole landscape of",
          "To really appreciate the Basilique, walk up the seemingly endless steps of the Mont\u00e9e des Chazeaux from the end of rue du B\u0153uf, then walk still higher up through the Jardins de Rosaire (Parc des Hauteurs). The church is quite stunning with its mosaics and frescoes and dedication",
          "We visited Lyon (Wednesday 5th June) as part of an organised tour and visited the Basilica which stands on a hill high above the city commanding a panoramic view. The Basilica is an extraordinarily decorated place; perhaps the most decorated church we have seen quite awe",
          "Hilly walk from old town, however worth it as there are great views along the way. There is a shorter way via a lot of steps but you will miss the views. The cathedral is breathtaking, very colourful inside and the views of Lyon from the viewpoints are fantastic.",
          "It was a very special and inspiring experience to visit La Basilique de Notre Dame de Fourviere together with my friends! Although the Basilique was build only at the end of XIX-th century the rich details of the interior are fascinating. The Basilique is situated on a very",

          "Less than a 2 minute walk from the ruines of the Roman theater, the basilica is a must see, with a superbe hill side vieux of Lyon. Take the extra 45 minutes to visite and contemplate\u2026 it's worthwhile !",
          "Whether you go for the basilica itself, with grand proportions or for the breathtaking panorama over Lyon and as far as the Alps on a good day, going up the hills is really worth it (by cable car or walking up).",
          "Top view of Lyon. There\u2019s a lot to spot from up so high. Often people there who volunteer their time and give you some history. The basilique itself is just what it is. Great if you like churches I suppose. The main attraction is the view though. Do not miss !!!",
          "A must see when in Lyon. Catch a cable car to the top of Fourviere hill to the majestic Basilica, then walk over to the archeological Roman Theatre still in use for special entertainment events. The view from this hill is fabulous.",
          "Beautiful creations with multi coloured mosaics and rosaceas. Unique style. Surprising crypt below main basilic.",
          "Set high on a hill, this church can be seen from most parts of Lyon. Its interior is covered in lavish, detailed mosaics. Exquisite!",
          "When we drove in, we saw this monumental building rising up above everything else. I thought it was a castle at first, and as we got closer, we saw it was a cathedral. After driving up the winding path, we came upon the structure itself, paid for parking, and got on out. Not",
          "Gorgeous building on top of the hill. Loved the view. The inside with the gold mosaics of history were unique and beautiful. But I have a hard time as a Christian with the emphasis on Mary, which obscures the central role of Jesus.",
          "Don't miss this beautifully decorated immense church. Stone work is incredible as are the mosaics on the inside.",
          "We went to several cathedrals in Lyon, but this one was by far the most beautiful and breath taking. If you have to go to one place in Lyon, I would say this would have to be it. Besides it's art, the Fourviere has a room if you would just like to talk to someone. Not",
          "Accessible by the funicular from Vieux Lyon station, this is the basilica which dominates the Lyon skyline and you can stroll down to the Roman theatre remains 5 mins away. The quaint Victorian era funicular itself will delight the likes of Michael Portillo but having taken in",
          "Nice trip up on the funicular to this church. Lovely views. Go early and avoid the tourists. Slightly concerning the 'beware pickpockets' signs - in a church of all places! Quite a lot of tourists show no respect in places like this which is a disapointment",
          "This is a place worth visiting! The \u201dhop on hop off bus\u201d will take you to this place. You get a beautiful view of the city of Lyon from this place.",
          "Travel by funicular up to this beautiful basilica built in thanksgiving for Lyon escaping the horrors of war ( Franco-Prussian ) The basilica has a beautiful interior well worth the visit",
          "It is visible everywhere from the old city, there up on the top of the hill. It\u2019s beautiful white exterior shining out over the city. Inside it\u2019s just as breathtaking with the main sanctuary and additional lower level dedicated to our lady. Well worth the time to see.",
          "We have travelled extensively around Europe and France and this honestly took my breath away. The inside has so much detail and tiled murals and sculptures you could sit in a seat for an hour and observe every corner and wall. The ceiling is stunning as are the stained glass",
          "Besides it\u2019s beautiful, jaw dropping interior & architecture of the church, it\u2019s nice to be able to see Lyon from up here. Absolutely breathtaking!",
          "We stopped in after going up the funicular train from Vieux Lyon and it was pretty impressive. It's presence across Lyon is unescapable, and it's great to see it after looking up at it for most of our time in Lyon. Once you come out of the funicular, the basilica is right",
          "Take the tram up the hill to this church. Sure, it is just another beautiful old churche, but the tram is fun, the views are amazing, and the church has some interesting history too. In December we visited at the time of the Lyon light festival. At night, the church is",
          "This is an absolute must if you're in Lyon. The interior has two floors, both are spectacular; it looks far away from ground level but is really easy to get to on the Funicular railway and you get amazing views over the city. I can't recommend it enough.",
          "A fantastic visit awaits you, not only for the outlook high over Lyon, not only for the proximity to Lyon's own Tower Eiffel next door, it is for the sheer size if this building and its huge interior and towring structures. Definately put this on your must do list, and you can",
          "I really enjoyed visiting this church, the interior is lovely and the views from the location are amazing. If you are religious there were priests offering blessings in the courtyard,",
          "Great views from here. Took the funicular up. Enjoyed the cathedral and the views over lyon. Then walked down to Roman ruins. Worth doing",
          "Climbing up the esplanade, took us about half hour along the cozy greenery. It was a murderous walk so give yourself time. Better yet, take the funicular and walk down. At top, we were rewarded with nice breeze and great panoramic view of Lyon. A cafe next to the church offered",
          "A nice diversion that you shouldn't pass up and it provides a great view of Lyon. Beautiful Cathedral. The Stained glass windows were beautiful. Everything about it was spectacular.",
          "This is an astounding building. It\u2019s Byzantine architecture almost overpowering. Situated on a spectacular site, it is easily accessed by the funicular extension to the city\u2019s metro system at no extra cost! The view out over the city is worth the trip on its own. The building is",
          "It\u2019s a moderate walk up to the basilica with many stairs. Most of the way is shaded but advise to take water especially in summer. The view of the city from the top is worth the walk. The basilica is beautiful on the inside. No charge to enter,",
          "I walked up there and the reward at the top was well worth it. The views are beautiful, the basilique has some interesting features, but the gardens are a much better aspect. Enjoy a stroll down the hill through some really well kept gardens with surprise statues along the way.",
          "The mosaics were worth seeing plus the view from the cathedral. We came on the hop on bus but there is a funicular from the old city if one doesn\u2019t want the climb.",
          "You can either ride or climb the steps up to this lovely Basilica. The inside is well worth exploring, but for us it was the views from outside. Seated at the top of Fourviere Hill, the red roofs of Lyon, it\u2019s cobblestone streets and the Rh\u00f4ne and Saone rivers make a very",

          "We took a hop on hop off double decker open bus from our hotel and the Basilique was one of the stops. It was just beautiful and surprisingly, there was no line. I know there are folks who are offended by the money that's spent on the upkeep of these religious institutions,",

          "Historic cathedral overlooking Lyon. Beautiful windows. Very steep stairs to negotiate but well worth the effort.",
          "Starting with the funicular ride up to the cathedral is very fun and you may use your public transportation ticket. The gothic architecture is exquisite in details though out. The stone masons and wood carvers really showed amazing crafts at best. Take your time to take it all",
          "From Vieux Lyon stop. It is worth the view. You see it from all angles in Lyon. It is a treat to see the city below. Gorgeous cathedral. We were there when electricity was going on and off. It was a peaceful setting. Go to the crypts below",
          "Our trip has been filled with gothic cathedrals. This is first different one we\u2019ve seen and it blew us away with the painted vaulted ceilings and ornate carving. The location on the hill is beautiful as well.",

          "Visited here on 24 Aug. Breathtaking ceiling in the main body of the church. The crypt much more austere due to the lack of money apparently, to finish it. And it acts as the foundations for the Basilica. Great spot to see a view of the whole of Lyon.",
          "We took the metro and then the funiculaire to the top which was a very relaxing way to get there. Inside we were in awe with the beautiful interiors. Be sure not to miss the crypt or the chapel as they are gems. It\u2019s a shame the photos don\u2019t show the true beauty of this place.",
          "This is a beautiful basilica decorated with millions of tiny mosaic tiles. It\u2019s worth the difficult walk up or taking the funicular. I recommend walking down and visiting the Roman ruins on the way.",

          "I was simply in awe when I walked into the Basilica. The architecture and decorations are stunning and the powerful sense of prayer and solemnity is so moving. Everywhere you looked there was something else to see from 13th. Entire stained glass windows to ornate hanging lights",

          "We visited the Basilique today and found it an amazingly beautiful building, well worth a visit and were able to see part of the mass inside. The inside ceiling, walls and stained glass windows are beautiful. Outside their are amazing views over Lyon city. Definitely",
          "this site is worth visiting built only in the 1880's it is very opulent. A two story basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary - worth checking out - take the funicular up and down",
          "You can see the church from everywhere in the city and its startling whiteness dominates the city. You get to it on the funicular using your Lyon city card and its free to enter. The mosaics on the walls are breathtaking. Get close to them and you can marvel at their beauty and",
          "This XIX century Basilica is very nice with is bizantine-style mosaics, and also offers a spectacular view on Lyon. A lift on the left side permits people with reduced mobility to visit both the main floor and the crypt.",

          "A beautiful church atop the highest point in the city. It is a steep climb to reach the basilica but well worth it. The church is very beautiful with many interesting features. Access is free so donations are a must to keep the upkeep in progress. There are many features to view",
          "Unfortunately we visited during mass and did not have total access to the church. Very understandable. However, we were able to see enough of the church to be very impressed. The view of Lyon behind the church is the best view of the city also.",

          "I thought I would be less than impressed by a \u201cnew\u201d church but how wrong I was. We love Sacre Cour in Paris and this church gives that s run for the money. Neo everything is the style and it seems to work well. Well worth the funicular ride!",
          "Beautiful. Well worth seeing. I noticed that the city tour bus comes up to it but if you're going to walk, be prepared for quite a climb. Definitely worth it for both the church and the views across the city. There's also a cafe there which is a nice place to catch your breath.",
          "As you can see the Basilique from most places in Lyon this is a must to do. We chose it as part of our own self guided tour and were not disappointed when we arrived at our destination. Although there were a lot of steps on the ascent, it gave us the opportunity to see the old",

          "Make sure to take enough time to walk around everywhere. There is a crypt and also a small church on the side. Our daughter was the loudest person in the church, but nobody said anything.",
          "This church is the biggest in the city and the most famous of them all. It is very impressive, and even though it has a lot of decorations, as many Catholic churches tend to be, there's more harmony in its internal appearance. Don't miss the lower hall which is very impressive",
          "The short train ride up to the Basilique is good and the views from the top are well worth the trip. The Basilique is beautiful inside, but very busy with tourists. The history of why it was built is in English, inside the building, and brings home how important a part it has",
          "I loved seeing the Basilique from different viewpoints when in the city. Even up close it is very beautiful, but it does not compare to the inside. We walked in and I found myself saying \"whoa\", it was spectacular. The wall mosaics have gold that make them sparkle in the",
          "One of the most beautiful cathedrals in Europe. A great view of the city. You can either get there walking uphill while enjoying the nice streets of Old Lyon, by funicular or by car as there are parking spots around the cathedral.",
          "The cathedral was stunning from inside and outside, and the best part is of course the view right behind: facing the beautiful city of Lyon ! Can't miss it! The funicular (train) is affordable (including in a 24h transportation pass) or you can also to go there by walk for the",
          "Best time to visit on the early afternoon and with a good weather so that you can enjoy the spectacular view. Go up the hill with the telepherique but take your time and go down to Vieux Lyon through the beautiful gardens.",
          "This was one of the most beautiful cathedrals I\u2019ve ever been in. The stained glass and ornate dome art was amazing. It\u2019s easily accessed via a short funicular ride.",
          "Fortunately it was not too crowded during our visit. A trip via the funicular was worth it followed by viewing some beautiful architecture and art. Lyon\u2019s populace can be rightfully proud.",
          "To say it only took 20 years to finish it is rather very good. The outside has delicate looking small statues. Inside is wow! The mosaics are amazing and tell stories. The ceiling is marvellous. There is also a great view from up the top outside.",
          "Get there by using the funicular, a steep climb otherwise. Inside it is very impressive. We went when a service was taking place and this gave it a very calming atmosphere.",
          "We went to Fourvi\u00e9re Cathedral for Mass. There was good participation in the singing but little supplied to help non-natives understand the liturgy. The cantor led the congregation well (we only discovered later she was blind), and we understand their organist is also a",
          "Incredible experience to ride the funicular up here to see the basilica or to attend Mass. The basilica is incredibly ornate with beautiful mosaics. The view is really impressive too and there are some ancient Roman ruins up here as well. Nice walk down to the old city",
          "We were lucky enough to visit during a service-an unaccompanied vocal by a clergyman in this beautifully decorated building is a treasured memory.The view overlooking Lyon is a photo opportunity not to be missed and the funicular railway a great novelty.",
          "I hopped off the hop on hop off bus at this stop. I only had a short time for my visit and I am really glad I stopped to explore this church. The ceiling is grand and beautiful. I have seen a lot of churches and this is surely one of the top. The view over the city is nice also",
          "Our apartment looked at this beautiful spire and so on a wild and windy day we ascended via the furnicular. Unfortunately as we got higher it got more wild and windy. Luckily we were able to get inside the basilica and we found a lovely church. There are many statues that we",
          "It was quite a hike to the top of the hill, but the rewards are so great. The view of the city is stunning and the basilica, with its splendid beauty, should be visited by everyone who is in Lyon.",
          "Any traveller going to Lyon must visit the Basilique. Located on top of a hill offers you a wonderful view of the city. The architecture and the inner decors are worth to climb the hill or take the funiculaire.",
          "Beautiful stone fa\u00e7ade. imposing shimmering white on a hill overlooking the City. It is neo Byzantine style in and out. The Roman influence is apparent on a visit. It stands at the confluence of the Saone and Rhone rivers. Worth a visit.",
          "A definite must for the visitor to Lyons. The Basilica itself is magnificent and the viewpoint overlooking the city is superb. Not to be missed on any account. We travelled up by funicular from the St Jean area of the old city.",
          "This church sits in Old Lyon, on the original hill of the town. Along the side of the church is an overview that shouldn't be missed. There is a model of the city layout that is quite interesting to see. You might find a guide there and be able to overhear the narrative. The",

          "The Basilica is a splendid example of Neogothic architecture. The inside of the church is huge and very lovely with a fine organ and stained glass. The interior architecture is wonderful. A must see in Lyon.",
          "Walk up to this beautiful basilica, or take the funicular. The church is beautiful inside and out. Go to the back of the church for great views of Lyon.",
          "Some great views here over the city. The church itself is amazing, but a pastiche of traditional churches as it\u2019s only 150 years old. Take the funicular railway up, and try the rather steep walk down into the old town. There\u2019s an elevator to help get around all of the levels.",
          "Really a beautifull Church, a highlights in the beatifull City Lyon. The outside is amazing. A must see in Lyon",
          "Quite a view from everywhere in Lyon, but, I'm sorry, this looks like a poor imitation of traditional churches and cathedrals, with loads of golden little tiles everywhere...there were moments I thought I was at an exhibition from the Austrian painter Kimt. The \"esplanade\"",
          "The Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re is a must see when visiting Lyon. This gorgeous building is situated on top of the Fourvi\u00e8re hill, so it's visible from all around Lyon. When you climb the hill to visit the Basilica, you'll enjoy some gorgeous views on the city of Lyon.",
          "A beautiful basilica in an amazing spot. The views are worth it alone but the basilica is well worth a visit too. Incredible mosaics and paintings.",
          "The church is a must see, it's in great shape and very ornate. The view from on top of the hill of Lyon is the best. When you are done make sure you go to the old monastery which is now a 5 star hotel behind you.",
          "Take the funicular up, it\u2019s free with the Lyon City Card (as well as lots of other museums and activities) or pay with Euro coins, no credit cards. It\u2019s beautiful on the inside, just amazing how it\u2019s decorated! Definitely take in the view around the back at Vieux Lyon and then",
          "You probably have to visit this museum if you\u2019re in Lyon, but the inside isn\u2019t worth much of your time. The cathedral was built in 1870, and the interior is a horrendously gaudy display that makes one wonder if the designers were motivated by even the most modest of religious",
          "This cathedral is spectacular, if you question whether it\u2019s worth the climb or the funicular trip, it certainly is. It is a huge building and it doesn\u2019t disappoint on the inside. It is awe inspiring. We were there in time for mass and it was great to be able to celebrate Easter",
          "Very nice Basilique and very interesting view point nearby. The trip in the Funiculaire was also very interesting.",
          "A must when in Lyon . A pleasant walk up to Fouviere or take the Funicular . The Basilica itself is impressive with the beautiful stained glass . We were in the Badilica for Easter Sunday . The crypt beneath is very large and impressive .",

          "This basilica was truly amazing. It is built in an 'eclectic' architectural style. Interior has amazing mosaics on the main level, and an interesting series of Virgin Marys from all over the world in the crypt. And the views of old Lyon from the surrounding plaza are",
          "Take the F1 funiculaire from Vieux Lyon metro station (3 euro). Drops you at gates to basilica. Excellent overlook to the right as well as a church museum. Walk down to the Roman amphitheatre and museum. There is also the Antiquaille which details lives of the saints and",
          "I cannot put into words just how amazing this building is. The interior just blows you away with its architecture and paintings. I have never seen an interior so beautiful. If you have difficulty walking I certainly recommend using the funicular. I did the walk and had to have a",
          "Beautiful church. Its amazing how this was built in the 12th century. I don't know how they did it back then. The inside is so ornate.",
          "We have been in this church several times in the past 6 years, and I still can't get my head around how it was constructed 400 years ago. Best to get a guide service to fully appreciate the history of the church and the surrounding city of Lyon and the region.",
          "I took the funicular up to the Basilica and have to say I was disappointed. The decoration was over the top and just too much. The view of the city I have to say was superb.",
          "Our guide spoke eloquently to the history of this church and its role in the salvation of the city from war and pestilence. Situated high above the city the site offers commanding views while the architecture of the church is stunning. The Italian glass used in murals and other",

          "Amazing basilica on top of the hill that brings to mind the churches of Rome. The architecture, the frescoes, the coloured glass windows, are all brilliant down to the most intricate details. The panoramic city views from the top of the hill are great. A camera with a good zoom",
          "We visited after getting off the funicular as many do. With our young kids in tow we probably only spent 20-30 minutes in here. Gorgeous craftsmanship. The city view outside the side chapel is lovely.",
          "attending MESSE time during saturday evening , its great and gorgeous place , remember its no photo inside.",
          "Free admission and the view of the city was clear and broad. We spent 1 hour up at the Fourviere . travelled up and down on the funicular",

          "Gorgeous Cathedral situated on top of a hill. A little tiring to walk up but worth it. You can also take a train alternatively. Good view of the city",
          "My word, that\u2019s a stiff climb on foot. Maybe the railway would be better. Even so, the views over Lyon are well worth the effort (especially as the sun sets behind you) and and Basilica is stunning particularly on the inside. But why place a communication tower monstrosity next",

          "One of the interesting places in Lyon and one of the must see cathedrals. Located above the city and had a small square near by with a great panoramic view of Lyon. Cathedral is relatively new that can be said by view of exterior and of course by sign on the wall. Interior is",
          "Perched high on a hill overlooking the old city of Lyon, stands this amazing sight. Reached by foot climbing about 800 steps or funicular. Well worth a visit as both churches are beyond beautiful. It offers amazing views of the city across the river.",
          "The Basilique Notre Dame de Fourviere is a beautiful building with a really great view of the city! It was our favorite thing we did in Lyon!",
          "On pictures this looks like a great place, especially on zoom lenses. In the end it is a simple church, no big deal. I kind of a disappointment. Didn\u00b4t like Lyon att all, although the food is great there.",

          "Perhaps the most visible landmark in Lyon, this basilica dominates the skyline and looks down the entire city from atop Fourviere Hill. During 1870-71 at the time of the Franco-Prussian War, the faithful in Lyons prayed to being spared a seige from the Prussians, and committed",

          "Basilica of Notre Dame de Fourviere, an impressive church built at the end of the 19th century and now one of the cities most famous landmarks. It had an extraordinary neo-Romanesque and neo-Byzantine interior which mildly recalled the interior of St Mark's in Venice.",

          "The view overlooking the city is great at night. Beautiful architecture, fantastic interior. Amazing to think about how this got built built back in the mid 1800s. Best thing is it's free to tour.",
          "It\u2019s a nice place located at the Fourviere but there were limited information with English translation so we struggled to understand the story behind it without further online search. The weather was cold and dry so we couldn\u2019t enjoy the view of the city for long enough.",

          "The basilica itself is lovely and ornately decorated inside and out, and well worth a visit while you're up the hill. That being said, the reason to climb the hill is for the views which you should definitely do as a priority while visiting Lyon.",
          "Beautiful place inside and out. Go inside and take some time to inhale the beauty of the place. In addition , the views of the city are amazing. Don't miss the Roman amphitheatre just few minutes a way. Going down the hill to the old city is just 5 minutes",

          "We did the tour of the basilica which was unfortunately in French but not even that detracted from a brilliant experience. The guide was lovely and tried to accommodate - not his fault really! It\u2019s pretty self explanatory - up the steps and through a few doors and you\u2019re",

          "As a presbyterian Scot, possibly I am not well -placed to review such a strongly Catholic building which stands in such contrast to the cathedral at the foot of the hill. Both the exterior - and especially, the interior, are magnificent. The interior decoration from the ornate",
          "We walked from the Saone River to the Basilica in Fourviere. Not too bad, although taking the funicular would have been faster and less tiring. The view from the Basilica is gorgeous. Fourviere is also where the fireworks were on Bastille Day. The Basilica itself is",

          "It\u2019s currently under repair :( it looks amazing for the restoration work they have already done but there is a huge scaffolding net and tent inside. Outside there is a bit of construction. But you still have a nice view. No trip to Lyon is complete without a visit here...",
          "Beautiful basilica overlooking the whole Lyon. The mosaica in the main chapel is breathtaking. You can take the funicular from Saint Jean cathedral to reach the basilica or just take the slopes and walk (around 30 min of climbing) When there, try wandering through the Fourviere",

          "One of the most incredible buildings we've ever visited. The scale and the detail of the architecture and decoration take your breath away. It's a very steep walk from old Lyon up to the Basilica, but rewarding if you've got the time and the legs. Otherwise take a cab or the",

          "This is a 2 for 1 opportunity to see the richness of religious architecture / mosaic art and a great view of the city. The morning brings with it the tourist groups and the rising sun in your eyes as you look eastward onto the city. Consider an afternoon visit. The surrounding",

          "Ok, I'll start by saying that I normally review hotels and restaurants. I don't normally do religious buildings. Not because I don't like or appreciate them, but I've found them much the same the world over with some notable exceptions. This basilica in the district of Fourviere",
          "This is one of the very top most-do things in Lyon. And by that I mean the whole area -- amphitheatre, museum and this cathedral which is very large and one of the most beautiful churches you will ever see. The way I did it (that is, getting up there) made a lot of sense:",
          "At night from almost anywhere in the city the basilica can be seen bright;y lit on top of the hill beyond the old Lyon district. It is certainly worth a visit, and you can take the funicular up the hill (included on Metro passes) to it. Once there the cathedral courtyard is",

I\u2019d recommend visiting at the end so you can recognise places you\u2019ve been when looking at the view! Make sure to walk back down if you",
          "The basilica is actually fairly new, dating from the 1870-80s, so it is actually rather distinctive as a big, modern church. The interior is ornate, yet in a different way than with older such buildings. We walked up the trails from Vieux Lyon in the early morning and it was a",

        "wiki": "Parc de la T\u00eate d'or (\"Park of the Golden Head\"), in Lyon, is a large urban park in France with an area of approximately 117 hectares (290 acres). Located in the 6th arrondissement, it features a lake on which boating takes place during the summer months. Due to the relatively small number of other parks in Lyon, it receives a huge number of visitors over summer, and is a frequent destination for joggers and cyclists. In the central part of the park, there is a small zoo, with giraffes, elephants, deer, reptiles, primates, and other animals. There are also sports facilities, such as a velodrome, boules court, mini-golf, horse riding, and a miniature train.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before the creation of the park ===\nIn 1530, the lands constituting the current park were the property of the Lambert family, and the location was already named \"Parc de la T\u00eate d'or\". In 1662, an archival document referred to the area called Grange Lambert. The name \"T\u00eate d'or\" was found from a legend saying that a treasure with a Christ's head could be buried in the park. The area was a flood zone composed of \"l\u00f4nes\" (dead backwaters) of the Rh\u00f4ne and \"brotteaux\" (swamps). It remained like this until the park's creation.\n\n\n=== The project of a park ===\nFrom 1812, an urban park in Lyon was planned. Various locations were being considered, like the Presqu'\u00eele or the hill of Fourvi\u00e8re, and then finally, the grounds owned in large part by the Hospices civils de Lyon were chosen. In 1845, the architect Christophe Bonnet proposed, in the purpose of the beautification of the Guilloti\u00e8re quarter, a project of urban park at the current location of the park: \"To satisfy the pressing needs of a large population, I turned the lands and brush of the Parc de la T\u00eate d'or into a planted wood like the Bois de Boulogne.\" This idea was also presented by the Senator-Mayor Claude-Marius Va\u00efsse who wanted to create a park to \"give the nature to those who don't have it\". In 1856, the land was bought from the Hospices Civils de Lyon. Work on the park began in 1856, under the leadership of Swiss landscape designers Eugene and Denis Bulher and lasted five years. The park was finally opened in 1857, although at the time all the work was not yet completed. It was located in the northern district of Les Brotteaux, along the Rh\u00f4ne. A dam was built to make non-flooded vast lands transformed into a park.\n\n\n=== A new urban park ===\n1857: Originally, the Jardin botanique de Lyon was created after a 1794 decree by the National Convention which required the establishment of Central Schools for cities of more than 300,000 inhabitants. These schools were to teach science, literature and arts, and have a botanical garden. Thus, Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert, then mayor of Lyon, applied the decree in the city and created the botanical garden on the slopes of the Croix-Rousse. Completed in 1804 in the Couvent de la D\u00e9serte, the garden was too cramped and was therefore transferred to the park in 1857. It was then composed of more than 4,000 plants. The garden was located in the eastern park to not jeopardize the prospects of the park and break the effect produced by the large central lawn, at the south of the lake. A land for the experimental crops was developed for poaceae, fruit trees and medicinal plants. Now spread over seven hectares, the Jardin botanique de Lyon collections are as rich as that of the Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris. The French rosarian Jean-Marie Gonod started his work here, producing his first cultivars in 1863.\n1859: the orangery was moved from botanical garden on the slopes of the Croix-Rousse to the new park.\n1861: creation of a boating activity on the lake. That year, the park had spaces devoted to the presentation of animals. The plan by brothers B\u00fchler included original entries like a park with sheep, a pen of chickens and a cow pasture. Slowly, a zoological park was created by the arrival of exotic animals, construction and renovation of adapted facilities, the latest being the African plain, inaugurated in October 2006.\n1865: construction of large greenhouses and greenhouse of agave by the architect Gustave Bonnet.\n1867: watercolor map of the park is presented at the Universal Exposition of Paris.\nFrom 1877 to 1880: reconstruction of large greenhouses.\n1881: building of the monument des L\u00e9gionnaires.\n1887: building of the greenhouse Victoria, destroyed in 1980.\n1894: Universal, international and colonial Exhibition took place on the site of the Parc de la T\u00eate d'Or. After an act on 28 August 1884, forts of the Parc de la T\u00eate d'Or and Charpennes were demolished for the creation of the Boulevard du Nord, currently named Boulevard des Belges. The guards cottage, cottages, and the velodrome were built. That year, the Villeurbanne part of the park was annexed by the city of Lyon: the park was for a long time shared between Lyon and Villeurbanne, and the border between the two communities crossed the park. Quarrels and rivalries always arose between the two municipalities regarding expenditures and revenues of the park. French president under the Third Republic Jean Casimir-Perier promulgated on 17 December 1894 the law on the annexation of the section of the park in Villeurbanne to the 6th arrondissement of Lyon.\n1896 to 1898: The city wanted to make a fence to protect the park and to prevent fraudsters from introducing goods hidden by vegetation, as the park was located then at the limit of the grant. On 5 November 1896 was decided the construction of the fence consists of a concrete wall topped by an iron railing. A strong opposition was raised against the idea of a fence: on 17 November 1898, the gate was torn over three hundred metres. The work ended with the break of grids to three entries: T\u00eate-d'Or door, Montgolfier door and the main door of Les L\u00e9gionnaires, now called Les Enfants du Rh\u00f4ne. This latter door was the subject of a competition launched in 1898, won by Charles Meysson. The door was made by the Lyon firm Jean Bernard. It is thirty-two metres length and has two stone pylons. The central door is eleven metres high. The whole door weighs eleven tons.\n1899: construction of collections, cultures and palms greenhouses\n1901: construction of flags of the T\u00eate d'or door\n1904: construction of the stable for cows by architect Tony Garnier which moved to Cibeins in 1914.\n1913: construction of a pier on the lake\n1917: inauguration of new cages for lions\n1932: the underground connecting the \u00cele aux Cygnes and the east bank were opened.\n1961 to 1964: creation of the new rose garden\n1964: creation of the enclosure for elephants\n1968: construction of an enclosure for giraffes, now empty after the removal of the giraffes in their new enclosure in the African plain\n1989: creation of the human right place (Espace droits de l'homme) in the northern part of the park; some monoliths erected contain the text of the statement.\n1991: proposal to build a new entrance in front of the Cit\u00e9 Internationale de Lyon\n2006-2007: establishment of the African plain in the zoo.\n\n\n== Layout ==\nThe park has large grassy areas and rolling terrain. It is bordered by a dike that separates the Rhone and on which the fair and exhibitions were held. After the moving of the Exhibition Centre to the suburbs, in Chassieu, the site became a housing complex with offices, apartments and buildings devoted to entertainment, including the International City of Lyon and the 3000-seat Amphitheatre of the Palais des Congr\u00e8s of Lyon.\nA vast lake of 16 hectares can indulge in the pleasures of boating in summer, thanks to the pier located on the south bank. In the northern part of the lake rise two wooded islands, the \u00cele des Tamaris, accessible only by boat, and the \u00cele du Souvenir on which is erected a memorial in the shape of a quadrilateral. Formerly called \u00cele des Cygnes, it has been converted after plans by the Lyon architect Tony Garnier and the 1904 Prix de Rome sculptor Jean-Baptiste Larriv\u00e9 to honor soldiers killed in combat. The soldiers' names are engraved on the outer sides of walls. An underground corridor provides access to the island, the staircase that leads literally immersed under the lake.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nThe park also contains four rose gardens, but also huge greenhouses, a botanical garden, a zoo and a velodrome.\nThe main entrance, at the southeast corner, is guarded by an enormous wrought iron gate known as the Porte des enfants du Rh\u00f4ne (Gate of the children of the Rhone). The gate, with its gilded features, was installed in 1901, when the park was fenced off for the first time.\n\n\n=== Zoo ===\nThe zoo was created at the same time as the park. At first, it was scheduled to create only of a farm for educational purposes, with some local wild animals, but little by little, developments have been increased to accommodate new animals and the park progressively has been turning into a real zoo.\nThe zoo now houses animals from around the world. It extends over six hectares and counts several hundred animals, including many large mammals, some are very rare, like the Barbary lion, extinct in the wild since 1922.\nIn October 2006, the park opened \"La Plaine Africaine\" (\"The African plain\"), an area where 130 different animals - some belonging to rare and protected species - live in freedom on 2.5 acres (10,000 m2). The African plain is divided into five parts. The savannah part, where Ankole-Watusis, the Nile lechwes, guineafowls and black crowned cranes can be seen, is the largest. It communicates with the part reserved for giraffes. A wet land houses many breeds of birds, including pelicans and flamingos, and lemurs on an island. An adjacent enclosure is reserved for crocodiles, which are allowed to go out only escape during hot weather. At the east end of the plain, a pavilion houses the boses for antelopes, and some sandy enclosures adorned with rocks and stumps, where live yellow mongooses, porcupines, sand cats, and bat-eared foxes and turtles. Other areas in reconstruction in 2010 spring, host servals, leopards and lions.\n\n\n== Points of interest ==\nJardin botanique de Lyon\nStatue commemorating the XXII G7 conference in 1996\n\n\n== See also ==\nBerges du Rh\u00f4ne\nParc de Gerland\nParc de Parilly\nParc Sergent Blandan\nParks in Lyon\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLouis-Michel Nourry, Lyon, le parc de la T\u00eate d'Or, AGEP, 1992, 127 pages (ISBN 290263463-3)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

It was restored between 1988 and 1998, remaining open to visitors throughout this time despite the restoration works. Its collections range from ancient Egyptian antiquities to the Modern art period, making the museum one of the most important in Europe. It also hosts important exhibitions of art, for example the exhibitions of works by Georges Braque and Henri Laurens in the second half of 2005, and another on the work of Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault from April to July 2006. It is one of the largest art museums in France.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\n\n=== Abbey ===\nUntil 1792, the buildings belonged to the Royal Abbaye des Dames de Saint-Pierre, which was built in the 17th century. The abbess always came from the high French nobility and here received the personalities of the kingdom. The institution had a particularly aristocratic slant, as is shown by its renovation by Louis XIV of France in the 17th and 18th centuries. The present state of the palais Saint-Pierre is largely down to these renovations, which included the construction of the baroque refectory and monumental honour-staircase, said to be by Thomas Blanchet. Since then, the refectory has been renovated and now serves as the reception for group visits, as well as housing two monumental paintings on the subject of dining, The Multiplication of the Loaves and The Last Supper, both by Pierre-Louis Cretey. The rest of its current layout was designed by Nicolas Bidaut and Simon Guillaume and is made up of sculptures.\n\n\n=== The Palais du commerce et des Arts ===\n\nThe expulsion of the nuns and the destruction of the \u00e9glise Saint-Saturnin date to the French Revolution, though the abbey's other church (the \u00e9glise Saint-Pierre) still exists and now houses 19th and 20th century sculptures. After the Revolution, the remaining buildings housed the Palais du Commerce et des Arts, at first made up of works confiscated from the clergy and nobility but later becoming more multi-disciplinary. For example, it gained archaeology and natural history collections and those of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences et des Lettres. The imperial drawing school was created in 1805 in the Palais du Commerce et des Arts to provide Lyon's silk factories with designers, giving birth to the famous Lyon School. In 1860, the Chambre de Commerce left the Palais Saint-Pierre and the establishment became the Palais des Arts. From 1875, the museum's collections underwent a major expansion and had to be expanded \u2014 the staircase by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes dates to this era.\n\n\n=== The Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts ===\nThe collections were opened up considerably at the start of the 20th century, leading to the Palais des Arts becoming the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts. The building acquired its present layout in the mid-1990s after the completion of several restoration projects.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\n\n=== Paintings ===\nThe paintings department has European 14th- to mid-20th-century paintings. They are arranged chronologically and by major schools in 35 rooms. The collection features :\n\nAncient French painting (16th to 18th century) (Nicolas Poussin, Simon Vouet, Philippe de Champaigne, Eustache Lesueur, Charles Le Brun, Hyacinthe Rigaud, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Claude Joseph Vernet etc.).\n19th-century French painting (Ingres, G\u00e9ricault, Delacroix, Degas, Renoir, Manet, Morisot, C\u00e9zanne, Gauguin, Van Gogh  etc.) ;\n14th- to 18th-century Italian painting (Perugino, Lorenzo Costa, Veronese, Tintoretto, Correggio, Guido Reni, Domenichino, Pietro da Cortona, Guercino, Salvator Rosa, Luca Giordano, Canaletto, Francesco Guardi, Giandomenico Tiepolo etc.) ;\nAncient Spanish painting (mainly 17th century) (El Greco, Jusepe de Ribera, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n etc.) ;\nAncient German, Flemish and Dutch painting (mainly 16th and 17th centuries) (Lucas Cranach the Elder, Quentin Metsys, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, Rembrandt etc.);\n20th-century painting (including \u00c9douard Vuillard, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Rouault, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Albert Gleizes, Andr\u00e9 Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, Amedeo Modigliani, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Joan Mir\u00f3, Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, Francis Bacon and painters of the Paris School etc.);\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Sculptures ===\nMost of the collection is displayed in two sections: on the ground floor are Medieval and Renaissance sculptures and stuccos of the old baroque refectory; and in the abbey's church are sculptures from the 19th and early 20th centuries.\nAt the heart of the abbey, the former cloister is now a municipal garden, right in the centre of the town, on the peninsula. It is decorated with several 19th century statues:\n\ntwo sculptures by Auguste Rodin : The shadow, or Adam (1902) and The temptation of Saint Anthony (1900) ;\na sculpture by L\u00e9on-Alexandre Delhomme representing Democrites meditating on the seat of the soul (1864) ;\na sculpture by Emile Antoine Bourdelle representing Carpeaux at work (1909) ;\na Venus (1918\u20131928) by Aristide Maillol ;\nan Odalisque (1841) by James Pradier,\na group by Antoine Etex representing Cain and His Race Cursed By God\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Antiquities ===\n\n\n==== Egypt ====\nAncient Egypt is the main theme of the museum's antiquities department, due to the historic importance of egyptology in Lyon, encouraged by men like Victor Loret, whose family gave over 1000 objects to the museum in 1954. From 1895, the mus\u00e9e du Louvre provided nearly 400 objects (unguent vases, funerary figurines etc.) to form the foundation of the department; other objects (canopic vases, jewellery, material from Antino\u00f6polis) were added later to complement this initial donation, and were augmented in 1936 by objects from the artisans' village of Deir el-Medina.\nThe highlights of the collection are its display of sarcophaguses and the gates of Ptolemy III and Ptolemy IV from the temple of Medamud dug by the Lyons archaeologist Alexandre Varille in 1939 and donated by the French Institute of Oriental Archeology of Cairo. The remaining objects shed light on everyday life in ancient Egypt.\nThe collection has 600 works displayed in 9 rooms, in a thematic and chronological sequence:\n\nRoom 1 : Life After DeathThe development of funerary practices are explored via a display of Old Kingdom to Late Period coffins, canopic vases, organs, shabtis and 155 amulets on a variety of subjects. There is also a fragment of the tomb of Bakenranef found at Saqqarah, dating to the 26th Dynasty, as well as a Roman-era shroud.\nRoom 2 : The divine and its ritesDecorations from a temple are recreated along the length of this room, culminating with the gates of Ptolemy III and Ptolemy IV from the late temple at Medamud (the former is fragmentary but retains part of its original polychromy, whereas the latter is nearly complete). The other bas-reliefs in this room come from Koptos - eight are dated to the Middle Kingdom and come from a temple to Min. They were discovered by Adolphe Reinach in 1909 in the foundations of a late building. 11 other fragments come from the end of the Ptolemaic era, and more precisely from the reign of Cleopatra VII. Even if Pharaonic statuary is underrepresented in the museum, the fragment of the statue of Ramses VI in pink granite and the outline of the statue of Commodus as pharaoh document this aspect of Egyptian art.Room 3 : The cult of the divineEntered through the gate of Ptolemy IV, at the centre of this room is a support from a barque or statue dating to the reign of Ptolemy II. On the walls are 3 fragments of bas-reliefs from the 28th Dynasty, also found in Koptos.\nRoom 4 : Images and emblems of the divineThis room's three cases contain a collection of bronze statuettes of Gods from the Egyptian pantheon, with a rare representation of Hapy, god of the Nile, dating from the Late Period. One whole case is devoted to representations of Osiris and another to those of the pharaoh. In this room is the head of a pharaoh of the 30th Dynasty, attributed to Nectanebo II, a Middle Kingdom bust (characterised by its over-large ears), and a scarab with the name of Amenhotep II.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nRoom 5 : Pharaoh and his servantsIn one case are 18 wooden models obtained from tombs from the time of the 23rd Dynasty from Assiout. They represent scenes from everyday life such as grazing cattle, or beer-making. In the opposite case are two displays: one on writing, and the other on the pharaoh's servants. The latter has, among other objects, a limestone statue of an anonymous Old Kingdom couple, a Ptolemaic male bust, and a fragment of a statuette of a kneeling scribe.Room 6 : StelaeArranged around a wooden statue of Osiris are four Middle Kingdom stelae, eight New Kingdom stelae, and four from the Roman era. One of the most beautiful is that of Ptahmose, high priest of Amon, vizir of Thebes and chief of works under Amenophis III, which retains traces of its polychromy.Room 7 : Everyday lifeOne case contains 14 protohistoric and pre-dynastic vases, whilst another shows a selection of vases spanning the New Kingdom to the Late Period. The main display in this room contains many unique pieces, such as the 2nd Dynasty stela of Nes-Henou, or the magnificent wooden male head of the 28th Dynasty, perhaps part of the ornamentation of a harp. It also contains everyday objects like sandals, mirrors, jewellery, and even a stool.Room 8 : Egypt and the Greeks - Egypt and RomeThis room explores Greek and Roman influences on Egyptian art. This is especially prevalent in private works of art such as a series of terracotta figurines of Egyptian Gods with Hellenistic traits, and five 2nd and 3rd century funerary stelae from Koptos showing Palmyrenean influence.Room 9 : Egypt and the Roman Empire - Coptic ChristianityThis room houses gold-plated funerary masks from the Roman period; and bas-reliefs, pateras and textiles from the Coptic civilisation, including a fragment of the famous \"shawl of Sabina\".\n\n\n==== Near East and Middle East ====\nOne room contains cylinder seals, clay tablets and bas-reliefs from the Sumerian, Assyrian and Babylonian civilisations, as well as Luristan bronzes, ceramics and statuettes from Cyprus and a fine collection of Syrian objects (including an anthropoid sarcophagus and a marble bas-relief).\n\n\n==== Ancient Greece and Italy ====\nA single room is devoted to the main work in this department, the 6th century BC marble kore from the Acropolis of Athens. A second room is dedicated to ancient Greece, containing a series of Attic vases in black-figure or red-figure, bronzes and terracotta Tanagra figurines. Finally, a small room is devoted to Magna Graecia, with many ceramics and bronze helmets.\nRoman sculpture is also presented across several rooms - marble statues (a torso of Venus, a child on a cockerel, statues of draped figures etc.) and also small bronze figurines of Gods from the Roman Pantheon such as Mercury, Venus, Mars etc.\nThe Gallo-Roman collections of the city of Lyon, previously presented at the Museum of Fine Arts and the Antiquarium, were transferred in 1975 at the Lugdunum museum on the hill of Fourvi\u00e8re near the Roman theatre and Odeon.\n\n\n=== Objets d\u2019Art ===\nThis department's collection ranges from the Middle Ages to the 20th century and includes:\n\nByzantine ivories\nLimoges enamels\nRenaissance faience and maiolica\nArt Nouveau room by Hector Guimard\nIslamic art\nFar East ceramics\nChinese, Korean and Japanese stoneware (since 1917) - rare pieces illustrating the tea ceremony, displayed next to the Art Nouveau ceramics they inspired.\nThe Death of Polydorus, tapestry\nSilk fabrics produced by Lyon's silk manufacturing trade, including works by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bony.\n\n\n=== Coins and medals ===\nLyon's \"m\u00e9daillier\" is the second largest one in France after that in Paris, with nearly 50,000 coins, medals, seals and other objects. It is known at a European level and has held a prominent place in the numismatic world from its beginnings in the 19th century to recent discoveries of the treasuries of the Terreaux and the C\u00e9lestins.\n\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nThis department was created at the start of the 19th century and includes works on paper - drawings, prints, engravings, watercolours etc. - based on line rather than colour. In all it more than 8,000 works, including ones by Filippino Lippi, Parmigianino, Fra Bartolomeo, Leonetto Cappiello, Nicolas Poussin, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, Ingres, Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault, Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, Honor\u00e9 Daumier, Odilon Redon, Puvis de Chavannes, Edgar Degas, Henri Matisse, Fernand L\u00e9ger and a remarkable study by Albrecht D\u00fcrer.\n\n\n== Magazine ==\nOn the initiative of Ren\u00e9 Jullian, in 1952  the Bulletin des mus\u00e9es lyonnais was created, and 8 years later changed its name to Bulletin des mus\u00e9es et monuments Lyonnais. In 2003 it changed to an annual publication and again changed its name, to Cahiers du mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nCloth of St Gereon, a fragment the museum has in its inventory. It is one of the oldest European tapestries in existence.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon website\u2014(in French)\nVille de Lyon.fr: city's official Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts webpage\u2014(in French)\nAerial view on Wikimapia (Google maps + Wiki)",

          "Lots to see over multiple floors in a beautiful old building, with very friendly and helpful staff. From the anatomically accurate sculptures to the gaudy religious artwork to (finally) the real art pieces such as the beautiful Monet's. Worth the \u20ac8 entry.",
          "Relatively inexpensive with an extensive collection. Located in a beautiful building. We enjoyed a leisurely stroll around. Not too busy.",
          "Excellent art gallery and museum. Amazing collection from Monet, Pissarro, Manet, Gaugin and other masters together with ancient Egyptian and Roman artefacts. Well worth a visit and children under 18 free.",
          "I spent half a day wandering through this museum and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Their Egyptian collection was great (always a crowd pleaser), and their French pieces were also lovely. While there weren't a huge collection of big world masters represented, it was a nice glimpse",
          "The museum itself is presenting some intereting pieces of art but the most interesting is the building itself with its garden at the center. Each first friday of the month, the museum is organising \"one evening at the museum\" which provides a very specific experience feeling",
          "The 2nd museum for Art after the Louvre. Yo've got quiet a resume of all arts. Take a day at list to visit it properly.",
          "A large collection: from Egyptian and Greek antiques, via a small Islamic collection and coins, to statues and a paintings collection that's spanning a range from middle ages to modern art. Not many well known artists though, with the exception of the end of the 19th century",
          "Michelin rates this a 3 star attraction, worth the trip, and we have to agree. It is second only to the Louvre in Paris. The collection is extensive. You need to know that parts of the museum close during the French lunch period, so pay attention to the signs indicating",
          "Museum of fine arts contains many valuable works. People liken it to the miniature Louvre. It's beautiful from outside to inside, there is nothing to blame.",
          "Slightly deceiving name - there is less 'fine art' and more 'antiquities' than the name would suggest. The first couple of floors were mainly Greek, Roman, Egyptian and other civilisations' artefacts. Which is fine if you're interested in that sort of thing. I'm not - paintings",
          "From the sublime Perugino at the entrance to the Acropolis Kore, to the amazing Egyptian collection, the Rodin collection, the superlative Rubens, the famous G\u20acricault Mad Woman, this is a required visit for anyone coming to Lyon. It takes a minimum of two hours.",
          "What a beautiful museum! I spent three hours here, taking in the atmosphere and taking time to really look at the art. The sculpture gallery is stunning. The modern art is great fun. The floor of paintings is beautiful. I finished off sitting in the sculpture garden, reading a",

          "This is a small museum with collections from antiquity to modern painting. There a number of \"masterpieces\" here, and a pretty good collection of 19th century French artists. Signs are mostly in French with a very few in English, and none in other EU languages.",
          "This huge set museum has many treasures to discover. Take your time and enjoy works from many centuries",

          "This was a wonderful surprise to us, that the museum had so many historical pieces. I wouldn't call them art myself, but they are very impressive. A huge collection. We did not like the contemporary art section at all, but it is small by comparison.",
          "An old Benedictine convent in the heart of town. The entry into the garden in the old cloister is free and the museum entrance is further in. The antiquities collection is quite nice. There is a fabulous coin collection. Modern paintings are depressing. The classic paintings are",
          "Housed around a lovely shaded courtyard, dotted with statues. This museum has a very interesting sculpture gallery, plus all the usual other art one expects in provincial museums. The highlight for us was Luca Giordano's Renaud & Armide painting, with exquisite brushwork.",
          "The museum claims to have in its possession a handful of paintings from some of the better known artists such as Van Gogh and Monet. However the few that they do have appear to primarily be studies, rather than great masterpieces. The paintings, over all, become tedious in their",
          "Take your time here, 90 minutes or so. The audio is very good..one of the better Egyptian and Roman displays..",
          "We visited on a Sunday afternoon expecting the museum to be packed but it wasn\u2019t and it was a delight. The variety of work is nice with some famous works from a number of impressionists. The building itself is beautiful. We rented the audio guide which was good. Highly recommend",

          "Located only a few moments walk from Hotel de Ville metro station on the edge of a bustling square the imposing facade hides a delightful and peaceful courtyard / small park which you pass through before entering the main section of the museum. This place is surprisingly huge,",

          "We enjoyed the 2nd floor painting collection one afternoon - it's a great collection that spans a few centuries with plenty to enjoy. The hidden gem is enjoying the simple courtyard inside the museum (free to access and sit to enjoy).",
          "This joins the Tate, the Louvre and the Uffizi in my favourite galleries. Even the gardens are full of fab sculptures, and the paintings are not to be missed.",
          "This is an excellent museum, well designed, airy, with a good audio guide to fo us on key works. It takes hours if you going to explore the whole museum. I focused on the modern art and thoroughly enjoyed taking my time to stand and stare. Well worth the visit.",

          "Even though this place it\u2019s not mentioned by the tour guides as it should be, it is a must go for everyone that stays in Lyon, even if it is for 2 days only.

          "We visited on a weekday afternoon. Not very crowded. The museum is closed on Tuesdays. The museum has a nice collection of European paintings and large sculpture collection. Unfortunate, the contemporary art collection was not open to the public when we visited. We spent about 2",

          "Top 1 museum in Lyon, mainly because of the contemporary art collection, which was unfortunately not available to the public, those days we were in town! A manageable big museum for a family visit, not an overwhelming one, with a variety of exhibits. Furthermore, located in the",

          "We spent an entire afternoon just walking and taking in the art present in this venue. From Rodin's Adam in the garden in front of the museum to his Eve on display in the 18th through 19th century sculpture area, this is a treat, There are unusual paintings here: Pissaro's Pont",
          "I know, we are in France. But I would really expect some more basic information in English. There\u2019s an audio guide available but lots of good information is only available in French with no audio guide references. A pity.",

          "So many amazing art works, would definitely recommend. You have to take time though - this one is about a four hour visit. The art is fantastic and the little gardens in front are charming. Great coffee in the museum cafe as well. People were very helpful and we loved the BIG",
          "A bit outdated museum which seems to miss today's tendencies about what a museum should like. Many great masters are represented but not with their most relevant work. But it is definitely worth a visit. After all, who ants to miss an occasion to see El Greco, Zurbaran, Picasso",
          "It's not the Louvre, and that's a good thing, because this is manageable and the collection has some star items. My personal favourite might be the tablets with punic script and the Phoenician sarcophagus. Not something I have noticed in some bigger museums where one can be",
          "Even if you don't have time,for the modest collection, the exterior alone is well worth the visit. See my pics. Pleasant and well landscaped. Nice museum store.",
          "The museum looks massive, but it is well organized. It's reasonably possible to tour most of it in a few hours, depending on one's approach. Wide-ranging collection over a long period of time. Certainly worth a trip.",
          "This museum has a large and varied collection of fine paintings and sculptures. The floor plan is very easy to navigate. The paintings cover a wide range of styles and time periods. I highly recommend a visit to this museum.",
          "Did not have big expectations, but i had a big surprise and really enjoyed the 2 hours spent here. Some pieces of Renoir, Monet, Bacon, and lots of impressionists, and also sculpture of Rodin.",
          "a quite large collection of very different and interesting pieces of art. Sculptures, artefacts, paintings, there is everything. The museum itself is an incredible building. My favorite part is the egyptian section. Moreover there are always temporary exhibition, I have never",
          "Le Musee des Beaux Arts of Lyon located right in the city center next to the Hotel de Ville is by far the place to see in Lyon if you are into culture. Located in an ancient building the museum is structured on two floors and a sculpture gallery which used to be the chapel. It",

          "A beautiful city. The museum is set in a wonderful square with art and architecture that, if possible, could have been featured inside the museum. The museum itself features exhibits both inside and out. You must be alert as the different floors and stairwells can be a bit",
          "Amazing building, and was also used as the backdrop to a huge lighted show during the festival! Make sure to leave ample time to view all that is on offer.",

          "A number of the galleries were closed when we were there but we enjoyed our visit, particularly the antiquities and medieval sculpture. Worth a visit but its not as large as many of the descriptions of it make it sound.",
          "We spent a couple of hours doing just the highlights tour, from an ancient Egyptian temple gate up to modern art.",

          "The entrance to the museum is a courtyard of sculptures - fabulous! If you enjoy works by Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Bonnard, Pissarro, and others, you'll want to visit this museum. Be sure to check out the self-portraits by Louis Janmot - as a man and as a woman ...",
          "The building s pretty and the court yard as well. The collection is big but I expected more of it .. This is not the Louvre, some impressionist not the best of them.",
          "While we were certainly spoiled by collections in Paris, the museum in Lyon was good and the visit felt quite leisurely! Worth a visit and the courtyard with a nice collection of sculptures is a great place to relax and reflect!",
          "Due to a limited amount of time in Lyon, I wasn\u2019t sure if I could visit, but I did and I am glad I did! For less than \u20ac10 you can walk away with so much knowledge and see so much. The audio guide was worth the cost of \u20ac1. The museum\u2019s exhibits include art from centuries ago to",
          "Our visit was partially spoilt by the museum restaurant. The waiter informed us very explicitly that their cappuccino was 1,9\u20ac each, but we were charged 10\u20ac for two mediocre cappuccinos. Left a bad taste in the mouth. The museum does have an interesting collection of works",
          "This museum is a must see while in Lyon. It is in the Pace des Terreaux, so centrally located. I purchased the audio guide option, which I highly recommend - it was inexpensive (1 Euro) and provided lots of essential information. Good part was that the guide and other",

          "This is a lovely little museum, tucked behind a beautiful garden where people often come to have a lunch or just to relax. The museum itself has a good collection of Impressionists, as well as older works.",
          "Give yourself at least 3hrs to go around. The paintings are spectacular with modern art to antiquities and way back to Pharos time with stunning artifices. Costs 8\u20ac and 1\u20ac for audio guide.",
          "Not a must. Most of the museum is second rate, but the 20th century collection is worth seeing. The building has a lovely inner courtyard that you can enter free and is nice place to sit and rest for a while",
          "One can get up close and personal with many great pieces of art here. Easily doable in an afternoon. Impressive Egyptian collection.",
          "Pretty eclectic and has a bit of everything from French impressionism to ancuent Egyptian Roman and Greek art. The statue gallery is very nice. The garden is serene and good for a little break from the hustle and bustle outside.",
          "As I said, it\u2019s a stunning looking building with a well put together art display.. Definitely allow more time than I had to enjoy it thoroughly",
          "We weren't sure what to expect but were blown away to see so many obviously extremely valuable works of art by famous artists! Degas, Renoir, Rodin, Manet and on and on! The museum wasn't busy at all so we were able to linger over all of these paintings! Very, very enjoyable",
          "This art gallery has a small group of truly extraordinary works, which shouldn't be missed. They are set in a large group of less impressive pieces that we skimmed quickly. This is not a world class collection, but art lovers will still be delighted. Also, there is charming",
          "This museum is huge so allow plenty of time to roam around, lots to see and take in. Great selection of artwork from around the world. I hired headphones for better commentary. There is a cafe for drink or light lunch and a beautiful garden to sit and take it all in.",
          "I have visited this Museum as I like arts and paintings. It was good, some good paintings there but not too many. There is a beautiful park in the courtyard where you can rest on a small bench near the sculptures of Auguste Rodin.",
          "This is a good second tier museum with a bit of everything but for me not a lot of exceptional art. I liked the courtyard of the building best of all. Very peaceful. It seemed difficult to get a pastry for coffee and cake. Restaurant seemed to be into more substantial",
          "The museum is located by the hotel de villa (town hall) which is also a beautiful building. There is an impressive fountain directly opposite the museum entrance. You can have a relaxing seat in the garden which is a haven away from the bustle outside. Check out the art nouveau",
          "Having read the tourist information on this art gallery and museum, we really expected to find a world-class colection: instead, we discovered only a very good 'provincial' collection of paintings. There are significant gaps in the collection - no Rembrandts, Durers, only one",
          "Interesting place to spend 3 hours or so. Undertook a kids trail on iPad only in French which was a challenge but children enjoyed it. There are some fairly conventional historic galleries with a fine Egyptian gallery, followed by painting curated by time periods. There are a",
          "The museum building is beautiful, and wasn\u2019t too crowded. We paid an extra euro for the audio guides, and just visited the top items suggested. These included paintings, sculptures, and small items - old and older! And of course we had a pleasant stroll past lots of other items",
          "If you live in London then you are used to very large museums, this will then seem rather small. However its well worth a visit as has a diverse collection of very interesting pieces especially the Eygptian collection",
          "We visit museums and galleries in cities around the world and given the high standards of Paris we thought that the main museum in France's second city was bound to be good. But we never really connected with the place, feeling it lacked focus. Perhaps they are trying to cover",
          "We absolutely loved this museum and highly recommend it if you love art. We spent our time on the second floor with the impressionists and modern art plus gems like the must see Reubens. 13 year old just starting gcse art was amazed by the huge collection. The best thing is how",

          "Set in a fine building on the main square of Lyon, this is an extensive museum with an extensive collection of interesting art and artefacts on display. Entry was 8 euros, so not that cheap, but there are several floors to explore that includes a large collection of artworks by",
          "For 8 euros one can spend an enjoyable couple of hours enjoying the art in this museum. It does have a painting or two by some very famous painters, but not their finest or most famous works of art. Monet, Degas, Renoir, Picasso, Ruben\u2019s to name a few",
          "Housed in a lovely building near Hotel de Ville, this museum is a delight. Due to its manageable size, we were able to enjoy all its highlights as well as other less well known treasures, sculpture, paintings, and Roman artefacts, often intact.",
          "A really impressive collection of paintings and sculpture and many other pieces including ceramics and mummies. The building is really handsome and the centre courtyard garden is relaxing and full of trees and sculpture. What annoyed me was that we couldn\u2019t eat in the Museum",
          "Quantity over quality really. Plus part of the museum closes 1.15-2.00 which was a bit inconvenient. Nice courtyard to sit in before or after your visit.",
          "Sculptures, paintings, bronzes, porcelains, ... there is a fair amount of good quality exhibits. The paintings gallery 17-18ctry were the most impressive. A beautiful courtyard just at the entrance of the museum is nice to relax at.",
          "There is a very large collection in the museum, it can take nearly a whole day if you want to visit all rhe museum in details. But you can make your visit around a certain theme which can facilitate your visit. Therw are brochures about thematic visits. We participated to a",
          "To be honest, I was hoping for more. The art was too heavy for my taste - I much prefer the impressionists - so I wasn\u2019t drawn to much here. But the gardens were beautiful and I found sitting there amongst the statues and art pieces was perfect.",
          "While the collection is relatively small these are impressive works both in their singularity and collectiveness.",
          "In France, this art museum is second only to the Louvre. Entry admission was a bargain, without the crowds that you experience in Parisian museums. Staff were very helpful and friendly. The exhibition spaces were very well designed. In addition to the interior exhibitions, there",
          "What a lovely art gallery - well-presented, not too packed, plenty of space to take stock and look at the beautiful artwork. It was nice to be able to sit and enjoy the gardens as well as the artwork.",
          "This museum had a wonderful Impressionist collection. It also had paintings from Italian and Flemish masters. Good sculptures. They had information on an audio guide and on a paper handout. I would just recommend going with the paper.",
          "While there are a few masterpieces here, much of the art is 2nd rate at best. Whole floors are closed without warning - mostly at lunch time. We were about to visit the 1st floor (the main one) and were told it was about to close for an hour or two. A strange way to run a",
          "Located in a beautiful building ( next to an even more beautiful building, hotel De Ville, and a gorgeous fountain in front, the museum used to be a convent and became a museum after the French Revolution. Excellent exhibits spanning the ages, including a sizable collection of",
          "Give yourself enough time to visit. I was in a bit of a rush - so i whizzed through it quickly. But its three floors of really good art works.The square in front of the museum is lovely - nice picture opportunities.",
          "This museum of fine arts (Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts) is situated on the Place des Terreaux in Lyon. It is hosted in an impressive large building. I am not the biggest art lover and I don't know much about it, but I decided to visit it because it was included in my Lyon City Card.",
          "Just lovely. Gorgeous building and a tip - take a picnic and eat lunch outside in the lovely gardens. Another tip - one floor is shut for lunch so check times - it is the best floor! The quality of art work here is fabulous and is nicely displayed. The best thing is it is not",
          "Lyon's Musee des Beaux-arts tries to cover the entire spread of western civilisation, including objects from Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and the Roman and Byzantine Empires, but it is not particularly strong in these areas though there are some interesting items. For example,",
          "and work your way down. Many pieces are not by artists of great reknown so you might go more quickly and concentrate on the first and second floors.",
          "This is a wonderfully executed art museum that is refreshing after the behemoth museums of Paris. It manages to have a great breadth of works for its size. Some treasures include the delightful salon de fleurs to break up all the baroque religious art, and an el Greco and a Van",
          "Beautiful building. The collection is quite impressive and varied and rich. I spent two hours inside and would have stayed all day long had i had the time for it. It is also worth having a coffee at the restaurant inside the museum. It is a bit expensive but it is a nice place",
          "Beautiful museum with great collections and sculptures. Some amazing Egyptian art as well. Definitely worths a visit.",
          "This large museum is well organised, and the first floor takes the visitor through the ages, beginning with ancient Egypt. The majority of paintings on the second floor have a religious theme, which I found rather tedious after a while, but the modern section was excellent.",
          "Lovely museum to visit with pieces from Rodan, impressionists, and of course Egyptian Antiquities. Bit off the tourist path, but highly recommend it!",
          "The museum is beautiful and the permanent collection impressive. We first visited last year for the Matisse retrospective, which was extraordinary but overcrowded and viewing was difficult. I returned this trip to see more of the permanent collection, which contains some",
          "On a less than pleasant afternoon, we decided to visit this museum/ gallery, whilst I was very keen to see the impressionist paintings - which took us some time to find. But it was the lower ground floor with the sculptures that we really enjoyed. Had a cup of coffee in the",
          "We got free entrance with the Lyon City card. The reception was very friendly - you show your card and they give you an entrance pass. Lots of pictures and sculptures (lower floor)- but I actually liked the Egyptian exhibition the most. Most of the artwork were by artists I",
          "With my guidebook\u2019s 3 stars thought this would be amazing....found that there was not as many impressionist artists as I would have liked to have seen...still worthwhile. Very good antiquities sections....but had my heart set on more art of appeal and there wasn\u2019t so much.",
          "You need to go. A solid attempt to be an encyclopedic museum. Egyptian to Picasso. Well displayed and stylish in a museum sense.",
          "The egyptian artifacts were very interesting; I had never seen real egyptian stuff up close before. So well preserved and beautiful. Lots of religious art, unfortunately missed the last floor with contemporary stuff but I really wanted to see it. Sculpture floor was completely",
          "went to see the impressionists, not that much and some missing does not live up to its propaganda . not worth it for the impressionists",
          "We were disappointed to learn that the 20th century rooms were being used for a special exhibition, but went on the traditional visit from Egypt onwards. What a revelation - so many intriguing and impressive items, large and small! And so it continued, through successive",
          "I'd heard that it was the 2nd best art museum in France. #1 is the Louvre. It is a very good museum with a wide range of exhibits from medieval to modern in a great space.",
          "This museum has a fine collection of art from many periods. There are many interesting and beautiful pieces by artists both well and lesser known. I enjoyed my visit very much. The restaurant/cafe was also lovely and I enjoyed a very fine lunch there. I found everyone working at",
          "Since I had the city card the museum entrance was free. They had a special exhibit, which I enjoyed very much and then later, I went to see the permanent collections. it would take hours to see and appreciate it all, so bring lots of time.",
          "As an art lover, I was anxious to visit this museum as its collection was praised by Rick Steeves in his guide book. Although he stated that there were no famous paintings in the collection, it was the second best collection in France after the Lourve. After having visited",
          "From prehistoric through modern art in a beautiful setting including murals by Puvis de Chavannes in the elegant stairway, this is a lovely museum. I learned of many artists from the region and from Lyon.",
          "Don't miss this museum if you are in Lyon. Some excellent art works by Rubens, Zurbaran, Perugino, etc.",
          "We spent about 2.5 hours at the art museum - which included the temporary exhibit. You can check your coats for free. Nice collection of a variety of eras from various counties.",
          "You should miss this. For 12 euros, I enjoyed the Mexico/France exhibition plus the permanent collections. Fab impressionist pictures, but also an impressive collection of marble statues, commemorative medals and Art Nouveau furniture amongst other stuff. Not a lot of any",
          "Had so looked forward to my visit but was disappointed. Requested an audio guide and paid for same although was indicated as being included in the price. No one was available at the desk to distribute the audio guide so was just handed a returned one by a staff member. This was",
          "We stumbled upon the museum and figured we\u2019d check it out. We were pleasantly surprised to find not only that it wasn\u2019t crowded, but there was a very impressive collection including Renoir, Monet, Manet, Gauguin and Rodin! Very nice museum!",
          "The special exhibits are particularly interesting and well curated. The permanent collection is high quality with useful accompanying commentary. Coffee shop was excellent for a relaxing pause for coffee and a sweet.",
          "This Museum is centrally located and easy to get to on foot or public transportation. It includes the types of exhibits you would expect to find in a fine arts museum but also includes special exhibits. We enjoyed the Frida Kahlo exhibit and works by her husband, Diego Rivera.",
          "The most touching part of this museum, besides the magnificent collection, was the accesibility of the art: it felt close and intimate and even familiar. There was a festive atmosphere when we went: lots of folk standing close to each piece and talking about what they were",
          "Menu consisted of soups and sandwiches of meats and various cheeses. Quality of food was good. Great deserts. Staff friendly and polite. Dining room is cozy.",
          "Loved the paintings, antiquities but also the expansive coin collection, it was so well curated! I highly recommend spending at least 3 hours here.",
          "Visited here using the Lyon City Pass Card. It is a massive museum and art gallery housed inside a very impressive building. Loads to see, you could spend hours inside. We concentrated on the particular sections of interest to us but still managed to spend 2 hours looking",
          "Enjoyed walking round this impressive building. Our aim was to see the impressionists and later. These turned out to be a small proportion of the total with a Van Goch and Picasso missing. Huge mural in the very good cafe apparently by Raoul Dufy. Worth a visit just for this.",
          "The museum has nice collection of paintings, especially for Louis Janmon, that I just discovered. The architecture however was very simple",
          "The museum and it's garden was fantastic. It is a must visit for art lovers and families with kids. It is located right at the center where you can easyly walk or take a tram or metro line. It has two floors with sculptures and paintings. Some rooms were so fascinating I wanted",
          "Surprisingly good museum in the Place des Terraux. Do not be deterred by the sculpture hall with plaster copies and go upstairs to see two very nice Poussin paintings.",
          "We only spent a morning here but you could spend years and never really see everything that is on display here. I loved the variety of paintings, sculptures, coins, Egyptian artifacts, medieval displays, weapons, and other. A must see in Lyon",
          "Not jam-packed with masterpieces, but there is enough quality and quantity to make the Musee des Beaux-Arts worth a visit. I'm always glad to discover an artist or works that are at least new to me. Despite the name though, almost half of the museum is devoted to history-",
          "We were surprised and delighted to find this wonderful museum while on our visit to Lyon. The collection is stellar, and the hours we spent on site were well worth it. I highly recommend this first class museum to art lovers.",
          "Visited here twice on our recent visit to Lyon. Well laid out. Lockers to leave luggage in which is handy if visiting on arrival or departure-big enough to hold wheelie bags. Information in English as well as French. Can hire audio guides which we did on our first visit. Only",
          "This is a large museum, and the highlights for me were the excellent archaeological collection, especially the ancient Egyptian collection with mummies and entrance gates. Also the ancient Greek collection is quite large, and the early medieval and medieval Western art selection",
          "I suppose one\u2019s view of an art gallery is very subjective. I can\u2019t say there were any pictures which really blew me away. There were quite a number from the early period & much of a muchness. There were also a fair proportion by local artists which is understandable. There were,",
          "Perhaps we have been spoilt by museums and galleries in London but we found this museum underwhelming. Yes, it is a nice building with a pleasant courtyard, but the layout and signage internally is confusing and the paintings hung in a rather desultory manner. The handful of",
          "Housed in a beautiful building, the collection of the museum is impressive, ranging from ancient Egyptian coffins, Greek and Roman statues, to 21st Century pencil drawings. I especially liked the Islamic art section, including some marvellous Iznik tiles from the 16th Century.",
          "It is a middle size musee with nice garden. From the arts here, we understand more about lyon. We stay here one day.",
          "Doesn't take too long to cover this museum. Mostly older paintings and the art is arranged by time period and country the artist was born in. A few impressiononist paintings (Monet, Renoir, etc) and a few nice Rodin sculptures. Enjoyable spot to visit that won't overwhelm you.",
          "Well worth visiting. There\u2019re artistic works and historical exhibitions that are quite unique, all well-displayed over well-planned galleries",
          "The pacing of the tourist orbit can be judged by authenticity: this got 10/10. Across history from the Ancients of Egypt to Africa they got a preternatural reflection of cultures. And that goes for Rome especially. We were in a rush and so had to downsize our investigations",
          "The museum is situated in ex-convent building and a part of its collection is exposed in a former church! Fine collection from the ancient objects (Egyptian, Greek, and Roman) to modern art. Good and vast selection of French sculpture and painting. Exceptional Perugino in the",
          "Very interesting museum with good shop and a lovely cafe with terrace overlooking the courtyard Buildings quite impressive but not a very friendly museum",
          "I had read this was France's second best art museum after the Louvre, so was expecting more. Covers a wide range of art, but not many of the Old Masters or Impressionists.",
          "This is definitely a must when visiting Lyon: great art collection in an elegant and imposing building. Very centrally located.",
          "The building and setting are beautiful, and a visit here may be one of the high lights of your trip to Lyon. It's a good collection, and I was especially impressed by the presence of many paintings by all the great French artists. You will also find a solid collection of Roman",
          "We love impressionists and there are plenty of these here. The museum is deceptively large. Good value for money.",
          "What can you say? So many masterpieces: it was overwhelming! We went here as part of the Lyon City Card, which is the deal of the century.",
          "lots of works by lesser-known artists; before you go into the museum, sit in the tranquil and attractive gardens (free); once inside, the toilets are clean (lift to 3rd floor); the exhibits are well curated",
          "This museum has a wonderful collection, much like the Louvre, but without the masses of tourists. Wheelchair accessible and allows free entry for the disabled and companion. Be sure to have your handicap placard with you. Highly recommend.",
          "We spent a whole afternoon wandering through this gallery and enjoyed the mix of paintings and sculptures. well worth a visit",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Currently under a refurbishment programme till 2019. 3 floors open with immaculate paintings and gorgeous altar pieces. Very intricate, gold lacquered, totally stunning. Very knowledgeable staff.",
          "An excellent art museum and the second biggest in France after the Louvre. I t would take several hours to adequately view the museum. I recommend the earphones as they add alot to your visit to the museum. Classical sculptures, Egyptian collection with art from Monet to",
          "We spent four hours in the place and only managed to touch the quantity of offerings in the museum The old classics take a bit of beating , however the modern section was interesting but certainly not my cup of tea It is very good value however I would highly recommend getting",
          "Spread over a number of floors, do much to see and well explained. Spent a number of hours even though we hadn't planned to",
          "An amazing collection of classical sculptures, illustrating Lyon's Italian connection. Grandiose but at a human dimension.",
          "Not the best art gallery I've been in but if it's raining it's a good place to go. Some of the paintingso are hung so that the shadow of the frames are cast upon them....really not acceptable in a gallery. 8 euro to get in.",
          "This is one of Lyon's gems. A wonderful collection of art and artefacts laid out over 3 floors. The displays take you from Egyptian, Greek, Roman to modern times. There is some astounding art from the 19th and 20th centuries. The Hector Guimard bedroom furniture is fantastic.",
          "Off course there is much attention for local painters, but the collection gives an overview of different periods. There is on Van Gogh, 1 Rembrandt, 1 Rubens, 1 Gauguin, 1 Tapies, couple of Monets, a lot of Rodins, etc. But it allows a short visit through time between",
          "This is a very large museum with quite a lot of everything. But few outstanding pieces... The courtyard is charming with a lot of fine statues though. The building is rather nice. Very high roofed to have been a convent...",
          "Covering all periods from Ancient Egypt to contemporary art, the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts de Lyon is in my opinion the second greatest art museum in France after the Louvre. Worth a long visit!",
          "This is a lovely world class art museum in the center of Lyon. It\u2019s not the Louvre, but it has a nice collection of works. We enjoyed our morning here. It\u2019s layed out nicely with clear directions, and the air conditioning works well.",
          "My son lives in Lyon (6 years) He loves the city and promised us we would too. He took us here the first day---and I LOVED IT. Breathtaking and Beyond! I loved being able see wonderful works of art just inches from me. I feel by telling every detail of this museum would be like",
          "Located near the Opera where the commercial precinct becomes more institutional and monumental the Museum occupies an ald benedictine Monastery. This is not made apparent by the structure of the building and other denotations. It houses a charming cafeteria and in essence it is",
          "We spent hours enjoying the exhibits. In fact our ticket was good all day, and we spend a couple hours, went and had lunch then went back. The audio guide was a great source if information and made the visit to the museum much more interesting. I had heard the restaurant in the",

          "I\u2019d heard a lot about this museum and wanted to visit for some time. It did not disappoint, offering a comprehensive collection of fine art from across the centuries. It is so big you could spend all day there, perhaps lunching in the terrace restaurant, or having a break in the",
          "If you have been to the Louvre then you can bypass this museum. Whilst it is touted as one of the biggest museums in France ( and Europe ) I found it a poor random collection of the masters. If you are English speaking then it will be even more disappointing as no painting",
          "A major museum hosting some major works. The late 19th and 20th century exhibits are excellent, but there is also works back to ancient times. Arranged in largely chronological order. But the information and signage need a major overhaul!!",
          "Said to be 2nd only to the Lourve in Paris, but my opinion is that it has a VERY long way to get to that level. Most of the paintings needed cleaning and for my opinion second rate. The Greek Roman and Egyptian stuff was typical. But worth the time spent.",
          "This is a very important museum for France. Its collection is excellent and perhaps second only to the Louvre in scope It is part history museum ( ancient egypt, greece, rome, etc) as well as a large fine art collection. The museum also has a large courtyard, which can be",
          "All the major French artists are represented making this well worth a visit. Lots of interesting sculpture as well as areas on Ancient Egypt. Nice garden area before the entrance.",
          "For those who enjoy the arts this is a \"must visit \" Wonderful collections across the ages and beautifully displayed Worth several hours visit",
          "Really nice museum, particularly the sculpture, which I concentrated on. Many of the sculptors are also displayed at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris and I found one piece that was a duplicate in both museums. This is well worth the time to explore, while in Lyon.",
          "Really interesting and ricjh collection of impressionist peinture. We spent a few hours going through one room to another without feeling the time passing by. Also we enjoyed the egyptian room. Truly recommend!",
          "We spent most of our time in the galleries with 19th c. and Impressionist paintings - a good collection with many wonderful pieces. It's not as extensive as the Louvre or some of the other world's most famous museums, but it's all well-displayed and terrific. There is also a",

          "If you don't understand French and has been to the museums in Paris, Milan or Rome before heading to Lyon. Advise is it may be a waste of time. Out of the many pieces, only appreciate about 5 artworks, 2 of which are Monet's.",
          "fixed price menu was great and we ate here on several occasions during our stay. Convenient and the staff was very accommodating.",
          "Nice collection, with exhibition pieces from antiquity to the 20th century. Dont miss the sculptures in the chapel! I followed the exhibition along the timeline: from the Egyptian pieces to the 20th century and found that very good.",
          "This is the largest collection of old masters in France outside of the Louvre. Some say it is the best fine art collection outside of the Louvre. It was truly stunning. Renoirs, Monets, Manets, Vuillards, Gauguins, the Dutch masters, Degas. The building itself is art as well,",
          "We only has 2 hours to spare so could not cover the whole collection. We concentrated on the paintings. There is a good array of French artists, including artists from Lyon. The Impressionists are well represented and other well known artists. The museum is well laid out in what",
          "After reading about it, I really thought it was worth the time. The modern collection part was closed due to some renovations. Some impressionist's paintings I had never seen. Good collection, although nothing to do with Le Louvre ( cause that is what you read). The building is",
          "First, this is worth the effort (and it was an effort) to find what you like in this museum. Unfortunately, it is difficult to navigate the building complex or to follow the thinking of the curators, so be a prepared to do a bit of work and to ask directions! In the end it was",
          "An outstanding collection of masterpieces. Plus the best collection of sculptures I have seen. All housed in a truly magnificent building, close to a Metro station. Only complaint (as for other Lyon Musees) in that not just English but other language translations are not",
          "This is a beautiful museum (former abbey that Napoleon nationalized) that has significant paintings, sculptures, and artifacts from ancient Egypt and Greece, and so much more. It's less than a 5-minute walk from the Metro stop. The audioguide costs only 1\u20ac and is well worth it,",
          "The Beaux Arts Museum is the most visited in Lyon; the galleries show fantastic collections of Europ\u00e9an paintings and sculptures, fantastic artistic splendours of the place will command your admiration.",
          "Big museum with a very large collection of sculptures, paintings and ancient Egyptian pieces like hyrogliephes and sarcofages! Just a dissapointment that the Charing Cross Bridge painting of Monet is actually displayed in another European museum.",
          "Very nice location , easily accessible too. There is a very pretty garden you have to walk through before getting into the museum. The inside is very impressive with beautiful art. My only complaint is that some of the rooms of the museum are very warm and stuffy. It's",
          "The fine arts collection is really good, and also the building itself together with the yard are worth to have a look. Only down side was that there wasn't much information in English.",
          "First of all the building interior is outstanding especially the Art Nouveau decorated stairwell is stunning. Great sculpture, Pre-Raphaelite paintings, the Egyptian collection, and a rare collection of medallions which the French do so well. Amazing museum truly second only to",
          "An old but grand convent has been converted to a fine arts museum. High quality and high quantity of art, including a good deal of sculpture. (The collection in the former chapel should not be missed.) Nicely organized on historical lines, no surprises in the display, except",
          "Located in a former monastery you can go into the garden for free- your bags are searches but this is it. Beautiful court yard which seems popular with the locals. Also free the access to the refectory- gorgeously renovated. Then the real thing starts and the museum will keep",
          "We visited the top floor (19th and 20th century art) and the middle floor for its Egyptian antiquities. There was a little bit of good stuff from a lot of genres but little textual information to go with it and the place was poorly laid out - bit of a maze. Considering this is",
          "A pleasant gallery and museum to see. Highlight for us was the impressionist paintings and a superb lunch in the musem's restarant",
          "There are some great paintings here, particularly if you like 19th century. However the use of space and temporary walls looks a little shabby, and some of the lighting of the paintings is poor. Nonetheless a gallery worth visiting.",
          "This was a surprise, the quality of the pieces in a lovely building. Smaller in scale and all the art pieces very accessible. No crowds. A nice cafe on the upper floor with a view balcony down into the enclosed garden.",
          "This museum is not well laid out and most of the art is fairly average. It was easy to miss whole section because of the poor layout. It was good to get out of the biting wind for a while.",
          "This museum was one of the first places that I visited in Lyon and it gave me good feelings of my visit there. I enjoyed the fine arts collection there. It was a really big collection of beautiful arts in terms of paintings, sculptures, artists. It is quite cheap and worth",
          "The museum is closed on Tuesdays (as are many museums and galleries in France), which meant that we only had two hours on Wednesday morning for our visit. This was nothing like enough, since one would need several days to do justice to this remakable museum. Outstanding Egyptian",
          "The setting of the museum is lovely; a former abbey, I believe, with a lovely courtyard. The coin collection is a history lesson in itself, and the Egyptology section is incredible, like walking through Luxor itself.",
          "A very welcoming museum full of wonderful things, all well displayed. It's quite large, so allow enough time. They give out handy guides to their top 20 masterpieces, which is helpful, and there is also a handy app. The collections are pretty amazing - I hadn't bargained on the",
          "Nicely presented and laid out. A good selection of Degas. Interesting Eygyptian section.Poor samples of the more famous painters but a good selection if others highlighting the development of art..",
          "We visited the Matisse exhibition - excellent, albeit rather busy. This is the second time I've visited the permanent collection and find that, on the contrary, isn't busy at all. It's therefore a real pleasure to enjoy the paintings and get up real close to the art without",
          "the architecture, garden, courtyard and style of this historical building supplemented the paintings at the special exhibit i went there for.",
          "If you are not interested in museums, please visit this one. Enter the exterior gate door and be sure to look up at the galleries overhead. The decorations are just as enjoyable as the displays inside. The courtyard is not really interesting, so don't judge the museum by tired",
          "We are visiting the MBA every week to follow a short program looking \"the Art History\" through several centuries. The fabulous collection of painting and sculpture are always exciting for us.",
          "Wether you are in Lyon for a short trip or a long one, you must stop by the Museum. First to enjoy the architecture. Second to wander in the inner courtyard, where you feel away from the city. And then to enjoy the collection of paintings, that are here permanently or the",
          "This gallery is well worth a visit. Very extensive so wise to study map and select preferred rooms. The building (a former Benedictine Abbey) is beautiful. If you do not have time to visit the gallery it is worth taking a look at the courtyard (former cloisters).",
          "Just Go. Especially if you love art. They have some wonderful pieces from all over the world, but especially from French artists.",
          "When in France, its always worth while to check out the museum of Art...you will always find treasures. Here is no exception, many many works beyond measure. Find your favorite. I found several :)",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this museum and viewing the many Matisse drawings,sketches, paintings and sculptures. The museum is very accessible and staff were excellent in their organization and set up. The exhibit is very popular and the halls and rooms were full of art admirers.",
          "We went to the Matisse exhibition which was very good covering his whole life. Only had a quick look at rest of galleries but some interesting works",
          "Musee des Beaux Arts in Lyon has a huge range of paintings, sculpture and artifacts from several millenia, starting well before the time of Christ. The Egyptian, Greek and Babylonian exhibits are particularly noteworthy. As well as good pictures by local artists, there are many",
          "The Beaux Arts museum is amazing, if you have the time, you must go. The permanent expositions are really good, but the most incredible part is the temporary Matisse exposition. Perfectly well presented and organized, is a must see for art lovers.",
          "I had a few hours and visited this museum, always interested in the arts, decorative and otherwise. I recommend this despite how imposing it looks even if you only have a short period to visit.",
          "It has good collection of art from different period and many era of the history in Europe. I feel like walking in Louve Museum but small version with their varieties. However, I feel a bit confused of the direction that not to miss out anything. 2 hours is good time to spend",
          "It was a rainy day so we thought a museum would be the perfect way to spend a couple of hours. We were sold on this museum and told it was second to the Louvre. Well, if so, there is a huge gap. In defense, the museum did have wonderful Impressionist and Modern art exhibited;",
          "What we did get to see was amazing, but the first floor (sculptures) was completely closed and the second floor (ancient artefacts and objets d'art) closed at 1pm when we were only half way through! On the third floor (paintings), the 20th century galley was totally closed for",
          "We visited the entire museum in about 1 hour, which was very fast. Yet, we were able to see a large variety of artwork from many painters from different times.",
          "Nice musee with rich collection, Egypt, Greek items and European painters.Sculpture gallery and modern painters parts are the best!",

          "A late minute decision to visit the MBA was an excellent decision. A fantastic collection of classic artists, sculptures, and objects de art were complemented by a dellightful staff member giving a one hour guided tour of impressionistic painters. Spend the extra 3\u20ac For the",

          "For 8\u20ac you will have a great experiance of French art to marvel at. We spent 2 hours here and loved every minute.",
          "Good selection of pictures. Interesting that there were very few British artists featured and I was not familiar with the French artists on the whole.",
          "The audio tour was incredibly revealing about the Egyptian, Roman, and early civilization artifacts. They have a very nice collection of these items. The coins are also very nice. Turning to the paintings, they have a very large and extensive collection of pre-impressionist",
          "So many paintings by famous artist we were star struck. A good size. We went on a Friday and it was relatively quiet.",
          "We had a disappointing visit as the Impressionist paintings which we particularly wanted to see were out on loan so although the building is lovely and the exhibitions well set out overall it was a disappointing visit and not really memorable at all.",
          "To spent couple of hours at this museum was of a great pleasure. I believe that you have to make a choice. The museum is to large to pretend to visit all the rooms in one time. As usual we focus on the 20th century art and also end 19th-early 20th centuries objects (\"art",
          "One the best art museums, it gets you an overview of art from ancient Egypt to contemporary art. Useful free app, which works fine on iPhone but not on Android. Carte Musee is worth buying you stay longer in Lyon: for the price of 3 entrances you get 1 year access to 6 museums,",
          "The Musee des Beaux-Artes is a lovely large museum housed in a former Benedictine convent from the 17th and 18th centuries. Beautiful architecture. Lots of ancient Egyptian artifacts. Almost an entire floor devoted to sculpture. Many coins and metal objects. Lots of older",
          "If you are in Lyon, you should make time to visit this museum for an hour or so. There are some terrific sculptures in an adjoining chapel, and a few wonderful Impressionistic paintings. We rented the audio guide but I would advise you to skip it as it wasn't that great. Just",
          "This is a beautiful building inside just architecturally, built around a lovely inner courtyard filled with sculpture, many of them pieces by Rodin. The sculpture collection inside, in the basement, is what drew me, especially, with many pieces from the late 19th and early 20th",
          "One of the most frustrating things about visiting Lyon is the real lack of tourist information. I did lots of research before we went there ,mainly looking for michelen star restaurants but also for cultural activities. I ordered and returned three guide books . which looked",
          "Housed in a lovely building with a shady garden the art collection is amazing. All the pictures were well presented- I loved the 20th century gallery. The ceramics collection was great too, especially the Islamic section. A lovely way to spend a few hours. It is also open on",
          "Inexpensive and spent two hours pottering around here whilst it was raining outside. An amazing selection of artists from around the world are represented so some famous names as well as more obscure and very old items. Huge place and didn't manage to see everything but well",

          "A stunning collection of old and reasonably new art pieces. First there is a relaxing inner courtyard which we did not take time to sit and relax. It is definitely worth seeing.",
          "The Musee des Beaux Arts is in a magnificent 17th century building which was once an abbey and the collections are exhibited in over 70 rooms. The five departments illustrate more than 5,000 years of art history: antiquities, decorative arts, coins and medals, 14th-20th century",
          "I find this museum disappointing. No specific angle, no personality, the art pieces are old, ok, but the explanations are rather boring. However, the entrance patio is beautiful and soothing, a great place to rest a bit.",
          "Love art galleries and thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this one. We were lucky enough to be here at a time when there was a special exhibit. The time flew by and the art was fantastic,",
          "This is an excellent provincial museum that can't be compared to the Louvre but has a fine collection nonetheless though a spotty one. I have my doubts about the early Rembrandt, but there are lovely works by Joos Van Cleve, Barthel Bruyn, Berthe Morisot, Tintoretto, Rubens,",
          "I visited the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts and bought a youth ticket, which from memory was 4-6 euros. The museum was really good for the price, with a huge range of works from the ancient to the modern. Highlights for me were the Egyptian section and the exhibit on artists from Lyon,",
          "Yes, there are some amazing Rubens but they compare this museum to the Louvre and it falls short. We should of waited a day and visited on Jour de Patrimonies, the 17 of September when it is free. IT DOES OF COURSE HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF WONDERFUL WORKS OF ART, but don't compare",
          "We spent a couple of hours discovering fantastic paints and sculptures. The price isn't that high regarding what we saw and learned. Definitely recommend if you visit Lyon",
          "Beautiful venue in an 17th century convent, remarkable array of art from Egyptian to impressionism. Disappointed that the chapel was closed. Had a simple brownie snack in the restaurant that includes an outdoor area overlooking lovely courtyard with Rodin sculptures. Audio guide",
          "The museum is near the Hotel de Ville metro, in a lovely square with fantastic buildings. The museum is divided into a floor devoted to ancient arts (Egypt, Roman etc), and the second floor has paintings and sculpture-- heavy on the French, but a good selection dating from 1200",
          "A beautiful museum with a wonderful collection of impressionist art. There were no crowds on the Friday that we visited so it was a pleasure to view the art without interruption. The museum is housed n a lovely building with a beautiful courtyard garden. Well worth a visit.",
          "If you are in Lyon this is worth a stop. I took a guided tour in English and my guide really made the art come alive. The collection of art from 1870 on is breathtaking. I also liked the Art Nouveau decorative objects. Also, they are open until 6 pm (18 h) which gives one a",
          "The museum was a very worthwhile stop in our walking tour. There were many well displayed collections of Egyptian, Greek, and Medieval art, plus several periods of French history.",
          "We were particularly impressed by the collection of paintings across the centuries on the top floor and the statues in the basement. The cafe is expensive.",
          "This museum isn't huge, but it's the best organized one I've been to in a while. The layout of the rooms takes you from early Egyptian artifacts right through to 20th century art, with some beautiful pieces from the Roman, Greek, Persian, medieval periods. It really helps to",
          "The building itself is worth the visit. The collections range from amazing to OK. Audio guides are so helpful in understanding many periods and pieces of art. Considerable care has been taken in arrangement of art.",
          "There could be more explanations about artworks, especially paintings. The Building and garden of the museum were so charming. A nice place to visit.",
          "With antiquities, sculpture, paintings from more than 5 centuries, coins and furniture there is something in this large collection to appeal to anyone. For me the sculpture collection (in the beautiful former chapel) and Impressionist Rooms were the best. The courtyard, shady",
          "Great place to see some of the most beautiful art on offer. It houses and extensive collection including works from Monet, Turner, Gauguin, Rubens and Picasso. Cover charge from 8\u20ac depending what you would like to see. TIP! Go early and start from the top where the lift takes",
          "Not only an excellent collection of works by well known artists incl. Rodin, Monet, Manet amongst many others but a superb building in its own right. Worth a few hours and the entrance fee is good value.",
          "We spent a couple of hours visiting the Musee des Beaux-Arts during our stay in Lyon, lovely place to visit if you have the time",
          "The musee's collection of paintings is truly stunning. A lot are focused on New Testament era events . Renoir and Monet are also included. Worth a visit for sure.",
          "A varied and interesting classical collection well displayed. Lighting was very good and all the paintings were labeled. I did not use the audio guide and it was nice to move around at my own pace.",
          "This is a stunning museum that was established in 1801! It features art and antiquities gathered during the French Revolution and put on display for the regular citizens of France. The paintings are arranged by era and style and take you on a pleasant stroll through a palace",

          "Loved this place! I'm not really a person for art museums but it was very nice. It wasn't very busey even on a Saturday at the beginning of August. It is a place I would like to see again (a rare honour for museums in my books)",
          "You enter across a large central courtyard of grass and trees, ideal perhaps for staff breaks? My 2016 Guidebook quoted 7Euros admission with free audioguide but the ADM was 8 and audioguides (not even mentioned at the pay desk) another Euro! All too frequently the audioguide",

          "Checked this museum out and were pleasantly surprised by the lovely courtyard. Kids under 18 got in free. While there are an enormous number of paintings which aren't the world's greatest, everything is beautifully displayed, and there were a few things which really stood out.",
          "Visited twice as it's too big to have done it in one go! Great collections ranging from ancient egpytian artifacts to paintings. Lovely gardens too.",
          "Imposing building and amble display rooms. Much fine art over many centuries. Exceptional sculpture. Lighter on modern and contemporary art. Somewhat eclectic.",
          "Museum was good - most interesting parts were: Rodin sculptures, some Impressionist paintings (Pissarro, Monet, and Sisley), Salle des Fleurs (very realistic paintings of flowers), and a lovely courtyard. Unfortunately, the entire first floor was closed during our visit for not",
          "This was my absolute favorite museum that I visited in Lyon. The collection is wonderful. I don't think this museum gets near the credit it should. Make sure to catch the selfie exhibit, it was really well curated. Also, I was blown away by Louis Janmot's work.",
          "We were there for the self-portrait exhibit, which was great. The regular museum paled somewhat, and really had nothing outstanding once you have been to other big museums. Really excellent coin and medallion collection, that would be what I would pick as their biggest. Boring",
          "very nice collection of sculptures and an impressive courtyard ... the way the at is presented is a little bit old-fashioned and the modern art part comes too short , all in all worthwhile to see",
          "Beautiful. Can be pricey as it's split into different sections. Well worth a visit. Easy to find...with its own tea shop. Cheapest entrance to one part was \u20ac9",
          "My wife and I are museum goers. But the experiences at Paris or Florence often overwhelmed us because of the crowds. This Museum while its so sizable has just the right atmosphere for a quiet museum visit. Incredible collections by French and Italian artists. Only wish there",
          "Given the fact that Lyon has fewer than a million inhabitants, this museum is impressive-particularly for its rather substantial collection of antiquities (Egyptian, Greek& Roman). We were not over-awed by the art work, but clearly that's a matter of taste.",
          "We had planned to only spend a couple of hours at this museum but ended up spending most of the day. There is a wide variety of artwork well displayed and the layout of the building is such that its hard to get lost. I also enjoyed the Egyptian exhibits. We had lunch at the",
          "Very Huge! You have to plan several hours. Art from 3000 B.C. until 21st. Century! One of the most important museum in france.",
          "Took our young daughter here as part of a short break in Lyon and really enjoyed it. Spent a couple of hours enjoying the art and sculptures. Great presentation and history.",
          "We only had time to view paintings on the upper floor. While I enjoyed it I was really grateful for the donation which gave the Museum some lovely twentieth century pieces though sadly some of these were on \"holiday\" at an exhibition in Mexico. The paintings by local artists",
          "We went on a wet day and spent over 4 hrs there. Lots to see: paintings, sculptures and museum pieces from around the world. Very quiet, so no difficulty in seeing all the pieces you are interested in without someone blocking your view. Trying to see everything in detail could",
          "After visiting the museums in Paris including the louvre, D'Orsay, Picasso, Pompidou unfortunately most other museums fall far short, hence my three star rating. However, for those who have not seen the top museums, this is a very nice museum,",
          "The museum is located in a beautiful old, palatial abbey, the building alone is worth a visit with sweeping staircases and a central serene courtyard. We were there to see the 'Self Portrait' exposition which was.a great collect of pieces though the ages. I also enjoyed some of",
          "It a great museum in terms of european and local (Lyon) art. All the collections is installed in a historical building that is a attraction too. There is a good cafe there. and beautiful terraces, besides a interesting garden.",
          "Visited a coup,e of times including one time with my 10 year old. We both very much enjoyed the first two levels of the museum but the painting area had a lot of dark and depressing material. Our favorite area was the sculpture zone. A lot of fabulous art pieces including",
          "We managed to see almost all of the museum in one visit, but would be less fatiguing to make two visits - well worth it. Unlike the Louvre, which is overwhelming, this museum is more manageable. Fantastic collection of statues - a feast for the eyes. Impressive ancient",
          "Wonderful collection of artwork ranging from paintings, sculptures to currency. I recommend visiting during one of the musee nocturne nights and enjoy the various performance that are located throughout the venue. A great place to spend an evening with friends.",
          "Small but good museum with a wide range of exhibits. Almost one of every type.. Fantastic statue of a fisherman with casting net in marble",
          "Lyon is a smaller city than Paris, but very similar. The Musee des Beaux-Arts contains art from centuries ago through modern art. I would recommend the audioguide and plan on several hours to enjoy the museum. There is a cafe in the museum, but you can also go out to a nearby",
          "This substantial (but not overwhelming) museum has many magnificent pieces by famous artists. They are well grouped and presented in roomy spaces making it easy to navigatied around the collections with relative ease. We were fortunate to also view the impressive \"selfie\"",
          "This exhibit only lasts until June 16 it includes the self portraits from Rembrant to Matisse to Munch to Mapplethrope. There is no English speaking audio but the captions are in English. The Rembrant's alone are impressive.",
          "This is a manageable size museum that one can do in a day. Offers a variety of modern, classical, impressionist and Antiquity art. Has an extensive collection of coins. Child friendly, has a special audio tour for kids. Loved the Rodin garden and the room with middle eastern",
          "I enjoyed the art, the history and the new exhibition on self portraits. An improvement would be increased information written in English, which could be having translations under the French signs, or having a separate booklet. The city has many things set up to encourage and",
          "We went to the museum to see the exhibition about Autoportraits. It is really interesting and it is worthy. We went for a couple of hours and we spent more than 4 hours. They have many cultural activities like music, dance, ...",
          "This really is a gem of a museum. Beautifully curated, it has some amazing art. Some by artists you will know (Monet, Gaugain, Sisley, Rodin) and some by local Lyon artists. Its all good. The Egyptian galleries are particularly pleasant as well. Its had some serious",
          "We've been overwhelmed by the Louvre too many times to count so went here with some trepidation. We were pleased to find a great collection in a manageably-sized museum. We had a very limited amount of time but with their \"highlights\" brochure managed to see quite a lot. The",
          "As I like to visit different museums all around the world, I couldn't make an exception for Lyon. Musee des Beaux-Arts didn't disappoint me with its collection of paintings, statues and many small items of everyday life. Absolutely stunning!",
          "After spending time in Paris and seeing all that city has to offer I didn't know if I'll enjoy this museum. What a delight it was to spend a day and see amazing art work. I was not disappointed at all.",
          "Beautiful couryard that is accessible for free, usually packed during lunch time in the nicer weather. Check out the statutes there, or sit on the bench reading a book or eating lunch. Inside the museum is quite warm so better to leave your jacket at the provided place.",
          "Lovely cafe and great experience. As a lover of Rodin this was a must see place and the range is great. Lots of other excellent art too!",
          "painting ceramics coins glassware metalwork all well represented examples of paintings include Van Goch \"selfie\" Manet Renoir Beautiful Etruscan pots Islamic art ceramics all wellrepresented",
          "This is an amazing museum full of wonderful art and historical artifacts. We went during the nocturne event which occurs at night, and is hosted by students. Throughout the museum you will find performances ranging from musical, to interpretive dance, and informative",
          "Most descriptions throughout are in French so an audio guide may be useful for non French speakers. Suggest get a free map when paying admission as not all sections connect logically. Some quality pieces from Eygpt, a range of art masters' works and a few excellent sculptures.",
          "We spent a February morning in the museum, before heading off to a splendid lunch at Paul Bocuse's three-starred restaurant. The museum is well located, and attractive. We spent too much time (as it turned out) in the Egyptian and Greek antiquities sections, and so we had to",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this large and wide-ranging collection of art and antiquities. As one might expect, the museum houses exhibits of Gallo-Roman finds, which are quite impressive; but there is also an imposing Egyptian section, complete with monumental masonry.",
          "If you want to see very good examples of most periods of art, back to ancient Egypt and up to the present day, then this museum does it. The displays have been carefully selected so that one can take in what one has seen over two hours or so, and supply audio guides in many",
          "This is a wonderful museum. World class art works. We especially liked the art works of the 17th and 18th century",
          "Since you are in town, pay a visit and enjoy the exhibitions. Mind you that it's not the best of its kind, but surely worth a visit. Spare more time for the sculptures:)",
          "You can see there lot of paintings, sculptures and medals. Very big exposition of Egypt. Staff is not very friendly when you make a photos....",
          "My wife and I visited the museum expecting a significantly large exhibition of the Impressionist/Expressionists only to be disappointed in the very few that the museum had. We were led to believe by looking at the museum's web site that entire galleries would be devoted",
          "This is the 2nd place must be visited after the Church on the top of the hill, if you only have limited time - you should visit the church and this place.",
          "Really loved this museum and it's garden. We had the chance to visit it during winter, it wasn't crowded at all, we took a pause for lunch inside the museum and was pretty good.",
          "Not as impressive as \"le Louvre\" in Paris and much smaller, Lyon Mus\u00e9e des Beaux arts is really worth a visit : great paintings and sculptures exhibited in a Palace. The courtyard is free for a short break away from the turmoil of the city you can admire replicas of Rodin's",
          "We're told this is second only to the Louvre among Frances art museums. I won't rank them, but this was a wonderful collection. The paintings include a number of works by specifically Lyon artist, and it was a great opportunity to see works that might not make it to an",
          "Perfect if the weather is not good or you don't know what you want to do. Do not go to the main exhibit as it is in french and the audio guides are also in french. However, the museum is full of surprises even some monet and pissari. Free audio guides as well",
          "Very broad range and rich heritage of art and sculpture of high order. Unlikely to disappoint the art lover.",
          "A lot of things, but not easy to find your way around. Study the plan before visiting. It is a huge museum and you have to choose",
          "Unless you are going to see a specific display or exhibition, plan on spending a day to walk the entire museum. Maybe longer. Parking garage nearby is convenient.",
          "This place feels very clean and organized like every other art gallery but it's more than that. Their collection is large, as a Rodin lover my head was above the clouds during the 4-5 hours we've spent there. You can go visit the gallery with your friends or just by yourself. If",
          "Full of both history and art. Highly recommended and a great way to spend at least 2-3 hours. Audio guide helps but most of the collection information is in French",
          "I went here an hour before closing which was not enough time. They have a nice collection of art and well worth seeing.",
          "There was a complimentary audio guide with your entrance ticket which was much appreciated. Spent about 3 hours here and had a nice time",
          "You can take it all in and have a cup of tea in a half day or less. Great sculpture section, lovey ancient art, and a small window into Impressionism. There is also an impressive collection of coins and medals.",
          "Lyon's Musee des Beaux Arts is an excellent medium-sized museum. The spaces are very well-designed, and the collection is truly superb. The courtyard is also lovely, and the cafe and its terrace are a great spot for a coffee or a light lunch.",
          "Certainly for me one of the leading attractions of Lyons, with a five star collection of works of art.",
          "I think this museum is the perfect match for the city, it is very elegant and not overwhelmingly big. The museum collection is eclectic, it has Italian, Flemish, Spanish and of course French artists. The highlights are the painting of St. Francis made by Zurbar\u00e1n, one Gauguin,",
          "A visit here is like going through the whole of western civilisation in a morning. You set off with ancient artefacts and classical sculpture, progress via cunning bronzework to huge classical paintings that give me psychological indigestion (I prefer the earlier more",
          "After the Lourve the Museum of Fine Arts was a breath of fresh air. We actually had a chance to just sit and take in the artwork without being swamped with tourists. The size of the Museum also means its quite possible to see everything. The atrium courtyard was also great. Well",
          "I did visit this museum 45 minutes before closing time so I did not have much time to see even 30% of all collection. I have seen Flower's Room and the Egyptian Art Collection. Do not rush and enjoy it. Highly recommended.",
          "So much to see here. Give it at least half a day. Lovely collections and not crowded, which is a huge plus.",
          "Excellent museum in beautiful building that was a former abbey. Nice collection of statues, paintings from 14th to 20th centuries including many impressionist works.",
          "I went into this museum just as it was closing so I didn't see much. However, I had just enough time to quickly view the sculptures and the ancient egyptian sections of the museum. It was beautiful, well laid out and interesting. It is comparable to the louvre in Paris (but on a",
          "I went here on a rainy day and this is a great rainy day activity. The setting is spectacular. The collection is nice. All in all I found it very restful. Unfortunately the restaurant which is supposed to be excellent was closed when I visited. For a large museum it is very",
          "Don't get fooled by \"Second only to the Louvre\". The museum is nice and a few great pieces but that is all. Nonetheless worth seeing as you walk by.",
          "An exceptional collection beautifully presented in a classic building. We particularly enjoyed the sculpture gallery that was well complemented by the architecture. Great pieces with useful information supplied by the free audio guide. Could have spent the whole day here just",
          "We really enjoyed our trip to this fantastic art gallery. The rooms are very large and some of the pieces are amazing We went with two young children and they really enjoyed it. Their imagination ran wild. They lived rooms like the flower room and one with angels (they called",
          "Second only to the Louvre, the gallery contains some really excellent art from about 1400 a.d. Up to the present. The 19th and early century paintings are a good as anywhere else",
          "A nice mix of Renaissance through Impressionism. There was one Rembrandt and a couple of Monet, but a nice way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "We loved the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Lyon. There are a variety of exhibits from early antiqueties to 20c. art encompassing many of the periods in between. We spent most of the day here and still didn't get to see all that was on exhibit.",
          "The museum is on a massive scale and you really need the best part of a day to do it justice - and even then you will leave dealing! It's very 'French' in the content and display of the numerous exhibits.There's a clear chronology to the displays and plenty of space to view",
          "The featured exhibit that was going on while we were here was FANTASTIC!!! We were a little tired of the jesus paintings and marble sculptures as we were traveling for some time but the featured exhibit was so rich it's really a testament to the curator of this museum",
          "This is an excellent museum, with a good range of 19th Century paintings plus other bits and pieces. Unfortunately, the 20th Century room was closed, as the contents had been lent to another museum. Even so, it was worth a good couple of hours.",
          "Required to visit. The museum's collection is striking richness and diversity.The museum's collection includes Ancient Egypt, Rome, old and modern painting. Some of the exhibits leave unforgettable memories, this is a nice touch to the story.",
          "The building itself is quite historic and the plaza it sits in is very pretty. There's an attractive courtyard inside, and the art collection, while not world-class, is certainly interesting and gives you a regional flavor.",
          "I expected a bit more around the belle-epoque and the turn of the 19th to 20th centuries. A good museum rather for antiquities and a small handful of art from the mid-late 1800s. Found it strangely difficult to navigate, though it's basically an \"O\". (I didn't have a map cuz it",
          "My highlight of my trip to Lyon. An incredible museum full of treasures. The sculpture rooms in the lower floor were a special treat, as they were less busy (at one point I seemed to have the bulk of it to myself). Note that there is a partial closing in the early afternoon,",
          "Grabbed an audio guide and explored the museum. Fascinating and informative and all based in an amazing building. Definitely worth a visit when in Lyon.",
          "We loved this museum and the lack of crowds made it far more enjoyable to visit than the Louvre or other, more prominent museums. There is a superb collection of impressionist works and the museum itself is delightful - particularly the walled garden at the entrance. If you",
          "This beautiful building is adjacent to the stunning Hotel du Ville and houses some spectacular art and sculpture. As a huge fan of Rodin, I was in absolute heaven as there were so many examples of his work. The impressionist section is worth a look, but there were some",
          "I liked the impressionist section of paintings and also some of the sculptors. Entance fee was not expensive.",
          "An excellent visit. Allow quite a bit of time. A half-day would do. You can pick and choose by historical era, from ancient Egypt to hyper-modern. We really liked the 18th -20th century art.. It is often, but not always free to the public. It is included on the Lyon Carte.",
          "It is a great museum with precious collection. The building is also an art piece. The museum has a wonderful garden with statues by Rodin.",
          "Free to visit is always a bonus when travelling-but an added bonus to see the portraits and paintings of this gallery. Easy to get to, time spent depends on your interest. You could spend as little time or as much as you desire. The garden in the middle is also delightful. Take",
          "A lovely museum with a wide range of exhibits from ancient Egypt to impressionist paintings . Very doable in a couple of hours",
          "A fine museum of manageable size. Good selection of exhibits and paintings. The small restaurant on the terrace was a lovely place to pause for refreshment on the way round the museum.",
          "We visited this museum for a few hours. It housed various trypes of art from France. Not the best we have been to but worth a visit.",
          "An ok museum, mix of many different styles and periods, some interestic pieces et in the Egyptian part, overall rather a medium museum, there are not many explanations if you have no audio guide, not that impressive.",

          "DO IT! Even for non-museumy or severely vision-impaired people (eg my husband) it's a wonderful experience. Doesn't have the quantity of some of the great museums (Louvre, Hermitage, etc) but select thrilling masterpieces from top masters (Rodin, Brueghels et al) and very",
          "Someone rated this provincial museum one of the five best in France. They must have been dreaming! There are three or four wonderful pictures, a number of historical scenes by little known renaissance or baroque artists, and lots of forgettable local stuff.",
          "This is a wonderful museum filled with all types of work. There is something here for everyone to see. I loved the Egypt collection as well as many of the modern masters.",
          "if you are in lyon a MUST see. it has a beautiful collection of art thru the centuries and especially from the period whn lyon was a roman capital, But they also have beautiful art from the middle ages, middle east and contemporary. the restaurant is has a great balcony where",
          "We are not particularly \"arty\" types but enjoyed a wander around the exhibitions happily for a couple of hours on a Sunday afternoon. Housed in a large former monastery It contains both historical artefacts from the empires of Rome, Persia, Egypt, and Greece as well as paintings",
          "If you like art this is a great place to spend some time. Particularly liked the modern art collection. A surprising bonus is the lovely restaurant on a terrace overlooking the courtyard. Seemed very popular with the locals who clearly know a good thing when they see it.",
          "Highlights: Ottoman Empire Egyptians Modern Art Rodin. Low Lights. The terrace bar. Shame we ended our museum visit on such a sour note. We got seated for 15minutes. No menu No drink order Yet somehow, everyone who had a collared shirt got served before us. Pfffft. Avoid.",
          "This beautiful museum is a former 17th century Benedictine convent and has about 70 rooms packed with paintings by such artists as Rubens, Rembrandt, Gauguin and Delacroix, as well as exhibits from 14th to 21st centuries, sculptures by Rodin and Egyptian antiquities. It is free",
          "This museum has Egyptian to sculpture and impressionists . Plenty of spots to rest and really look. Pretty good audio guides. Not all numbers were available in English Just a polite apology . It s worth your time.",
          "We visited this museum in August 2015 as a part of our riverboat cruise of SE France. Surprisingly, compared to Paris' similarly-sized Musee d'Orsay, which is typically packed with throngs of tourists, the Beaux-Arts was a rewarding, comfortable experience, albeit with fewer",
          "We both thoroughly enjoyed visiting the museum as there is so much to see - antiques, objets d'art, glassware, medals and coins, old and modern paintings and sculptures and a nice shop. There is a cafe and restaurant which serves lovely food, and there is also a very nice",
          "Conveniently, in view of our advanced age, due to the refurbishment of much of the building, the 'gems' of the collection were housed in one set of galleries.",
          "This museum starts with Egypt and brings you forward in history with the art and archeology of subsequent civilizations. It has a surprising collection of archeological pieces from Egypt. Everything in this museum is top quality and worth seeing.",
          "We saved this museum for a rainy day, and we are very glad it rained. What a wonderful hall of treasures. Interesting collections at every turn. Well worth the discovery",
          "The location and the building are beautiful. The museum is not that big and within 2 hours you've seen the whole collection. The layout of the museum was at start somewhat confusing and no english extended descriptions of the objects were present.",
          "Situated next to hotel de Ville in a grand old building entry down an arched corridor leads to a quiet green garden with Rodin statues and mosaic frescos. 7 euro , all day entry meant we could go out for coffee and come back for a second look. Free audio in English etc, but you",
          "A compact museum adjacent a popular square, some interesting collections, could be skipped if you are visiting Louvre.",
          "This museum is quite impressive, with a wide array of artwork. There's a lovely courtyard to the right as one enters. It's quite large, with lots of trees and benches and sculptures. There are several religious-themed paintings which are not \"our thing,\" so we moved through",
          "A comprehensive museum spanning the period from antiquity to modern art. It is compared favorably with the Louvre in Paris in the comprehensive collection.",
          "The museum is in a large attractive building near the Hotel de Ville. First of all we saw various sculptures (Rodin, etc.) before going to a very interesting modern art section. Exhibits include some good Picassos, at least two by Francis Bacon and some decidedly avant-garde",
          "The museum was disappointing given Lyon is France's second city and without the significant legacy of one individual who gave Bonnards and Picassos would have very little of mainstream interest, though there is a very lovely Zurbaran of St Francis of Asissi and also some",
          "I really wanted to like this museum, but the interior layout detracted from the art experience. Maybe just an off day for me. The gardens and cafe overlooking them are very lovely.",

          "This museum is housed in a former Benedictine Abbey which is worth visiting for its beauty alone! It also overlooks Place des Terreaux which must be one of the loveliest squares in Lyon with its spectacular fountain and beautiful buildings on all sides. There is an extensive",
          "The Musee has many good pieces of art, well laid out and easy to see. The cafe was very nice as it sits overlooking the courtyard. They bring you the actual chalkboard menu to your table to order. The food was very good, as were the drinks(beer, wine).",
          "Great collections from all eras housed in the superb Abbey right on Les Terreaux. Wonderful views of our favourite fountain in the square below from the higher levels.. Shops are shut on Sundays so this is a perfect outing for a Sunday morning - everything is quieter so you can",
          "In this case even the building itself with inside garden is a peace of art. It is not huge, i think couple of hours will be enough to inform yoursef. But if its a hot summer day, what can be better then spending a little bit more time in shadow of the trees in the yard, enjoing",
          "Very easy to get round, we started at the top and worked our way down because we wanted to see the art works first and knew we wouldn't see everything. The building its self is impressive and has a lovely garden as well as a terrace cafe. The staff are helpful and not too stuffy",
          "At only 7euro to get in, this is a real bargain museum to see. There is some great artwork (Monet, Renoire etc.), sculpture and decorative arts housed here. The museum is not so massive that it feels like a chore to get around, and it is really well laid out. I would take",
          "Well presented & impressive collection of art & sculpture. Also had lifts which is good as there are a lot of stairs ! We spent about three hours looking around & still didn't see all of exhibits",
          "Visited this museum several times before, last time about ten years ago. Has anything changed? I don't think so. It would help enormously if some translations were available to explain exhibits.",
          "They have a good collection of Impressionists and others. It is a large museum with a cafe and you can really spend time here.",
          "It's interesting and diverse...it covers many time periods and hoses some lesser known artists while having some beautiful paintings and sculptures of very well known artists. Tip...start at the top and work your way down. Make sure to stop in the cafe and get a drink and sit",
          "A lovely museum with a good collection of paintings and sculptures, most by lesser known artists but Van Gogh, Monet, Sisley, Matisse and Rembrandt are represented as well. Lots of enormous Italian renaissance religious art that holds no appeal for me at all, but some people",
          "An attractive and manageable museum with some great pieces. I would recommend pacing yourself so that you don't succumb to culture fatigue before you reach the best works, which are chronologically later. I was also surprised by how much I enjoyed the sculptures\u2013 not usually my",

          "I know little about fine art, but do appreciate famous works, especially if there is explanation. Brochure that comes with admission does have english, so I wasn't lost. It even provided highlight exhibits for those visitors with limited time and wished to get the most famous",
          "This is a very high quality museum with terrific collections of ancient Egyptian items and 16th through 20th century French paintings. Easy to view (you can get as close as you want to even the greatest artwork with no one hasseling you) with wide, uncrowded galleries. Also has",
          "The museum is housed in a lovely building, and has a secluded garden area within its grounds. The museum has interesting displays on a variety of cultures, statues etc eg Egypt, Roman,Greek. There is a large selection of paintings including Renoir, Monet, Degas etc. It is not",

        "wiki": "Lyon or Lyons (UK: , US: , French: [lj\u0254\u0303] (listen); Arpitan: Liyon, pronounced [\u028ej\u0254\u0303]; Italian: Lione, pronounced [li\u02c8one]) is the third-largest city and second-largest urban area of France. It is located at the confluence of the rivers Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne, about 470 km (292 mi) south of Paris, 320 km (199 mi) north of Marseille and 56 km (35 mi) northeast of Saint-\u00c9tienne. Inhabitants of the city are called Lyonnais.\nLyon had a population of 513,275 in 2015. It is the capital of the Metropolis of Lyon and the region of Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes. The Lyon metropolitan area had a population of 2,265,375 in 2014. The city is known for its cuisine and gastronomy, and historical and architectural landmarks; part of it is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Lyon was historically an important area for the production and weaving of silk. Lyon played a significant role in the history of cinema: it is where Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re invented the cinematograph. It is also known for its light festival, the F\u00eate des Lumi\u00e8res, which begins every 8 December and lasts for four days, earning Lyon the title of Capital of Lights.\nEconomically, Lyon is a major centre for banking, as well as for the chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotech industries. The city contains a significant software industry with a particular focus on video games, and in recent years has fostered a growing local start-up sector. Lyon hosts the international headquarters of Interpol, the International Agency for Research on Cancer and Euronews. According to the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute, Lyon is considered a Beta city, as of 2018. It ranked second in France and 40th globally in Mercer's 2019 liveability rankings.\n\n\n== History of Lyon ==\n\n\n=== Ancient Lyon ===\n\nAccording to the historian Dio Cassius, in 43 BC, the Roman Senate ordered the creation of a settlement for Roman refugees of war with the Allobroges. These refugees had been expelled from Vienne and were now encamped at the confluence of the Sa\u00f4ne and Rh\u00f4ne rivers. The foundation was built on Fourvi\u00e8re hill and officially called Colonia Copia Felix Munatia, a name invoking prosperity and the blessing of the gods. The city became increasingly referred to as Lugdunum (and occasionally Lugudunum). The earliest translation of this Gaulish place-name as \"Desired Mountain\" is offered by the 9th-century Endlicher Glossary. In contrast, some modern scholars have proposed a Gaulish hill-fort named Lug[o]dunon, after the Celtic god Lugus ('Light', cognate with Old Irish Lugh, Modern Irish L\u00fa), and d\u00fanon (hill-fort).\n\nThe Romans recognised that Lugdunum's strategic location at the convergence of two navigable rivers made it a natural communications hub. The city became the starting point of main Roman roads in the area, and it quickly became the capital of the province, Gallia Lugdunensis. Two Emperors were born in this city: Claudius, whose speech is preserved in the Lyon Tablet in which he justifies the nomination of Gallic Senators, and Caracalla.\nEarly Christians in Lyon were martyred for their beliefs under the reigns of various Roman emperors, most notably Marcus Aurelius and Septimius Severus. Local saints from this period include Blandina, Pothinus, and Epipodius, among others. The Greek Irenaeus was the second bishop of Lyon during the latter part of the second century. To this day, the archbishop of Lyon is still referred to as \"Primat des Gaules\".Burgundians fleeing the destruction of Worms by the Huns in 437 were re-settled at Lugdunum. In 443 the Romans established the Kingdom of the Burgundians, and Lugdunum became its capital in 461. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, Lyon went to the Holy Roman Emperor Lothair I. It later was made part of the Kingdom of Arles. Lyon did not come under French control until the 14th century.\n\n\n=== Modern Lyon ===\nFernand Braudel remarked, \"Historians of Lyon are not sufficiently aware of the bi-polarity between Paris and Lyon, which is a constant structure in French development...from the late Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution\". In the late 15th century, the fairs introduced by Italian merchants made Lyon the economic counting house of France. Even the Bourse (treasury), built in 1749, resembled a public bazaar where accounts were settled in the open air. When international banking moved to Genoa, then Amsterdam, Lyon remained the banking centre of France.\nDuring the Renaissance, the city's development was driven by the silk trade, which strengthened its ties to Italy. Italian influence on Lyon's architecture is still visible among historic buildings. In the late 1400s and 1500s Lyon was also a key centre of literary activity and book publishing, both of French writers (such as Maurice Sc\u00e8ve, Antoine Heroet, and Louise Lab\u00e9) and of Italians in exile (such as Luigi Alamanni and Gian Giorgio Trissino).\n\nIn 1572, Lyon was a scene of mass violence by Catholics against Protestant Huguenots in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. Two centuries later, Lyon was again convulsed by violence when, during the French Revolution, the citizenry rose up against the National Convention and supported the Girondins. The city was besieged by Revolutionary armies for over two months before surrendering in October 1793. Many buildings were destroyed, especially around the Place Bellecour, while Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois and Joseph Fouch\u00e9 administered the execution of more than 2,000 people. The Convention ordered that its name be changed to \"Liberated City\" and a plaque was erected that proclaimed \"Lyons made war on Liberty; Lyons no longer exists.\" A decade later, Napoleon ordered the reconstruction of all the buildings demolished during this period.\nThe Convention was not the only target within Lyon during the 1789-1799 French Revolution. After the National Convention faded into history, the French Directory appeared and days after the September 4, 1797, Coup of 18 Fructidor, a Directory's commissioner was assassinated in Lyon.\nThe city became an important industrial town during the 19th century. In 1831 and 1834, the canuts (silk workers) of Lyon staged two major uprisings for better working conditions and pay. In 1862, the first of Lyon's extensive network of funicular railways began operation.\nDuring World War II, Lyon was a centre for the occupying Nazi forces, including Klaus Barbie, the infamous \"Butcher of Lyon\". But the city was also a stronghold of the French Resistance \u2013 the many secret passages known as traboules enabled people to escape Gestapo raids. On 3 September 1944, Lyon was liberated by the 1st Free French Division and the Forces Fran\u00e7aises de l'Int\u00e9rieur. The city is now home to a resistance museum.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne converge to the south of the historic city centre, forming a peninsula \u2013 the \"Presqu'\u00eele\" \u2013 bounded by two large hills to the west and north and a large plain eastward. Place Bellecour is located on the Presqu'\u00eele between the two rivers and is the third-largest public square in France. The broad, pedestrian-only Rue de la R\u00e9publique leads north from Place Bellecour.\nThe northern hill is La Croix-Rousse, known as \"the hill that works\" because it is traditionally home to many small silk workshops, an industry for which the city has long been renowned.The western hill is Fourvi\u00e8re, known as \"the hill that prays\" because it is the location for Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re basilica, several convents, and Archbishop residence. The district, Vieux Lyon, also hosts the Tour m\u00e9tallique (a highly visible TV tower, replicating the last stage of the Eiffel Tower) and one of the city's funicular railways. Fourvi\u00e8re, along with portions of the Presqu'\u00eele and much of La Croix-Rousse, is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.East of the Rh\u00f4ne from the Presqu'\u00eele is a large flat area upon which sits much of modern Lyon and contains most of the city's population. Situated in this area is La Part-Dieu urban centre, which clusters the landmark structures Tour Part-Dieu, Tour Oxyg\u00e8ne, and Tour Swiss Life, as well as the city's primary railway station, Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu.\nNorth of this district lays the sixth arrondissement, which is home to one of Europe's largest urban parks, the Parc de la T\u00eate d'or, as well as Lyc\u00e9e du Parc and Interpol's world headquarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLyon has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), bordering on an oceanic climate (Cfb) due to the higher average temperature being around 22 \u00b0C. But in modified classifications such as that of Trewartha, France's third largest city has an oceanic climate (Do).  The mean temperature in Lyon in the coldest month is 3.2 \u00b0C (37.8 \u00b0F) in January and in the warmest month in July is 22 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Precipitation is adequate year-round, at an average of 830 mm (32.7 in), but the winter months are the driest. The highest recorded temperature was 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) on 13 August 2003 while the lowest recorded temperature was \u221224.6 \u00b0C (\u221212.3 \u00b0F) on 22 December 1938.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nLike Paris and Marseille, the city of Lyon is divided into a number of municipal arrondissements, each of which is identified by a number and has its own council and town hall. Five arrondissements were originally created in 1852, when three neighbouring communes (La Croix-Rousse, La Guilloti\u00e8re, and Vaise) were annexed by Lyon. Between 1867 and 1959, the third arrondissement (which originally covered the whole of the Left Bank of the Rh\u00f4ne) was split three times, creating a new arrondissement in each case. Then, in 1963, the commune of Saint-Rambert-l'\u00cele-Barbe was annexed to Lyon's fifth arrondissement. A year later, in 1964, the fifth was split to create Lyon's 9th \u2013 and, to date, final \u2013 arrondissement. Within each arrondissement, the recognisable quartiers or neighbourhoods are:\n\n1st arrondissement: Slopes of La Croix-Rousse, Terreaux, Martini\u00e8re/St-Vincent\n2nd arrondissement: Cordeliers, Bellecour, Ainay, Perrache, Confluence, Sainte-Blandine\n3rd arrondissement: Guilloti\u00e8re (north), Pr\u00e9fecture, Part-Dieu, Villette, Dauphin\u00e9/Sans Souci, Montchat, Grange Blanche (north), Monplaisir (north)\n4th arrondissement: Plateau de la Croix-Rousse, Serin\n5th arrondissement: Vieux Lyon (Saint-Paul, Saint-Jean, Saint-Georges), Saint-Just, Saint-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e, Fourvi\u00e8re, Point du Jour, M\u00e9nival, Batti\u00e8res, Champvert (south)\n6th arrondissement: Brotteaux, Bellecombe, Parc de la T\u00eate d'or, Cit\u00e9 Internationale\n7th arrondissement: Guilloti\u00e8re (south), Jean Mac\u00e9, Gerland\n8th arrondissement: Monplaisir (south), Bachut, \u00c9tats-Unis, Grand Trou/Moulin \u00e0 Vent, Grange Blanche (south), La\u00ebnnec, Mermoz, Monplaisir-la-Plaine\n9th arrondissement: Vaise, Duch\u00e8re, Rochecardon, St-Rambert-l'\u00cele-Barbe, Gorge de Loup, Observance, Champvert (north)Geographically, Lyon's two main rivers, the Sa\u00f4ne and the Rh\u00f4ne, divide the arrondissements into three groups:\n\nTo the west of the Sa\u00f4ne, the fifth arrondissement covers the old city (Vieux Lyon), Fourvi\u00e8re hill and the plateau beyond. The 9th is immediately to the north, and stretches from Gorge de Loup, through Vaise to the neighbouring suburbs of \u00c9cully, Champagne-au-Mont-d'Or, Saint-Didier-au-Mont-d'Or, Saint-Cyr-au-Mont-d'Or and Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or.\nBetween the two rivers, on the Presqu'\u00eele, are the second, first, and fourth arrondissements. The second includes most of the city centre,  Bellecour and Perrache railway station, and reaches as far as the confluence of the two rivers. The first is directly to the north of the second and covers part of the city centre (including the H\u00f4tel de Ville) and the slopes of La Croix-Rousse. To the north of the Boulevard is the fourth arrondissement, which covers the Plateau of La Croix-Rousse, up to its boundary with the commune of Caluire-et-Cuire.\nTo the east of the Rh\u00f4ne, are the third, sixth, seventh, and eighth arrondissements.\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nThe Roman ruins on the hillside near the Fourvi\u00e8re Basilica, with the Ancient Theatre of Fourvi\u00e8re, the Odeon of Lyon and the accompanying Gallo-Roman museum;\nAmphitheatre of the Three Gauls \u2013 ruins of a Roman amphitheatre.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===\nCathedral of St. John, a medieval church with architectural elements of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, also the principal religious structure in the city and the seat of the Archbishop of Lyon;\nBasilica of St-Martin-d'Ainay, one of the rare surviving Romanesque basilica-style churches in Lyon;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Paul, Romanesque (12th and 13th century) and Gothic (15th\u201316th century) church;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Bonaventure, 14th- and 15th-century Gothic church;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Nizier, Gothic church from the 15th century, having a doorway carved in the 16th century by Philibert Delorme;\nVieux Lyon (English: Old Lyon) area, Medieval and Renaissance quarter of the town, with shops, dining and cobbled streets;\nThe many Renaissance h\u00f4tels particuliers of the Old Lyon quarter, such as the H\u00f4tel de Bullioud, were also built by Philibert Delorme.\n\n\n=== 17th and 18th centuries ===\nCity Hall on the Place des Terreaux, built by architects Jules Hardouin-Mansart and Robert de Cotte;\nMus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Lyon, fine arts museum housed in a former convent of the 17th century, including the Baroque chapelle Saint-Pierre;\nH\u00f4tel-Dieu de Lyon (17th and 18th century), historical hospital with a baroque chapel;\nTemple du Change (17th and 18th century), former stock exchange of Lyon, Protestant temple since the 18th century;\nPlace Bellecour, one of the largest town squares in Europe;\nChapelle de la Trinit\u00e9 (1622), the first Baroque chapel built in Lyon, and part of the former \u00c9cole de la Trinit\u00e9, now Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Amp\u00e8re;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Polycarpe (1665\u20131670), Classical church;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Just (16th to 18th century), Classical church;\nSaint-Bruno des Chartreux (17th and 18th century), church, masterpiece of Baroque architecture;\n\u00c9glise Notre Dame Saint-Vincent (18th century), Neo-classical church.\n\n\n=== 19th century and modern city ===\nOp\u00e9ra Nouvel (1831), renovated in 1993 by Jean Nouvel;\nTh\u00e9\u00e2tre des C\u00e9lestins (1877), designed by Gaspard Andr\u00e9;\nBasilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re, large 19th-century basilica on the top of Fourvi\u00e8re Hill;\nTour m\u00e9tallique de Fourvi\u00e8re (1894);\nLa Mouche Cattle Market and Abbatoir (1914, 1928), designed by Tony Garnier;\nSainte Marie de La Tourette monastery (1960) designed by Le Corbusier;\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry International Airport (formerly Satolas Airport), designed by Guillaume Gilbert;\nGare de Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (1994) by Santiago Calatrava;\nPalais des congr\u00e8s de Lyon (1998), designed by Renzo Piano and a group of buildings for various functions;\nTour du Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais;\nTour Oxyg\u00e8ne;\nTour Incity.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Lyon (Fine Arts Museum), main museum of the city and one of the largest art galleries in France.

Located in the 6th arrondissement, it features a large lake on which boating takes place during the summer months.\nJardin botanique de Lyon (8 hectares), included in the Parc de la T\u00eate d'Or, is a municipal botanical garden and is open weekdays without charge. The garden was established in 1857 as a successor to earlier botanical gardens dating to 1796, and now describes itself as France's largest municipal botanical garden.\nParc de Gerland, in the south of the city (80 hectares);\nParc des hauteurs, in Fourvi\u00e8res;\nParc de Miribel-Jonage (2200 hectares);\nParc de Lacroix-Laval (115 hectares);\nParc de Parilly (178 hectares).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe GDP of Lyon was 74 billion euro in 2012, making it the second richest city in France after Paris. Lyon and its region Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes represent one of the most important economies in Europe and, according to Loughborough University, can be compared to Philadelphia, Mumbai or Athens with regard to its international position. The city of Lyon is working in partnership to more easily enable the establishment of new headquarters in the territory (ADERLY, Chambre du commerce et d'industrie, Grand Lyon...). High-tech industries such as biotechnology, software development, video game (Arkane Studios, Ivory Tower, Eden Games, EA France, Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe), and internet services are also growing. Other important sectors include medical research and technology, non-profit institutions, and universities. Lyon is home to the P4-Inserm\u2013ean Merieux Laboratory which conducts top-level vaccine research.The city is home to the headquarters of many large companies such as Groupe SEB, Sanofi Pasteur, Renault Trucks, Norbert Dentressangle, LCL S.A., Descours & Cabaud, Merial, Point S, BioM\u00e9rieux, Iveco Bus, Compagnie Nationale du Rh\u00f4ne, GL Events, April Group, Boiron, Feu Vert, Panzani, Babolat, Euronews, Lyon Airports, LVL Medical, and inter-governmental agencies IARC, Interpol.\nThe specialisation of some sectors of activities has led to the creation of many main business centres:\nLa Part-Dieu, located in the 3rd arrondissement is the second biggest business quarter after La D\u00e9fense in Paris with over 1,600,000 m2 (17,222,256.67 sq ft) of office space and services and more than 55,000 jobs. Cit\u00e9 Internationale, created by the architect Renzo Piano is located in the border of the Parc de la T\u00eate d'Or in the 6th arrondissement. The worldwide headquarters of Interpol is located there. The district of Confluence, in the south of the historic centre, is a new pole of economical and cultural development.\nTourism is an important part of the Lyon economy, with one billion euros in 2007 and 3.5 million hotel-nights in 2006 provided by non-residents. Approximately 60% of tourists visit for business, with the rest for leisure. In January 2009, Lyon ranked first in France for hostels business. The festivals most important for attracting tourists are the F\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res, the Nuits de Fourvi\u00e8re every summer, the Biennale d'art contemporain and the Nuits Sonores.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nSince the Middle Ages, the region residents have spoken several dialects of Franco-Proven\u00e7al. The Lyonnais dialect was replaced by the French language as the importance of the city grew. However some \"frenchified\" Franco-Proven\u00e7al words can also be heard in the French of the Lyonnais, who call their little boys and girls \"gones\" and \"fenottes\" for example.\nThe Lumi\u00e8re brothers pioneered cinema in the town in 1895. The Institut Lumi\u00e8re, built as Auguste Lumiere's house, and a fascinating piece of architecture in its own right, holds many of their first inventions and other early cinematic and photographic artifacts.\n8 December each year is marked by the Festival of Lights (la F\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res), a celebration of thanks to the Virgin Mary, who purportedly saved the city from a deadly plague in the Middle Ages. During the event, the local population places candles (lumignons) at their windows and the city of Lyon organizes impressive large-scale light shows onto the sides of important Lyonnais monuments, such as the medieval Cath\u00e9drale St-Jean.\nThe Saint Francis of Sales church is famous for its large and unaltered Cavaill\u00e9-Coll pipe organ, attracting audiences from around the world.\nThe Op\u00e9ra Nouvel (New Opera House) is the home of the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon. The original opera house was re-designed by the distinguished French architect Jean Nouvel between 1985 and 1993 and is named after him.\nLyon is also the French capital of \"trompe l'\u0153il\" walls, a very ancient tradition. Many are to be seen around the city. This old tradition is now finding a contemporary expression, for example in the art of Guillaume Bottazzi.\nThe Brothers of the Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic congregation that operates schools in Europe and North America, was founded in Lyon in 1821.\nThe African Museum of Lyon is one of the oldest museums situated in Lyon.\nThe Museum of Resistance and Deportation looks at the various individuals prominent in the Resistance movement in World War II. The building is strongly linked to Klaus Barbie. Lyon sees itself as the center of the French resistance and many members were shot in Place Bellecour in the town center. The exhibition is largely a series of mini-biographies of those involved.\nThe unusual project Lyon Dubai City, a reproduction of some districts of Lyon in Dubai, is a major point for tourism in Lyon.\nLyon is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission Intercultural cities program.\n\n\n=== UNESCO World Heritage Site ===\nThe Historic Site of Lyon was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998. In its designation, UNESCO cited the \"exceptional testimony to the continuity of urban settlement over more than two millennia on a site of great commercial and strategic significance.\" The specific regions comprising the Historic Site include the Roman district and Fourvi\u00e8re, the Renaissance district (Vieux Lyon), the silk district (slopes of Croix-Rousse), and the Presqu'\u00eele, which features architecture from the 12th century to modern times.\nBoth Vieux Lyon and the slopes of Croix-Rousse are known for their narrow passageways (named traboules) that pass through buildings and link streets on either side. The first examples of traboules are thought to have been built in Lyon in the 4th century. The traboules allowed the inhabitants to get from their homes to the Sa\u00f4ne quickly and allowed the canuts on the Croix-Rousse hill to get from their workshops to the textile merchants at the foot of the hill.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\n\nLyon has a long and chronicled culinary arts tradition. The noted food critic Curnonsky referred to the city as \"the gastronomic capital of the world\", a claim repeated by later writers such as Bill Buford.  Renowned 3-star Michelin chefs such as Marie Bourgeois and Eug\u00e9nie Brazier developed Lyonnaise cuisine into a national phenomenon favoured by the French elite; a tradition which Paul Bocuse later turned into a worldwide success.The bouchon is a traditional Lyonnais restaurant that serves local fare such as sausages, duck p\u00e2t\u00e9 or roast pork, along with local wines. Two of France's best known wine-growing regions are located near the city: the Beaujolais region to the north and the C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne region to the south.  Another Lyon tradition is a type of brunch food called \"m\u00e2chons\", made of local charcuterie and usually accompanied by Beaujolais red wine. M\u00e2chons were the customary meal of the canuts, the city's silk workers, who ate a late-morning meal after they finished their shifts in the factories.Other traditional local dishes include coq au vin; quenelle; gras double; salade lyonnaise (lettuce with bacon, cro\u00fbtons and a poached egg); and the sausage-based rosette lyonnaise and andouillette. Popular local confections include marron glac\u00e9 and coussin de Lyon. Cervelle de canut (literally, \"silk worker's brains\") is a cheese spread/dip made of a base of fromage blanc, seasoned with chopped herbs, shallots, salt, pepper, olive oil and vinegar.\nMore recently, the french tacos was invented in Lyon suburbs in the early 2000s and is now worldwide famous.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nLyon is home to the football club Olympique Lyonnais (OL), whose men's team plays in Ligue 1 and has won the championship of that competition seven times, all consecutively from 2002 to 2008). OL played until December 2015 at the 43,000-seat Stade de Gerland, which also hosted matches of the 1998 FIFA World Cup.  Since 2016, the team has played at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais, a 59,000-seat stadium located in the eastern suburb of D\u00e9cines-Charpieu. OL operates a women's team, Olympique Lyonnais F\u00e9minin, which competes in and dominates Division 1 F\u00e9minine. They are on a streak of 13 top-flight championships (2007\u2013present), and additionally claim the four titles won by the original incarnation of FC Lyon, a women's football club that merged into OL in 2004 (the current FC Lyon was founded in 2009). The OL women have also won the UEFA Women's Champions League six times, including the two most recent editions in 2018 and 2019. Lyon will host the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Semi-Finals as well as the 7 July Final at Stade de Lyon.\nLyon has a rugby union team, Lyon OU, in the Top 14, which moved into Stade de Gerland full-time in 2017\u201318. In addition, Lyon has a rugby league side called Lyon Villeurbanne that plays in the French rugby league championship. The club's home is the Stade Georges Lyvet in Villeurbanne.\nLyon is also home to the Lyon Hockey Club, an ice hockey team that competes in France's national ice hockey league. The Patinoire Charlemagne is the seat of Club des Sports de Glace de Lyon, the club of Olympic ice dancing champions Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, and world champions Isabelle Delobel and Olivier Shoenfelder. Lyon-Villeurbanne also has a basketball team, ASVEL, that plays at the Astroballe arena.\n\n\n=== Street art ===\nSince 2000, Birdy Kids, a group of graffiti artists from the city, has decorated several random buildings and walls along the Lyon ring road. In 2012, the artist collective has been chosen to represent the city as its cultural ambassadors.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of the city of Lyon proper was 491,268 at the January 2011 census, 14% of whom were born outside Metropolitan France.\n \n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and tertiary education ===\n\n\u00c9cole Centrale de Lyon;\n\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon\nEM Lyon (\u00c9cole de Management de Lyon);\nECE Lyon (\u00c9cole de Commerce Europ\u00e9enne de Lyon);\nInstitut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Lyon (Sciences Po Lyon);\nCPE Lyon;\nECAM Lyon (\u00c9cole Catholique d'Arts et M\u00e9tiers de Lyon);\nEPITECH;\nEPITA;\nENTPE (\u00c9cole Nationale des Travaux Publiques de l'\u00c9tat);\nESME-Sudria;\n\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts;\nE-Artsup;\nINSA Lyon (Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Lyon);\nPolytech Lyon;\nInstitut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group;\nISARA (Institut Sup\u00e9rieur d'Agriculture Rh\u00f4ne Alpes);\nInstitution des Chartreux;\nInstitut polytechnique des sciences avanc\u00e9es;\nUniversit\u00e9 Claude Bernard (Lyon 1);\nUniversit\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re (Lyon 2);\nUniversit\u00e9 Jean Moulin (Lyon 3);\nIAE (Institut d'Administration des Entreprises de Lyon);\nInstitut Sup'Biotech de Paris;\nCatholic University of Lyon;\nESDES Business School;\nIDRAC (International School of Management);\nWesford Graduate Business School;\nIFAG (Business Management School);\nInstitut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action;\nLe Lyc\u00e9e du Parc;\nLa Martiniere Lyon;\nWeb@cademie;\nCEESO (Centre Europ\u00e9en d'Enseignement Sup\u00e9rieur de l'Ost\u00e9opathie);\nBellecour, Ecoles D'Arts.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nThere are some international private schools in the Lyon area, including:\n\nCit\u00e9 Scolaire Internationale de Lyon or the Lyc\u00e9e de Gerland;\nIncludes the Section Japonaises (\u30ea\u30e8\u30f3\u30fb\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\u30e9\u30f3\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821 Riyon Jeruran Hosh\u016b Jugy\u014d K\u014d \"Lyon Gerland Japanese Supplementary School\"), which the Japanese Ministry of Education (MEXT) counts as a part-time Japanese supplementary school\nOmbrosa;\nInternational School of Lyon in nearby Sainte-Foy-l\u00e8s-Lyon;\nMontessori School of Lyon.\n\n\n=== Supplementary education ===\nOther Japanese supplementary schools:\n\nThe Association Pour le Developpement de la Langue et de la Culture Japonaises (ADLCJ; \u30ea\u30e8\u30f3\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821 Riyon Hosh\u016b Jugy\u014d K\u014d) is held in the Maison Berty Albrecht in Villeurbanne, near Lyon. It was formed in 1987. It serves Japanese expatriate children who wish to continue their Japanese education whilst abroad.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nLyon\u2013Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport, located east of Lyon, serves as a base for domestic and international flights. It is a key transport facility for the entire Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, with coach links to other cities in the area. The in-house train station Gare de Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry connects the airport to the nationwide TGV network. The Rh\u00f4nexpress tram monopoly links the airport with the business quarter of La Part Dieu in less than 30 minutes, and offers connections with Underground A & B, Tramway T1, T3 & T4, and bus lines. Lyon public transport Sytral offers a bus service, Route 47, that links the airport to Meyzieu where passengers can change onto Tram T3. The regular price of public transport is \u20ac1.90, as opposed to \u20ac15 one way for the Rhonexpress. In the suburb of Bron, the smaller Lyon-Bron Airport provides an alternative for domestic aviation.\nLyon has two major railway stations: Lyon Part-Dieu, which was built to accommodate the TGV, and Lyon Perrache, an older station that now provides mostly regional service. Smaller railway stations include Gorge-de-Loup, Vaise, V\u00e9nissieux, Saint-Paul and Jean Mac\u00e9. Lyon was the first city to be connected to Paris by the TGV in 1981. Since that time the TGV train network has expanded and links Lyon directly to Perpignan, Toulouse, Nice, Marseille, Strasbourg, Nantes and Lille. International trains operate directly to Madrid, Barcelona, Milan, Turin, Geneva, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Brussels and London.\nThe city is at the heart of a dense road network and is located at the meeting point of several highways: A6 (to Paris); A7 (to Marseille); A42 (to Geneva); and A43 (to Grenoble). The city is now bypassed by the A46. A double motorway tunnel passes under Fourvi\u00e8re, connecting the A6 and the A7 autoroutes, both forming the \"Autoroute du Soleil\".\nLyon is served by the Eurolines intercity coach organisation. Its Lyon terminal is located at the city's Perrache railway station, which serves as an intermodal transportation hub for tramways, local and regional trains and buses, the terminus of Metro line A, of the Tramway T2, the bicycle service V\u00e9lo'v, and taxis.\n\nThe Transports en commun lyonnais (TCL), Lyon's public transit system, consisting of metro, tramways and buses, serves 62 communes of the Lyon metropolis. The metro network has four lines ( A   B   C   D ), 42 stations, and runs with a frequency of up to a train every 2 minutes. There are five Lyon tram lines ( T1  T2  T3  T4  T5) since April 2009: T1 from Debourg in the south to IUT-Feyssine in the north, Tram T2 from Perrache railway station to Saint-Priest in the south-east, Tram T3 from Part-Dieu to Meyzieu, Tram T4 from 'H\u00f4ptial Feyzin Venissieux' to Gaston Berger. Tram T5 from Grange Blanche, in the south-east to Eurexpo in the south-wast. The Lyon bus network consists of the Lyon trolleybus system, motorbuses, and coaches for areas outside the centre. There are also two funicular lines from Vieux Lyon to Saint-Just and Fourvi\u00e8re. The ticketing system is relatively simple as the city has only one public transport operator, the SYTRAL.\nThe public transit system has been complemented since 2005 by V\u00e9lo'v, a bicycle network providing a low-cost service where bicycles can be hired and returned at any of 340 stations throughout the city.  Borrowing a bicycle for less than 30 minutes is free. Free rental time can be extended for another 30 minutes at any station. Lyon was the first city in France to introduce this bicycle renting system. In 2011 the Auto'lib car rental service was introduced; it works much the same way as the Velo'v but for cars.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Lyon on a weekday is 45 minutes. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 17% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.7 km, while 4% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLyon is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission \"Intercultural cities\" program.\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nLyon is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGallia Lugdunensis\nList of movies set in Lyon\nList of people from Lyon\nList of streets and squares in Lyon\nM\u00e8res of France\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website(in French)\nVisit Lyon, the official website for tourism in France\nLyon Tourist Office and Convention Bureau\nLyon\u2019s English Language News and Information",

          "At first I could not believe that the displayed items were really from actual sets in the movies. And I learned a lot from the descriptions. Some of the displays are not for the faint hearted and children but they warn beforehand. Worth a 1.5-2 hours of your time. Money well",

          "My wife and I were blown away by this incredible private museum and we are not cinema buffs. Be prepared for some stair climbing but absolutely worth it. You could stare at just one of the miniatures for hours and there are hundreds. Located directly behind the Lyon Palais",
          "You really do need to allow yourself lots of time to fully appreciate the exhibits and building, we were in there for about 3 hours and still could have stayed longer. We echo the comments of the other positive reviews. Excellent value for money and highly recommended. Another",
          "The museum is really cool and they have various classic movies and new movies props. All of the props in the museum are all original props from the movies. Either the movie was made in Lyon or the creator of the item is from Lyon. Either way, everything that is displayed is one",
          "The museum was quite a fun experience as it held actual props used in a lot of major and very popular movies. The first floor is quite eerie. The next few floors after that are very interesting as you see all the little props and creatures used for movies that most people have",

          "Absolutely loved this museum. Fabulous collection of film and tv memorabilia. All I would say is I feel that having the miniatures at the end meant that I didn\u2019t appreciate them as much as they deserve as I had spent a long time looking at the cinema props by that point. They",

          "This museum looks tiny and kitsch from the front entrance but it's a trove of original movie and TV props, costumes, maquettes, miniatures and prosthetics from a host of well known productions - all originals used during production. It's set over several floors in a typical old",
          "This museum is a nice diversion from the ancient architecture and history of Lyon, pulling you from Roman times to Star Wars with side trips to eras in between. I particularly enjoyed the sets reconstructed from the movie \"Parfume, History of a Murder\" that were scented with",
          "Wow this is an amazing little museum. They've got all kinds of props, heavily from the 90s and early 2000s. Mrs Doubtfire's latex mask, tons of Aliens props, models of ships. It's an awesome little break in Vieux Lyon - you can do it in 45 minutes or spend hours there.",
          "We came upon this wonderful little gem while exploring Vieux Lyon on foot during a hot summer day. Coming from Los Angeles, I didn\u2019t expect to find so many amazing movie props and special effects in Lyon, France, of all places. But the museum didn\u2019t disappoint. It was a fun",
          "Enjoyed the museum. Could be boring if you're not into films and props, however it was amazing seeing the props from the films of our childhood, like Mrs. Doubtfire's mask. And the miniatures are amazing, the level of detail!!",
          "Thought this was just going to be a series of miniature set marvels including theatres, which were all there. But there is much more...lots of props and masks galore, highlighting the skills of the prostethic make up industry. The Mrs Doubtfire mask was the highlight for me.",
          "The museum is amazing! The cinema section was wonderful, but the miniature section really swept me off my feet. It was wonderful and insanely detailed. I kept seeing new details in each piece and was really shocked how real the settings seemed!",
          "An unexpected visit in a museum, but what an interesting theme of a place. We definitely were in awe of the over 100 miniature scenes that were done so intricately. For a cinema buff, there is a collection of costumes, robots and film props that were quite interesting. Nice",
          "A great collection gor movie buffs of all ages. Gadjets, props and real drawings and scripts from movies. A walkthrough area dressed exactly like the movie \"The Parfumer\". Probably better for kids over 10 years of age. Plan for at least 1 hour/1 hour 30 mins visiting time.",
          "Seems to be a bit random of a museum in Lyon but well worth the visit. Lots of intersting pieces and the miniatures are unbelievable",
          "The museum is very fun and has great pieces across the film industry. My favorite part was looking at all the miniature set designs with my daughter, who just graduated with a degree in theater and costume design. Fair warning, the exhibits are accessed by stairs over three to",

          "I am a movie lover and enjoyed most parts of the film props on the lower levels, but was amazed by the miniatures on top level. So realistic and neatly done! Recommend this place!",
          "Had some interesting pieces but could use a little AC.... it has a number of individual pieces to some interesting American movies. The larger rooms are French movie based",
          "We had really no high expectations going in. Our teenagers are the sweetest things and actually like walking around in museums and stuff. But you know, sometimes you just have to be sweet back and let them look st something they might like. That was our thought walking in. But",

          "We visited this museum some years ago and said if we are ever in Lyon again we will go a second time and so glad we did as it's amazing. So clever especially the miniature room settings as if like me you are a fan of dolls houses you cannot not be impressed. Whoever thinks the",
          "Since the weather was really nice I wasn't sure I should go inside the museum but I am so glad I did. It is a really nice museum of you are interested in movies and cinema. It displays set design, costumes, props,miniatures and much more from different movies throughout time.",

          "More a collection than a museum , but love of the cinema is the underlying and unifying theme . In the early days of cinema , it was often easier and cheaper to build ( usually ) a 1/12 model of the scene , and then superimpose the actors using blue screen technology . In fact ,",
          "This museum has a nice collection of various quintessential elements of movie making industry, that are always near the camera, but never on screen (like the script for the opening scene of Sixth sense. You will see some iconic masks (Jim Carrey, terminator, Ring, terminator,",
          "We were told there were props from many US movies that ended up in this museum. They were easy to identify. We learned the owner started collecting props after restoring The Alien but really you want to go for the miniatures. Very impressive.",
          "The movie props were great and covered so many famous movies! However, the miniatures were the most impressive part, despite the fact that they offered no English captions. Also, the person at the ticket office spoke no English, which made it hard for us to communicate.",
          "Don't overlook coming to this fascinating museum with so many miniature scenes of familiar places and movies.",
          "so so so cool. I went in just for the miniatures, didn't realize how many props there would be and was blown away. Even though you're in France and even if you're not a huge movie person it is so easy to recognize most of the movies. the miniatures are super interesting as well!",
          "Exhibits that any movie buff would love. We had read about this museum but forgot about it until we happened to walk buy it. The ticket was inexpensive and it took a couple of hours to walk through. The architecture of the museum is great. The exhibits are well thought out",

          "Although it might not seem like the most obvious museum choice when in Lyon, my husband and I really enjoyed our visit. The movie memorabilia and the miniatures are both great but for me the the highlight was definitely the miniatures. If I did the museum over again, I'd move",
          "This museum was entered on a whim and it was nothing what we expected it to be. If you're a fine of movie special effects before the computer age, this is the one museum you can't miss. It's also much larger than it appears.",
          "There is actually an interesting connection between the miniatures and the cinema: the proprrietor/miniature-maker was a set designer. The miniatures are an absolute marvel and would be well worth the price of admission even if the museum included nothing else. The collection of",

          "This gem of a museum is in the old town part of Lyon, so readily accessible. It includes movie costumes, props, models, animatronics and tricks of the trade. Although some of this has now been superseded by CGI it is still great to see how the special effects of yesteryear were",
          "This is probably the most entertaining museum I\u2019ve been to. I would not describe myself as a movie fanatic but I thought it was awesome! So cool to see all the movie props and learn about special effects and such. I was completely blown away by the miniatures on the top floor.",

          "The last thing I want to do is to visit museums when I go to a city. I entered this museum to pass time while waiting for a breakfast place to open. It was amazing! I'm neither a movie nerd nor a fan of museums, but the exhibition was very interesting. It is written that the",
          "Not to be missed, all the movie props and special effects are amazing, a big highlight of our holiday! I will mention it was quite crowded, annoying, but still not to be missed. There is a lift to all floors, and there is a bathroom as well.",
          "A caveat to this review - I had time to spare and the museum is included in the Lyon City Card, so I went in not entirely sure what to expect. In that context, it wasn't really for me. If you have a particular interest in movies I can imagine you'd take something from it.",
          "Pretty cheesy/tourist trap sort of museum. Most of the movie stuff is from older movies. The Alien queen was my favorite. Fun to walk around for a quick look but not a place I\u2019d care to visit again. The miniatures on the top floors were very interesting however. Glad I got",
          "Amazing place, not what we expected at all! It's nice and close to the old town, if you like movies or cinema it's very interesting. Even for families or kids it can be interesting. Worth visiting!",
          "An amazing museum especially if you are interested in films and special effects. There's even the REAL Alien Queen. The minature room sets are out of this world too.",
          "This is a wonderfully quirky and special museum that the kids adored. The trouble is when they put up a notice saying \"Don't take your kids in here\", the children are inevitably curious, you think well, it can't be that bad, andthey end up having nightmares about aliens and",

          "We did not expect it to be so fantastic but it is utterly unmissable- will go AGAIN if we are in Lyon. The cinematic memorabilia is excellent and the miniatures are to die for; if you like detail; excellence; magic- this is a place to go. The museum is housed in a beautiful old",

          "An interesting little place, worth a stop in especially if you have kids. The miniatures are very interesting if you\u2019re a film buff. An odd museum to have in the center of Lyon but definitely worth a quick glance if you need to get out of the heat.",
          "If you\u2019re into movies or miniatures, this is the place to visit!

          "If you are a fan of miniatures, this museum worth a visit. It's not something spectacular, but we had a good time, spending a bit more than an hour there. We got in using the Lyon City Card, so we paid no ticket. There are stands from many films and you will love them depending",

          "This place is a hidden gem! We were not sure what to expect when we got the tickets. I was as excited as a little toddler by the end of the trip. The place is a perfect place to reminisce about all the movies you have watched and having the real-life set figurines, is magical!",

          "It was quite busy which made it difficult to see much of the models. Pushchairs are not allowed so don't go with a sleeping baby. The models are very detailed and it's fun to try to spot the special figures and the Mr Men. My husband found the red light district complete with",
          "Following our visit here today I can see why this is a top Lyon attraction. The film exhibits were really interesting and the children (5 and 7) especially loved the miniature scenes. The perfect family activity for a rainy day!",
          "Visited on a family ticket and thought it was great value at \u20ac8 per adult and \u20ac5 per child. So much to see and take in. Lots of our favorite films were represented (as well as some we\u2019d never heard of but art is still art and fascinating) and it kept going and going on up.",
          "There was plenty to see here for us all (Parents and a teenager). Props, costumes, movie sets etc - from movies and TV shows. Some were more familiar than others. My favorites included Charlie Chaplin\u2019s walking stick, and the hover board from Back to the Future 2.",
          "We came there, 4 students The price is 9e for an adult, and 6.5e for a student. That's a bit overprice for what it is, to my eyes. We stay around 1h to 1h30 and we saw and read nearly everything. Lots of things were not that interesting, because they have lots of things from",

          "This is more of a \"movie museum\" then just miniatures. Sci-fi movie fans will go crazy in here. There is Back to the Future orginal hover boards. Batman. Predator. Aliens. All kind of spaceships. Fighter jet from Top Gun. And a lot more. Go check it out!",
          "I thought this hotel might be a big silly, but it was pretty astounding to see the miniatures, props, costumes etc... that are made and used for the filming of movies. I was surprised to see and learn what was real and what was miniature in some of my favourite movies!",
          "Spent a good hour or so here.. The movie memorabilia is interesting but the sets and in miniatures are worth the visit alone. If your a movie buff and want to see costumes..models then worth a visit",
          "An excellently put together museum. Lots for everyone to see. The film sets are wonderful as are the costumes but the best in the museum has to be the moving model \"Alien\" even though it hasn't been fully renovated yet. The miniatures are exceptional and such a surprise to see",
          "You have to visit. It\u2019s so interesting. I don\u2019t want to say too much about it as you have to visit yourself, but there\u2019s so much film set props and it\u2019s so interesting to see miniature sets that have been used on screen",

          "Lyon is, basically, a mini-Paris sans museums. Among six local museums this one was the best. It is also very conveniently located in the old quarter. Scenes from the movie \"Perfume\" are wonderfully reproduced, including the scents. Many other excellent miniatures from",

          "The Musee is really split into three sections. Section 1reproduces full size sets from a period film, starring Dustin Hoffman, about the early creation of perfumes. The sets are excellent and being full size allows for careful inspection. Section 2 contains examples of weapons,",
          "We had purchased a Lyon Pass and were close by so thought we may as well have a look at this Museum. We were so pleased that we did. There are 8 sections and each one was amazing. The original costumes, sets & special effects from movies were so interesting to see up close and",
          "Loved this museum and am still blown away by the miniatures. They are quite incredible. In the old time with lift across if required as it goes up seven stories. Great pieces from numerous famous movies - including Alien, Star Wars and more. Enjoyed this museum more than",
          "Not what you would expect for a museum in Vieux Lyon but a respite from history and a film lovers delight. Great movie props, masks, and miniature scenes from a wide gamut of films from the past 30 years.",
          "We saw this location and the flyers peaked our interest so we decided to visit the museum. We were greeted by the artist as we entered which was a delightful experience. The miniatures were amazingly detailed and the movie memorabilia was entertaining. An impressive collection",
          "Strangely this fascinating museum does not show up on the top places to visit in Lyon. If you have any interest at all in movies, you will love the exhibits which are mostly of American films. It shows just how movies are made with a great history of special effects.",
          "It\u2019s always a good idea for film fans to learn how the movies are done, in terms of costumes and miniatures, but this museum might surprise you, especially if you\u2019re a Harry Potter fan! Go and see for yourself!",
          "Read about this museum before we arrived and wanted to make sure we went. It was fantastic. Many, many move props and the miniature rooms were spectacular. Full sized sets for the movie Perfume were also wonderful. Highly recommended.",
          "Wow, what an amazing place. We just discovered this museum while we were in Lyon and it is definitely one of the most amazing and important attractions of this great city. Everything is very well-explained and the miniatures developed by the owner are amazing. It deserves a",
          "We took our American visitors; the adults and the children aged 6 & 8 were fascinated with it all! It is great to see all the movie props and costumes but the miniatures on the top floor were incredible!",
          "Astounding talent and the miniatures are a unbeatable visual representation of many places ! The cinema special effects part is great too and shows how much work goes into all the scenes and masks, costumes, etc. An entertaining few hours!",
          "Really enjoyed this museum. Well worth the few Euros & an hour of your time to see the miniatures & the movie memorabilia.",
          "Learned a lot of stuff with the audio guide. Very interesting, i'm sure a lot of people didn't know the Story of the 2 brothers",

          "Forget culture, my nine year old daughter loved seeing \"Chuckie\" and \"Samarra\". She flipped on the \"Alien Queen\". Although the crowds can be a bit much, once you get away from the crowds, it is a pleasant trip down memory lane with some old favorite movie props.",
          "Being a fairly small museum suited the incredible miniatures on display, the workmanship was wonderful. A nice touch was the step in front of the models to enable small children to see them properly. The movie sections were like a Planet Hollywood on steroids, lots to see and",
          "This is a 'must see' museum for any miniature and model making enthusiast. I was a hobbyist interested in dolls houses before I visited there over 10 years ago, and came out discovering that my hobby could be a serious artistic venture. I've since visited there every few years",
          "This museum is a refreshing break from other painting/sculpture art collections. It's not that big so it's also manageable and not too overwhelming. Here you'll learn about special effects, see costumes used from popular films and see AMAZING miniature work. The detail in",
          "quite an experience. As part of the Lyon City Card entrance was free, without it, I might have missed this little gem. Life-like reconstruction of the movie set Perfume by Patrick Suesskind. Lots of small sets, rooms, shops. Great for the entire family.",
          "Really enjoyed this. Had no idea that so much of a lot of films is shot in miniature. Very informative and interesting, for film lovers in particular. The miniatures are absolute works of art and the artists so talented. Well worth the entry fee!",
          "The museum has many original props from the actual movies. Also very interesting facts and information about the technology used in animation and creating special effects. They also have miniature sets which are very beautiful to see. The ticket for adult is 9 euro but there are",
          "This place doesn't look much from the outside but is a bit like Dr Who's Tardis! Think it is located on 4 levels. It has a lift but not sure it goes to all floors - check if you have mobility issues. Entry is \u20ac9 per person. Not only does it have fantastic miniature/models but",
          "Wow. It was a pleasure to visit this museum. We thought it is something that children only would enjoy. But as adults we were so fascinated that we spent much more time than we expected here. The time and effort it takes to create these scale models is amazing. Every bit of",
          "There is a part which is very interesting about the sets, where they explain how they shoot miniatures. I found the body parts (accessories) hilarious (so funny from up close). Although the alien queen is quite scary but very interesting.",
          "This museum has miniature sets that some have been used in movies but part of its main attraction are the costumes, sets and scale models of spacecraft. If you purchase the Lyon card, all museums are included. This museum was in the heart of the old town, Vieux Lyon so you can",
          "Any cinema lover should go. Anyone who does not care about cinema should go as well. Great and authentic costumes, props and sketches from famous movies",
          "I sort of stumbled upon this museum and ended up just going in and buying a ticket, very glad I did! Such a hidden gem in Lyon and can spend a decent amount of time in there. The miniatures section is quirky & wonderful. Lots of cool movie props, etc. Highly recommend- they also",
          "We came mainly for the special effects exhibition. They were very interesting for adults and children alike. Some areas were sealed off with a warning for sensitive visitors, but that seemed somewhat excessive - at least for anyone interested in special effects. What we really",
          "The cinema part was quite educative however the miniatures were really exciting. Displays works of many different artisans so variety is very satisfying.",
          "We spent a lot more time at this museum than I expected. The collection is much bigger than we expected and very interesting. We especially enjoyed the miniature collections on the top two floors. A really enjoyable visit!",
          "Great experience, not only because I'm a huge movie fan (and you can experience a lot of displays and special effects), but also because I love watching the tiny objects (such as shoes or pastries smaller than a third of my little nail!). One of the most interesting place I've",
          "There are multiple individual dioramas made with amazing detail, as well as a large number of movie memorabilia displayed on several floors of the Museum.",
          "I would recommend this museum for everyone: film buffs, fans of special effects, children or people who watched Alien one hundred times :) The museum is full of ORIGINAL items used mainly in pre-production fase. It explains what a meticulous work is put into the seventh art",

          "We were on a whistle stop tour of old Lyon with no time to go around but we still enjoyed the outside architecture and history of how this small private museum came about",
          "It was very nice to explore the old building which was turned to a museum. So many stunning settings to see, together with props and behind the scene stories.",
          "This is a must visit. Situated in Vieux Lyon you could miss it if you're not careful. What a thrill. The models themselves are brilliant. The information etc is fascinating . If you like cinema and /or models and costumes you will be entranced by this museum. A bonus is that it",
          "The artwork in miniature is spectacular. Just for that it is worth a visit. Then all the bits and bobs and scenes from a host of famous and not so famous films is really fantastic.",
          "I did not like Lyon, but I did very much enjoy this museum. It gives you a look into making movies and tv series, special effects, masks, costumes and similar stuff. For movie geeks and just average tv watchers. The top floor was not interesting though",
          "Amazing, brilliant, fantastic, I\u2019m a huge movie buff, but even if you aren\u2019t it\u2019s spectacular, this is one of the best places I\u2019ve ever visited and it\u2019s worth every centime of the 9\u20ac entry fee. The miniatures are just mind blowing with attention to detail, I couldn\u2019t help taking",

          "After exploring the main attractions of the city, i took a walk at Vieux Lyon and visited the miniature museum. It was a splendid choice since with only a minor entrance fee, i got to travel in various dimensions and various worlds. Although i wasnt interested for the content of",
          "I found the part with cinema costumes less interesting then the part dedicated to miniatures. I also enjoyed the scenography from \"the Perfume\" movie. I would recommend the place to cinema fans but mostly to miniature lovers. The visit should take about an hour.",
          "It's a place to visit if you want to know movie customs and scenarios, it's really surprising found out how many things are doing. For sure, you need time to go to all the stages but it worth it",
          "Fun, especially for a film buff like my husband. The Alien Queen is brilliant. Beautiful miniatures too",
          "I was just walking along the Old Town and I stumbled upon this. I remember a friend mentioned it so I went inside. Thankfully I get free entrance because I had the Lyon City Card. At first I thought I would breeze through this museum but I found myself enjoying each exhibit.",
          "I went thinking it would be miniatures and saw all these movie collectibles. It was pretty cool. Worth a visit.",
          "Dan Ohlmann did a great job , everyone must see the museum. The best part is the magnificent miniatures he made himself",
          "A museum with miniatures of cinemasets. Very interesting and fun. You recognises most filmes and the miniaturework is amazing. Very horrifying room with sets from the film \u201cAlien\u201d and \u201cthe perfume\u201d. You can spend 1 to 2 hoursin the museum",
          "If you have a lot of time to spend in the city or if it is raining it is nice to go there. However, nothing special, nothing typical from Lyon.",
          "I admit being a cinephile ... but wow ! this museum is one of the best I have visited in a long time. Looking at it from the street, I would never have expected what I found inside. First, it has some amazing original items, second, it is much bigger than you would expect. You",
          "Private museum with extensive collection of cinematic curiosities. Definitely worth visiting. You will see the world of cinema with very different eyes after a trip to this museum.",

          "A very nice \"promenade\" in this small world. Every scenic place is so real that we found we are geants instead of this is so small.",
          "We happened to stumble on this venue, and loved it! You can go inside for free to see a very very small selection of what to expect, and you will be mesmerised by the details of the miniature scenes and models they have on display at the entry. After paying to enter, we",

          "The place was very well organized. You just had to follow a path through several levels without knowing when the exhibition would end, in a good way. Lifts were available for those who need that. The movie memorabilia were well worth seeing but we thought the miniatures were",
          "This museum was the the highlight of our trip to Lyon. It is full of the most amazing props, scenes and models for movies you will ever find. Beats the hell out of \"Hollywood on the Gold Coast\" and even the studio tour in Hollywood itself. The incredible amount of work and",
          "Permanent exhibition is quite interesting but I particularly enjoyed the temporary exhibition about \u201cma vie de courgette\u201d an absolutely fantastic French stop motion movie. The building itself is beautiful and characteristic of this old part of town.",
          "An enchanting experience. The exhibits are across several floors but a large lift connects all floors-no problem for pushchairs or wheelchairs. I was intrigued by many of the exhibits. I think children would get bored with some of them quite quickly but for people with a longer",
          "The passion of the creator of both the miniatures and the museum is clearly evident in this wonderful stop. The recreated sets of the perfume movie (don't remember the name) were fascinating and incredibly detailed, and these were only the beginning. Anyone with an interest in",

          "If you enjoy movie memorabilia, then this place is a must-see. Multiple floors of props, sets, and interesting behind-the-scenes facts. Some exhibits may not be suitable for young children, and the museum gives warnings as such, but overall this would be a fun place for families",
          "The movie props were a tad dated, but the miniatures were fascinating. I would recommend it for a low key attraction.",
          "It was the miniatures in the window that caught our eye as we wandered by. We thought the movie memorabilia would be like other memorabilia stops but it was so much more. The collections were sorted by different roles in the movie making process and it was quite extraordinary.",
          "The bulk of the place deals with costumes from movies, which interesting in itself is not the main attraction to this place. The top floor is dedicated to miniatures which are truly amazing. The details to some of these are amazing and can't be initially appreciated. As I",
          "Not really my thing, but theirs no denying the mastery that's required to make these creations. If you like Monroe props, particularly monsters and Gould, you'll love this!",
          "This place is amazing - don't walk past it if you are in Vieux Lyon! Unassuming from the outside, it has a rich display inside. One of their specialities is miniature scenes that were made up and used for a range of movies. The attention to detail in these scenes is unbelievable",
          "This museum is situated in a historic building in Vieux Lyons. It contains some very atmospheric sets from the film Perfume on the ground floor. Elsewhere there is a variety of props and costumes from different films. There is also a large collection of the models made for the",
          "Several floors of static exhibits with nothing personal. Lots of props and miniatures from B and C level films dating to the 80s until about 2008. It doesn't incorporate any CGI so it is a bit dated but still interesting.",
          "This museum located in the heart of Vieux Lyon is easy to miss since it's located in the middle of a beautiful cobble stone street full of restaurants and stores -- but don't miss it! This gem of a museum is as fun to see as it is to navigate -- up and down 7 or so floors some",
          "We went there this yearbook but intend to visit again. If you like miniature or doll's house this place is a must. Also for film special effects and sets it is worth visiting. With or without children this place is worth a visit.",
          "My hubby is a pretty big movie fan, and as we got access to the museum through our city pass we decided to check the place out. It was surprisingly large (8 floors) and had a sizable collection of artifacts from both famous and less well-known films. Loved seeing the Gremlin,",
          "I took my visiting family composed of youngsters of 5 and 8 years old and another one 16 yrs, plus the parents and me the old chat above 65 yrs. I can tell you everybody enjoyed the two parts of the Museum (the cinema part and the miniature exhibits). The miniature rooms are so",

          "Excellent place. Lots to see with many very hard to come by exhibits. Most models look well preserved. More importantly, there are sympathetic, friendly and helpful guides working there. My trip there was the highlight of my stay in Lyon which confirms the popular opinion",
          "We found this museum by chance, and were not disappointed. it was really interesting and definitely worth going!",

          "As I was travelling with a film fanatic this was a must for him but it was beyond my estimations, with 7 rooms of film memorabilia and an amazing collection of handmade miniatures, something different for everyone. A must see-but take heed of the no kids signs on some areas - a",

          "A must-see in Lyon! We originally expected this to be a bit of a time-wasting stop, but were absolutely blown away by the detail in the \"sets\" on the top floor of the museum. The craftsmanship and attention to detail is something you must see. It's also quite cool to see Dan (the artist) walking around answering questions!",

The mini artwork are also extremely detailed and for sure will blow you away!",

        "wiki": "Lyon Cathedral (French: Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Lyon) is a Roman Catholic church located on Place Saint-Jean in Lyon, France. The cathedral is dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, and is the seat of the Archbishop of Lyon.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe cathedral was founded by Saint Pothinus and Saint Irenaeus, the first two bishops of Lyon. The cathedral is also known as a \"Primatiale\" because in 1079 the Pope granted to the archbishop of Lyon the title of Primate of All the Gauls with the legal supremacy over the principal archbishops of the kingdom. It is located in the heart of the old town (Vieux Lyon) and it backs up to the Sa\u00f4ne river, with a large plaza in front of it and a metro stop nearby providing easy access to and from the city center.Patiens of Lyon, who was bishop about 450, built a new cathedral, dedicated to Saint Stephen. Later, in the seventh century, a baptistery dedicated to Saint John was constructed as an accessory building to the church. The Church of St. Croix was also near. This location later became the site of the Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Jean-Baptiste.In 1245, the cathedral hosted the First Council of Lyon.In 1819 J. M. W. Turner sketched a study of the Cathedral as seen from the heights of the Fourvi\u00e8re Hill. Edgar Degas used the cathedral for the setting of his painting \"Ceremony of Ordination at Lyon Cathedral\".\n\n\n=== Festival of Light ===\nEach December, Lyon holds an annual Festival of Lights. The tradition dates to 1643, when on December 8, the people of Lyon would place a lit candle in the window, a custom still maintained by many residents to this day. During the Festival, a choreographed lighting display appears on the fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral.\n\n\n== Description ==\nBegun in 1180 on the ruins of a 6th-century church, it was completed in 1476. The building is 80 meters long (internally), 20 meters wide at the choir, and 32.5 meters high in the nave. The apse and choir are of Romanesque design; the nave and fa\u00e7ade are Gothic.\nNoteworthy are the two crosses to right and left of the altar, preserved since the Second Council of Lyon of 1274 as a symbol of the union of the churches, and the Bourbon chapel, built by the Cardinal Charles II, Duke of Bourbon and his brother Pierre de Bourbon, son-in-law of Louis XI, a masterpiece of 15th century sculpture.\nThe cathedral also has the Lyon Astronomical Clock from the 14th century.\nThe cathedral organ was built by Daublaine and Callinet and was installed in 1841 at the end of the apse and had 15 stops. It was rebuilt in 1875 by Merklin-Sch\u00fctze and given 30 stops, three keyboards of 54 notes and pedals for 27.\nUntil the construction of the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re, it was the pre-eminent church in Lyon.\n\n\n== Organists in residence ==\nEdouard Commette - most of the first half of the 20th century.\n\n\n== Burials ==\nCardinal Foulon\nCardinal Gerlier\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAssociation Cath\u00e9drale de Lyon Primatiale Saint John n.d.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBasilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re\nBasilica of Saint-Martin d'Ainay\n\u00c9glise Saint-Paul\n\n\n== References ==",

          "It is a beautiful, unique experience to enjoy this old cathedral dedicated to Jonh, the Baptiste. Dominating a pleasant plaza at the end of narrow medieval streets, the well-preserved temple fa\u00e7ade invites you to recall the austerity of late Romanic architecture and the next",
          "This cathedral is well worth a visit if you walk by. It dominates the plaza. When we went in we were almost the only people there, which made it much more special. A great place to spend a bit of time away from the crowds.",

          "Cathedral Saint Jean is a beautiful cathedral with stained glass windows around the altar and throughout the church. The stained glass near the altar is traditional while many of those on the side are modern. There is a beautiful large clock in the upper left side of the church.",
          "While much more austere than its younger sibling on the Fourviere hill, the Cathedral of St Jean is a wonderful building that was constructed between the 12th and 15th centuries. The site has hosted a Christian community since the 2nd century and the remains of two previous",

          "Very nice church in Vieux Lyon. Has a very interesting astronomical clock. While it will not compete with many of the big name cathedrals throughout Europe, it is definitely worth a visit. It is also beautiful to view the exterior of this cathedral at night, both from the",
          "This was a very beautiful church with some really cool gargoyles. I don't actually think we were supposed to be in the church when we were but they didn't say anything just locked the door after we left. The clock inside was really awesome as well. We didn't spend a lot of",

          "The architectural elements, superb interior decorations make this cathedral an destination in itself.",
          "Yes it is not the basilica, but it is worth stop to see. The church is in the heart of the old town of Lyon with a large open square in the front and it\u2019s back to the Sa\u00f4ne river. A metro stop is not far away. The architecture is stunning. My wife and I were both captivated",
          "Escape from the city, from time, from space: enter the cathedral and admire the colours of the windows. Don't forget to have a close look at the astonomical clock!",
          "Another loss after what I'm sure was a gorgeous church was ruined by the reformation. Now it is undergoing restoration. Be sure to look at the astrological clock, even though it isn't working it is still cool.",
          "This cathedral in Vieux Lyon is unmissable. It has beautifully preserved carving around the doorways and an interesting astronomical clock inside. Sadly the clock was not working because of some repairs which were taking place inside the church when we visited.",
          "The church\u2019s architecture is gorgeous. The details on the building and inside are beautiful. There\u2019s like a square where the church is at so there\u2019s lots of shops and restaurants. And if you go up higher, the basilica will be at the top of Lyon.",

          "When we were there, most of the church was covered in canvas and scaffolding, and hammers were pounding away, so not the serene environment one expects in a church. The clock, attacked by the crazy iranian guy a few years ago, is still not repaired. I was told by the man at the",
          "Ok so it's not the Basilica, but this is a great visit in its own right and has some of the best stained glass windows you'll ever see.",

          "We are glad we walked in. As we approached the church, which is easy to reach on foot, we saw several armed military or law enforcement people on duty. We weren't sure what was going on but they didn't stop us. There was no entry fee and no one was on duty at the doorway. This,",

          "Lyon Cathedral is light and bright, which makes a great change from many Cathedrals in France. There is a very interesting astronomical clock, which is well worth seeing.",
          "There are restauration works going on, which does not really help, but its interior is quite poor, other than an amazing astronomic clock (not functioning until the end of the works). The glass windows are mostly modern abstract....not my style, I'm afraid",
          "... is to attend a celebration! We were there during Easter and thoroughly enjoyed this marvel of architecture in its prime destination.",
          "We attended mass here on Easter Sunday. The cathedral was packed with many having to stand in the aisles. The organ sounded wonderful.",
          "Nice old gothic church in the old town. The inside architecture is fairly simple but still worth a short visit. The outside of the church is very nice. Allow around 15 minutes for the visit.",
          "it took almost 3 centuries to build this gorgeous cathedral which is located at the heart of the Renaissance neighborhood of Saint Jean. The astronomical clock is pretty incredible.",
          "On a recent day of walking Lyon,we stopped here at the Cathedrale. When you walk in you are in awe of the history of the building you are walking in. Looking around at the crypts and the huge organ in the back of the cathedrale. Just thinking of the history of all the people",

          "We didn't realize how beautiful the inside of this church was going to be. The gold used in the paintings and just the paintings themselves were amazing. Very busy though so plan your trip to avoid the crowds.",
          "Just outside vieux lyon station... there's a beautiful old clock inside the cathedral. Good to have a look if u pass by.",
          "Initially a tourist guide brought us here to show us the Astronomical Clock, which is undergoing repairs but should be working by 2020. We went to Sunday morning Mass which took 1 hr 15 minutes, complete with singing. We could not understand most of it as the amplification was",
          "Built around 1180 on the site of an older church it is very interesting and historical. It houses an amazing astronomical clock and is located in the Place Saint Jean in Old Lyon. Under renovation is still well worth the visit.",
          "There is a lot of Cathedrals in this world; so the competition is hard. From my point of view this is an average one and unfortunately the inside were under reconstruction when I was there - so difficult to really judge this place.",
          "Even more impressive at night time!!! Look out for some Roman ruins and the sight of the original first cristian church just outside the Cathedral!!! A must do!!!",
          "Saint-Jean Cathedral dedicated to John the Baptist stands on the site where the religious buildings were before. Saint-Jean is an important Cathedral of France. Many important events took place here. For instance, the enthronement of cardinal Richelieu, and earlier the wedding",
          "We finished a walking tour where it began at the cathedral. It has a very lovely exterior on the remarkable town square. It is a centerpiece of the Vieux Lyon. Unfortunately while we could assess what was finished, there interior is being restored so much of it was covered in",
          "A typical cathedral like any other. Stones an high ceilings. Not my cup of tea but it\u2019s a bit cool to realize this being built in year 830-834. 4 years is a short time for such a huge building.",
          "Due to internal and external work a lot of scaffolding so unable to see full extent of building but still beautiful nonetheless",
          "We did not know anything about this place walking in - other than that it was highly rated on Tripadvisor and was also an excuse to ride a funicular - but we're always curious to see the local cathedral in new cities. This one now rates near the top of our list. Soaring marble",
          "Begun in 1180 and finished in 1476, this is well worth a visit. The exterior shines after a thorough cleaning. The interior cleaning is probably 60% done. The back end of the church is shrouded for work. Beautiful stained glass. The modern altar is very elegant. The astronomical",
          "The cathedral is under construction at the moment we visit. Pity because it looks like a beautiful Cathedral. Of course I compared with the Basilique Notre Dame De Fourviere the landmark of Lyon. If you do this then i would say that this cathedral is just a standard cathedral.",
          "This Cathedral has been fully and accurately described and photographed in many previous reviews. If you have been walking the old town and your legs are tired and your feet are sore, I recommend the stone seats along the front entrance of the Cathedral. Find a shady spot, sit",
          "This is definitely worth a visit while in the old town. it is relatively small for a cathedral and that makes it quite charming. It does not seem to get too busy either.",
          "this Cathedral is across the river from the main Plaza, a few minutes walk. the day we went they was some sort of artwork festival going around the outside of the church so it was very busy all around it. The tramway is also very close to this church Inside is is beautiful",
          "At the moment much of the interior is in in scaffoding -but it is still woth the visit both for its interior, the magnificent stained glass which is very old and its place in the history of France. It was also the site of the Council of Lyons which played an impotant role in the",

          "If you don't come to see this church for any other reason, it must be the clock. I don't even remember what ancient century the tour guide said it was from - guessing 14th.... But it is amazing. Swiss movement but all the moving parts that react at different times from the",
          "Part of our walking tour while in Lyon. You had access and could walk throughout the Cathedral. Glimpses of its past beauty and grandeur.",

          "The facade of this cathedral is the best feature. Take time to stop and look at some of the detail. Some nice photo ops. We didn't see the interior at its best because both sides were covered with scaffolding and plastic sheeting. What we could see, though, looked nice.",
          "There was very little to see inside the cathedral due to it being swathed in cloths while renovation is taking place. it is possible to see the astronomical clock but it will not be working again for quite a long time.",
          "Beautiful building in the heart of old Lyon. Plenty of restaurants and bars nearby to sit and contemplate the moment.",
          "Well worth a visit, especially take a look at the treasury with some old vestments and old church articles.",
          "While strolling the city I went to the old town area. Went into the cathedral to pay my respects to this treasure. Not my first visit. Try to stop in whenever I am in town. Always a pleasure it is still in place and well treated.",
          "The stained glass and side altars of this church are very nice and worth the visit. The stained glass has detailed explanations along the adjacent columns. The central altar and background are minimalist as if the backdrop was out for restoration... What i saw was worth a 3 or",
          "As part of our walking tour, we went to the Cathedral - we were told lots of interesting facts about the Madeleine stories on the exterior by the front doors - also about the clock inside. There is lots of restoration work being done, which, when finished will, no doubt, be",
          "A beautiful cathedral that is currently under partial renovation. But still a wonderful place to visit. We were fortunate to arrive while an organist was practicing. The organ music added to the spectacular setting. It seems the clock is not working during the renovation period.",
          "Luckily we took the time to see inside this cathedral. A great deal of history and a very interesting clock. We were lucky enough to have the organist rehearsing. Beautiful sounds.",

          "The highlight of my visit was getting into this cathedral. Lovely to see inside and just walk though and take it all in. It towers over lyon at night and looks so majestic when lit up.",
          "Sure hope the officials can control graffiti better in the future. When it's all over beautiful monuments, it stops being \"street art.\"",
          "We happened into the cathedral on Ascension Thursday and were surprised that Mass was going on! (We could not find a mass on Sunday when we were in Burgundy!) The building is beautiful, but hearing Mass and meeting the bishop were more thrilling an experience for me.",
          "Had a quick look, but compared to the two others which we visited in Lyon, this one just couldn't compare. Still, glad to have been it.",
          "A beautiful Cathedral in a beautiful square. The Cathedral is undoing renovation but is still wonderful.",
          "There is nothing special about this cathedral maybe because it is still under renovation. It is also dark inside. The plaza outside the cathedral is beautiful.",
          "Even though it is undergoing significant restoration, the quiet grandeur shows through. The astronomical clock is very interesting and the rose windows are lovely. The golden glow of the stone sets the mood.",
          "I am not Catholic or particularly religious but this cathedral is breathtaking. It is still under renovation or I would have rated it a 5. It is in the heart of Vieux Lyon as you walk down cobblestone streets. Don\u2019t miss it. An emotional and memorable experience.",
          "This cathedral is being beautifully renovated. Do not let the construction stop you from visiting. The work is carefully masked off and will not interfere with your visit. The front part of the church looks complete. On the contrary, you can see what the cathedral must have",
          "For a quick visit only from the outside, the cathedral of John the Baptist has one of the nicest architecture of any building I have ever seen",

          "The Cathedral is worth visiting on top of Fourviere Hill. You can use various forms of public transportation partially or all the way to the top. We rode the funicular to the Roman ruins and then walked the rest of the way. In addition to exploring the ruins and Cathedral, you",
          "Outstanding experience of prayer in beauty! The cathedral is in the center of such a beautiful part of Old Lyon! Whether you are there for spiritual reason, or just for the beauty, it is worth it. There is a museum attached to it where relics of Saints are kept. There\u2019s also a",

          "Very impressive building, a display of the richness of old inhabitants and donors. A good example of French art.",
          "We timed our visit to coincide with the builders in early January, not advisable as the tranquility of this place was destroyed by their moving of scaffold poles. That being said the stained glass windows and the astronomical clock were magnificent",

          "The Cathedral of Lyon is just mesmerizing. I can just sit on the side of the water fountain in front of it an admire the architecture and beauty of the church. Not to mention that the whole block where it is located is very charming. All the restaurants seems to offer great",
          "Although not as ornate as the Norte dame the cathedral offers a sanctuary for thought and contemplation. The mix of modern and ancient windows allow a beautiful setting and the astronomy clock although currently not working is a beautiful site.",

          "This is the heart and soul of the old town of Lyon. If you visit Lyon, this is a place you should visit. It\u2019s right in the center of the old town and right next to the metro station, and it\u2019s an easy place to get to. On the other hand, it wasn\u2019t the most beautiful cathedral we",

          "This cathedral has interesting stained glass windows. You can stay longer time just staring at them.",

          "Probably the best cathedral in the worl as mix of several gothic styles as long as roman features. Outstanding clock if you patient round the clock as long as awesome pieces of architecture in the middle of Old town classified for yeARS by UNESCO tribute. Just too much",
          "Very plain compared with the higher Cathedral but with still plenty of charm and history. The videos playing throughout showing film of various features of the church were excellent.",
          "Placed in the old town, this is a very nice example of romantic style, with some influences of early gothic elements both inside and outside the Cathedral. It is definitely worth a visit.",

          "In this city of churches, this church is definitely one to see. The architecture, stained glass, and artwork are wonderful. The cathedral sits at the base of Fourviere hill in the very old section of Lyon. The walk to it from the river is very flat, but come prepared for some",

          "The easy to find cathedral is at the base of Fourviere Hill. Less elaborate than the Basilica, (built in a different era), this is a good place to go first. Check for the Camino de Santiago symbol in the pavement in front of the church which marks this as part of an ancient",

          "Like Paris, Lyon has two \"cathedrals\", but here, they are almost adjacent to each other. It's gives you the ability to directly compare Gothic and neo-Gothic styles.",

          "In the heart of Vieux Lyon, the church has a dramatic facade that dominates the eponymous square. It's worth it to just pause in the square, step back, and admire the craftsmanship. The interior is not as colorful as the \"church on the hill\", but it is lovely to admire. I",
          "We were passing by and stopped to explore. Definitely worth 30-60 minutes. Very historic church in the old part of Lyon.",
          "inside contains some fine sculpture, a nice organ, the Cathedrale is a medieval Gothic art and I think ca. 200 years old; nice portails and windows; very nice basilica.",

          "Close to the centre and in the heart of the old town of Lyon the cathedral is worth a visit. Beautiful and not too lavish decorations. There is amazing atstronomical clock as well to see.",
          "Well, most of these churches are interesting in their own way. The USP of this one is perhaps the astronomical clock, which was constructed at a time when ecclesiastical authorities knew for a fact \u2013 supported, apparently, by biblical evidence \u2013 that the sun revolved around the",
          "Built with the stones taken from Roman buildings ( you can see the bigger, lighter Roman stones in the renovated part of the church up front, at the base versus the newer, smaller stones higher up) when cathedral was started in the 11th century. Before, there were even 3",
          "The Cath\u00e9drale de Saint Jean took some 300 years to build, and its overall proportions are very harmonious. The interior is quite sober, and some renovations are required and will in fact start in the course of 2017. If you take a guided tour of the Vieux Lyon, the cathedral",
          "We had a bit of free time one afternoon in Lyon and were wandering the pedestrian shopping street when we came upon the Cathedral de Saint Jean de Baptiste. While we didn't venture inside (we will on our next visit) we did discover the ruins in the adjacent courtyard of earlier",

          "If you get the chance to have a look around then try to visit, really beautiful piece of architect. Stunning ceiling and just a really peaceful place to visit. Henry IV married Marie de Medicis here, I only found that out after visiting here",
          "Primatiale St-Jean is an essential location of Lyon. The site celebrated the wedding of Henry IV and Marie de Medicis, while the Archbishop holds the title of Primate of the Gauls. Very fine stained glass, an extraordinary astrological clock and very fine choir. The Primatiale",
          "Stopped into this cathedral on walk up to the Fourviere and viewed the astronomical clock, photographed the interior and exterior which have amazing architecture. The circle and statue of Saint John are also impressive outside the cathedral.",

          "This may not be as spectacular as the Notre Dame but it is interesting as well. A bit smaller but still a great church.",
          "it's situated in the middle of the old town (Vieux Lyon) so you can't miss it, but take some time to visit it or just enjoy it from outside. Usually busy in the weekends, as the streets are narrow.",
          "This cathedral is in the old town and it is easily reachable from the city centre. It is quite imposing and beautiful from the outside, whereas inside it's kind of \"empty\" - the painted glass windows and the astronomical clock are what I found more interesting",
          "This cathedral is huge that you can actually get lost in it. It is located in the heart of the city and has a great architecture both inside and outside. This is an amazing building to get lost in for history and architecture lovers. I recommend you to find the little hidden",
          "Beautiful building outside, well worth going inside. Beautiful cathedral with terrific stained glass windows. The ancient horological clock is an impressive work of art and tells not only time but also liturgical holidays, phases of the moon, and who knows what other information.",
          "Great location. Beautiful stained glass windows. Lovely chapels in the Cathedral. There is a great courtyard area at the entryway where one may take in the sun and people watch. A cafe where locals visit is just off to the side of the church. On our second visit to that cafe",
          "Can visit if someone has time. Its really nearby to other attractions so can be visited in quick times.",
          "Good place to have a quiet look around amitst the hussle and bussle of the city. The squire in front of the cahedral is also nice.",

          "The Cathedral Saint Jean Batptique is a very nice church close to the centre of Lyon. The has a solid structure with huge columns. Unfortunately the astronomical clock of the cathedral did not work. This was a pity. Anyway, I suggest a visit at the Cathedral , it is worthy! ps:",

          "You will love this place as you do all French cathedrals if that's your thing, like it is for me. It's a very stylised place, old and classical in its inspiration.",
          "The view from the Cathedral is amazing. The Cathedral itself is imposing and looking better on a cloudy day than in the sun: the seriousness of it comes across. It is a solid structure, no futile decorations. One could consider it stern but, in reality, it reaches its scope just",
          "Even if you're not Catholic, check it out. Fun ride in the funicular, incredible view overlooking Lyon and the two rivers. Inside - extraordinary mosaic walls. Even if your vacation threatends to become ABC (another bloody church), make an exception for this one. Easy walk",
          "We were visiting a lot of churches while in France and this was on our itinerary - it was worth the visit because it clearly represented a time and place in the development of churches.",
          "Yes, I know there are wonderful churches everywhere but this one is really a sweet one; and worth look. I love to see the various churches in my travels and this one was worth seeing.",
          "Found this place by luck wanted to go too the Notre Dame but this is a great little gem straight from the Tram station Vieux Lyon it's even a free little museum inside that's worth seeing",
          "There are places that you cannot miss when you visit a city and Cathedral Saint Jean Baptiste is one of them. For the quietness of the place in the middle of Old Lyon or for a view of the autonomic clock or simply to appreciate a piece a religious art, you must definitively pare",
          "I think that cathedrals and clipper ships (1840-1870) are the most beautiful and functional pre-industrial creation of mankind. This was another \"must see\" for me.",
          "This is surely a wonderful church, with an interesting exterior and interior. But travelers may want to know that in addition, St. Jean is known for the various festivals and live shows that are staged in front of the church on the main place-square. Keep your eye open during",

          "We popped in here on our way somewhere else and really enjoyed wandering round and taking in the art on display. The astronomical clock is amazing and should not be missed. Unlike the one it Prague it is at ground level so you can really study the details",
          "A must. Despite of heavy damages during the WWII and the previous periods, nowadays the building demonstrates all its magnificent beauty. In this very place, Henry IV married Marie de Medici in 1600. Find the time to see all the stained-glass windows. Don\u2019t miss the Treasury,",

          "St Jean-Baptiste Church began as a Romanesque building and was continued as a Gothic one. It has charming chapels and beautiful stained glass windows, as well as an astronomical clock (which isn't working). The church is undergoing renovations, so that some statues as well as",
          "If you're lucky enough you may be able to see the stunning front doors that are covered most times to stop the vandals. A much more interesting chaurch steeped in history than the Basillica that towers up above",

          "The Cathedral is stunning both from the outside and within. It has some lovely stained glass. It's a pity that the astrological clock is not working but it's still a beautiful and intricate clock? It must be wonderful to see it in action. The Cathedral is well worth a visit.",
          "Very busy place, beautiful area with many photo ops. One can stroll around the area as well, easily reached by the metro",
          "This is probably one of the most stunning structures that I have been in. The combination of religious history and amazing architecture will take your breath away. I believe that the construction on this church started in the 1100's and wasn't finished until 300 years later. I",
          "Cathedral Saint Jean Baptiste, in Vieux Lyon, is majestic and quieting. It dates to the 1400s. I think it is part of the light show at night, though I did not see that.",

          "A welcome coolness from the Sun is the first thing about this cathedral. The second things is how enormous it is. We slowly walked around looking everywhere as there is a lot to see. If you look up the stained glass windows are magnificent. The colour is truly ethereal. I lit a",
          "We visited Lyon a couple of years ago and missed this lovely building which is situated in the old part of town and shouldn't be confused with the Basilica which is high up on the hilltop. The interior is light and welcoming but do take your time looking around, the stain glass",
          "It's a much needed counter part to the overladen decoration of the basilica. I think one shoud visit both to keep the balance and the insight to the long history of old Lyon.",
          "This cathedral, which you can see from all over Lyon, and from where you can see all Lyon, is a wonderful building, full of interesting details. Look out for the glass paintings and be sure to visit all the smaller niches around in the church. An absolute must if you visit Lyon.",
          "This wonderful Roman Catholic Cathedral was completed in 1476 and is dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. The building is 80 meters long and is in a Gothic architectural style, housing the Lyon Astronomical Clock from the 14th Century. The metro makes this a very easy",

          "The creamy stonework of the cathedral has been well scrubbed inside and out in recent years and currently must look as pristine as when it was begun over 800 years ago. Inside it's rather plain, there are no period carved pews etc so clearly it has suffered a lot of turmoil, my",

          "This is a nice church to visit. At the base of Fourvi\u00e8re hill, next to Vieux Lyon metro station, just before the old town. In fact our itinerary was Fourvi\u00e8re > Saint Jean Baptiste > old town.",

          "I wonder if Lyon has as much pride in this cathedral as it should have. I doubt it. There was work being done when we were there but even the side chapels that weren't being worked on were scruffy. Do they deserve the Raphaels? I'm not sure. The building has the right classical",
          "The church is rather unremarkable, but at least two paintings by Raphael on in the inside as well as sculptures. The church offers free concerts regularly so look for those as well.",

          "Beautiful church, nice square. The church is situated in old lyon. There are cafes and shopping around. The church itself is beautiful and worth a stop-in if you are in the area. I wouldn't trek across town to see it, though. The coolest thing are the ruins of an old church next",
          "This one looks as good as many of the others in the region. The architecture is interesting and you could cover it on one of your city walks. Its easy to find.",
          "My favorite part of this cathedral, named in honor of John the Baptist, is actually the outdoor baptistry! Perfect!",
          "A wonderful and well maintained Cathedral that is full of history intrigue and splendour. Well worth the walk and easy to walk by if you are not careful. Make time and you will not be disappointed.",
          "Entering this stunning Cathedral you'll be amazed at the interior beauty. Looking in every direction results in intricate works of art, stained glass, statues, ornate ceilings .......beautiful",
          "If you've been to other cathedrals in Europe then you won't be surprised. I was far more impressed by the Notre Dame of Fourviere.",
          "We were unable to see the interior of the church but the outside is very impressive. Worth the trip to see especially if you plan time to spend int he area and up the hill.",
          "Once you've visited the Basilica with its ornate beauty, this cathedral can only ever come a trailing second. Fairly plain inside, I'd say its exterior is the main selling point, from an aesthetic point of view.",
          "Nice groin vaulted ceiling. Nice stained glass. Place to light a candle but it doesn't compare with the churches/cathedrals in Rome.",
          "Interesting Gothic church full of symbolism. A must when you are in Lyon. Visit is free and nice restaurants in the neighborhood.",
          "The building is older Gothic in style and beautiful to behold. Inside is cool and serene. The atmosphere invites prayer. This plaque I found interesting.",
          "My wife is a student of stained glass windows and enjoyed studying the windows of the cathedral, for me it was a great historical experience. But the greatest thril was from a large height above the river looking out across the river to see the entire panorama of the city of",
          "Love this Cathedral because it's been renovated, because it is weel located and also because it is full of history and hasa interesting paintings and pieces of art/; Must be visited while i nLyon",
          "Beautiful cathedral! Interior with more light than many European cathedrals. Variety of stain glass windows. Historic clock. Worth a visit",
          "A lovely building with some interesting features but nothing in the atmosphere of the architecture to remember as particularly special. Worth a visit but not awe inspiring, as some similar cathedrals are.",
          "Maybe I'm just cathedral'd out because it seemed like every other beautiful and old cathedral. But what I loved is the 14 century astronomical clock that can be found inside.",
          "This is one of favourite churches in the whole world - if you are a fan of architecture, especially gothic, you should definitely go there. The church is a wonderful piece of art, the atmosphere is filled with history, you can take a stroll around or just sit and look around.",
          "Some great windows from 14th and 15th centuries. Clock from same period is one of earliest mechanical clocks around. Tends to be overshadowed by the more modern basilica up the hill.",
          "This church was not a planned destination, we came across it en route. The stained glass windows are simply superb. As well having a very wide range of old and beautiful stained glass from there 13th century it has some exciting, well designed and impressive contemporary stained",
          "The Cathedral itself is undergoing renovation, so it's perhaps unfair to review it now, but from the looks of things it's another and not terribly interesting Gothic chathedral. Inside, however, is an astonishing clock, timed to show all the church observance days over a very",
          "Beautiful place. Took me 15min to see all of it and take pictures. I went from Perrache Railway station to the cathedral by foot and it only took me 20min counting the pause in Bellecours Place.A must see if you visit Lyon",
          "A large but relatively plain interior with the astronomic clock, L'Horloge astronomique, a differentiating feature. Figurines start moving at noon, 2pm, 3pm and 4pm.",
          "Loved visiting this Cathedral. So much history. Loved the stained glass windows. Easy to walk to from most areas or take pu lib transportation.",
          "When I visited it there was also a rehearsal for a children choir inside. It sounded angelic, I totally loved it. I assume that they play on Sunday sometimes.",
          "I went with my husband and my 8-year-old daughter to visit this Cathedral. It was just the perfect size to go with a child as it was not overwhelming. My daughter had a great time recognizing the architectural elements from her book \"Cathedral\" and we all enjoyed seeing the",
          "It was interesting to see for sure but in my later journeys in other parts of France I saw more spectacular ones. Great to visit though because it is free, only takes about 15-20min, and it does have a really amazing clock inside.",
          "It's not a magnificent cathedral. It's an average old church which currently is being renovated, but it look drab. Cathedrals in France, like the Notre Dame of Paris, or Chartres are so much more imposing.",
          "Is like any other churches, nothing special but the area outside the church is a place for people gathering, street artist and the alley nearby is crowded... worth to visit (this area).",
          "A true gem and much larger than it appears! A great place to visit before heading up the hill on the Funiculaire... well worth a stop!",
          "We visited the Cathedral on Christmas Eve, intent on attending Midnight Mass...which we discovered starts at 11:00 in Lyon. The cathedral's Astronomical clock is phenomenal. Parking lot nearby, albeit laden with street parking around the cathedral (all full when we visited).",
          "On a truly ancient site, where Christian activity can be dated from the 2nd century CE. Less ornate than the Notre Dame Basilica, but well worth your visit. Note the astronomical clock that I've read dates religious celebrations up to 2019 (after which, one presumes,",
          "This cathedral was certainly in the heart of the old town, but it was not a statement style major cathedral in the city. It was rather an old plain cathedral with simple understated interior and exterior. I didn't bother to take any photo.",
          "This cathedral is nothing really spectacular. You'll find its interior very plain and dull especially if you have visited La Fourvi\u00e8re first. However, its exterior looks quite good and its location is on a very nice old square which makes for beautiful pictures.",
          "The cathedral was undergoing massive renovation so it was impossible to get a feel for the place. Will have to return when work is done",
          "I like the Basilica better as it is very unique. The Cathedral still holds plenty of history and charm and it easy to visit.",
          "The cathedral is now being cleaned and repaired so muck cannot be seen, but it is clear that it will soon be a quite elegant again. Hope to return ...",
          "You can travel to this Cathedral with a special mountain tram/train and walk down on foot through the narrow streets of the old city of Lyon. Combine it with a visit to the Roman remains just around the corner. Good place to visit.",
          "This master piece charmed me in so many ways! The beauty from its outside isn't comparable with the tremendous impressive detailed walls and ceiling. It is definetely in my list of the most beautiful cathedrals in Europe!",
          "Like most other cathedrals I\u2019ve seen, this big, good looking structure is so large in relation to the buildings around it that it dominates its neighborhood. I felt dwarfed when I stood in the square to admire it. Our visit to this part of Vieux Lyon being all too hurried, I\u2019ll",
          "This beautiful Cathedral or to be absolutely correct beautiful Basilica is currently undergoing repair work internally but this does not spoil the experience. The sculptures, stained glass windows and artwork are really nice. Externally the white marble look exceptional in the",
          "One of the worth a visit when you are in Lyon, the glass windows are beautiful as it was saved during the 2nd world war. Located not far from subway stop. Challenging to find car park.",
          "There are scaffolding works at the moment inside the cathedral. I wasn't impressed. I would skip it. If you have an extra time to kill, go there. Otherwise, waste of time.",
          "Incredible artwork and sculptures inside the church. The facade is beautiful. The church is very large, really beautiful.",
          "Its by far the most ornate church I've ever been inside. Outside is it just above average but inside its breathtaking. The mosaics covering all the walls, the unique and detailed stone work throughout the interior is second to none. It craps on the notre dam cathedral in paris",
          "I just love this cathedral! The architecture and stained glass are beautiful. If you like ornate features, you are bound to prefer the basilica of Fourviere. The two cathedrals are quite incomparable. I prefer St Jean for it's simplicity and feel of spiritual peacefulness.",
          "If you love architecture then you must walk through this cathedral. It's very accessible and well worth your time.",
          "The Cathedral is well worth a visit on a walking tour of old Lyon. The windows are spectacular. The Cathedral was being repaired when we visited.",
          "I was really interested in knowing it since it really massive and impressive speacilly from the sides. But , in the inside it's kind of disappointing.",
          "Inspiring awe to anyone, religious or not, the Cathedral of Saint Jean stands outside Vieux Lyon metro station and it is the first part in your journey in Vieux Lyon and the Hill of Fouvriere/Notre Dame de Fouvriere. I recommend coming here around noon and after finishing your",
          "The cathedral is very central near the market in old Lyon. The building is typical of cathedrals that have been built and developed over 100s of years. The clock is a major point of interest and you should wait for it to strike.",
          "Lyon Cathedral is stunning, no doubt about it. Inside, however, it's a bit bare and not quite the draw I was expecting, except for the Cathedral Treasures museum. This is a must-see for any visitor to the city, from an aesthetic as well as historical point of view.",
          "Go there at night and see the city lights from above. The view is Beautiful and the cathedral too. You can walk from the city, but know there is a lot of stairs ;)",
          "This was part of my Traboules walking tour and it wasn't on my list of things to see. But, it's a beautiful cathedral, lots of history to absorb and the original ruins impacting. Surprisingly educational.",
          "I was super excited about this place, I did not really expect this kind of architect structure. I would really recommend this to everyone to visit",
          "It is very impressive from the outside but the inside was rather plain (comparatively speaking) and a good part of it was blocked off for renovations. I think we would have appreciated it more if we could have seen more of it.",
          "The cathedral is particularly impressive inside, although was undergoing renovation so a portion was closed off. The glass and ceilings viewed from the pews were fantastic. The collection of artifacts was incredibly interesting, and not something I had seen before,",
          "We enjoyed our visit to St. Jean although it was a little bit of a let down after we had just seen the Basilique on the hill behind it! Yes, there are two cathedrals only steps apart (187 steps up the hill actually). The exterior of St. Jean is quite stunning as was the ceilings",
          "This is a beautiful climb and worth taking the stairs up but take the tram down. Many stops for photos and places to enjoy the view. At the top by the church there are places to use the restroom and eat. Church is beautiful with a unique history. My husband and I are not a fan",
          "This is a beautiful building in the shadow of Fourviere. Set in the heart of Middle-age Lyon it is dripping in history and both the Cathedral and the surrounding area are a joy to walk through and discover",
          "A stunning site. Must see while you are in the old section of town. The clock is no longer working due to a tourist throwing a beer can at it. Still stop in and check it out.",
          "It is a very nice place, where you can appreciate many clothes and staff from the past. Actually it is being renew, but you can still enjoy the monument.",
          "This is really Lyon Cathedral which has a beautiful Gothic exterior but is very interesting inside. It has been rather overlooked following the construction of the Notre Dame de Fourviere cathedral. Make sure you visit the astronomical clock which indicates the position of the",

          "Nice Large Cathedral with beautiful stained glass windows and murals painted on the wall. Photo taking was allowed inside, there was a lot to see. Small gift shop inside.",
          "Went with my French cousins before dinner. Superb and in a remarkable state of preservation. The statuary is worth the trip.",
          "This is a nice cathedral and square right at the start of Vieux Lyon. Inside they are working in the back of the church, so a big sheet (for lack of a better word) cuts off half the church. You cannot see most of the church. If you're short on time, right now the Basilica is",
          "This is not a large cathedral but tranquil and welcoming, although there was building work going on. There were few staff in attendance but I gathered that during the week there was only a mass at nine (at least that was what we were told) so we had to be content with lighting a",
          "We visited this cathedral in the morning with a lof of people, it was under renovation and less interesting compared to some Cathedrals that we had visited before in Paris. The location was so good as it's located in the heart of this charming city",
          "This is a wonderful church but at this time most of it is closed off to visitors as it is under refurbishment. I'm sure it'll be spectacular when it's done.",
          "Okay, God may strike me down for this, but Europe is full of better cathedrals than this one. Cologne, Paris, Strasbourg, Chartres, just to name a few. This isn't a BAD cathedral, and it IS being worked on. But it's not worth a trip to Lyon just to see. Come to Lyon for the",
          "Be warned that as of July 2015 the cathedral is undergoing interior renovation so only part of it is accessible. However it is an impressive monuments which has been totally cleaned outside and looks magnificent. Admire all the paintings inside.",
          "Not as big as the one in Paris, but perhaps even more ornate, with no crowds. Absolutely beautiful and worth a look.",

          "An absolutely breathtaking church. The art and decor is gorgeous. A peaceful space to pray and feel the presence of a higher being. I lit candles, prayed and made a donation , all so nourishing \u2026\u2026 We were fortunate to sit in on a service , although in another language, we felt",
          "Awe inspiring. Very old cathedral, I believe they said it's either the oldest church in Europe or in France.",
          "The Cathedral is as beautiful as the city of Lyon. Lovely square in front of the Cathedral is full of tourists of course, but it is easy to find a good picture opportunity. The entrance is free, including the treasury which has interesting richly adorned religious objects on",
          "Unfortunately when i visited, they were doing construction on half the cathedral. But they still had a lot of it open to the public. Beside the cathedral they also have the ruins of a second church. Its interesting to see and may be worth checking out while you're there.",
          "Not just the cathedral but the area surrounding is really amazing. There are ruins of two early structures just to the right of the cathedral that are also very interesting. Several days as we were walking past there were kids playing guitars and singing, one afternoon there was",
          "We were here on a Viking River Cruise, and even though it was a very chilly morning, we took the bus tour here from the ship. As you can see from some of the other reviews on this subject, some people liked the stained glass and interior, and some did not. I thought it was",

          "This is a lovely cathedral, particularly beautiful when lit up at night and viewed from above. My recommendation woudl be to visit here before taking the stairs of doom up to the golden clad Basillica on top of the hill as it may seem somewhat spartan by comparison. Sit outside",

          "The basilica on the hill may be more visible from all over town, but it is nothing architecturally compared to St Jean. The building next to it has a fascinating facade with, I think, no two parallel lines on it. The cathedral is lovely outside and in. And don't miss the old",
          "As with other churhcs in Europe- as good as average which are indeed nice nothing spectacular but if you're in town for a few days especially in inlcement weather- go see it",

          "So going to this chapel I could not put my camera down. I probably took well over 400 pictures of the building inside and out. Stunning and highly spiritual place. You can light a candle and say a prayer, have confession, or just simply tour the hard carved detailed artwork",

          "Very much the heart of Lyon. beautiful cathedral sitting in a square that's a popular meeting place. Would greatly recommend a visit and there's often music in the cathedral and bands playing in the square which makes the visit even better",
          "Some great history in this area, with ruins of original churches protected outside. The Cathedral is beautiful and the art inside is interesting. The plaza area outside the cathedral has some nice little cafes to stop for an espresso and soak in the atmosphere of this old part",
          "Tucked away behind a spacious courtyard and fountain is the Gothic St. Jean Cathedral, festooned with dozens of gargoyles, prophets and saints on the outside. The interior is a little more stark but redeemed by a fantastic , towering astronomical clock that only strikes at",

          "This church is quite nice, with a good sense of history, but be warned, we could only see the back of the church as there is a huge screen blocking off the Chancel and Choir. This work will not be done until 2017 I think, so check. Also the famous astrological clock had been",
          "Restoration is being done inside of the church, so we couldn't see the astronomical clock that's supposed to be very accurate. There are foundation ruins in the back of the church that originate from over 1000 years ago. A note worthy place to see if you're in the area. Read up",
          "Very large, and not any where near as much detail as the Basilica. Restoration taking place on the interior, so you can't see the alter or the astronomical clock. It's free, and OK for a quick visit.",

          "A lovely old local lady gave us a tour around this church and it was impressively large. I enjoyed the experience even though I am in no way religious myself. If you are in the area it is worth popping into as it does not cost anything.",
          "Beautiful architecture. The Cathedral exterior has been cleaned recently. If you come in the late afternoon, the sun light on it is beautiful. At the moment, the inside is being restored so you won't be able to see the astronomical clock.",
          "The French Revolution really did its worst in Lyon. Most of the decoration, including windows and sculpture, was destroyed, and whereas in some Lyon churches the 19th century revival restored much of the atmosphere, this hasn't happened so much here. The building is still worth",
          "The Cathedral is being repaired and renovated on a massive scale, and it is unlikely that it will be fully open to visitors in the near future. You can enter the building but almost all of the interior is blanked off with partitions.",

          "We visited when it was raining and at the end of school holidays and the start of Universite de Lyon.So we had the place to ourselves and it was very peaceful and restful.Such history and artitecture.Absolutely stunning and well worth a visit.Do not forget to check the torist",

          "beautiful interior with ceramics, and also and excellent view of the city from this hilltop location.",
          "Located in the old town, the frontage is great with a big clock and lots of gargoyles. Some of these are not your usual gargoyle dragon creatures but include sheep and some kind of bird of prey. The interior is quite small and plain, with some interesting stained glass but not",
          "This cathedral is located in the city center. It is noted for its exterior. Inside it is not one of the greater cathedrals of the EU. However in the summer it is worth a visit if only for the cooler temps and respite of the direct sun. You will most likely be walking",
          "Yeah...it's another cathedral but you need to check it out all the same. A tribute to Mary, you will see the various interpretations of her throughout the world.",

          "I visited it as part of the free guided tour to the old city, which I booked in the tourist information hall. A usual gothic church that internal scaffolding and work-in-progress have ruined any kind of expected tranquility and awe . The square in front and the fa\u00e7ade is much",
          "this is in the heart of 'old lyon' a must see to experience the evolution of the city which has become a gem",

          "Together with the Basilique de Notre Dame de Fourviere, this Cathedral is one of the important places of worship in Lyon. Located in the heart of Vieux Lyon and a short walk from the river Sa\u00f4ne river, it has a large plaza in front and a metro stop nearby. Noteworthy are the",
          "This cathedral is spectacular! There is so much to see that it's almost too much to take in. It's both beautiful and complex at the same time. Personally I preferred the chapel underneath.",

          "This church was stunning, on top of a mountain after a VERY long climb, it was well worth it. Amazing views for MILES and an amazing building.... oh, and there's a lift.... didn't spot that on the way up!!",
          "Even though this Cathedral is centuries older than Fourviere, it literally and figuratively stands in it's shadow. Saint Jean Baptiste is impressive with it's Gothic details and looming profile along the river, but the most enjoyable aspect of visiting the church was the lively",
          "Set in the vieux Lyon . This is a lovely Cathedral to visit while roaming around the streets of the Old Lyon.",
          "A very impressive site both day and nighttime when it's all illuminated. The square in front is clean and well kept too and there are two very good bars on the corner as you head onto the Rue St Jean",
          "I think some of the reviews are for the wrong cathedral. This place is not on a hill and does not have a funicular. Its on a square in level old town on the south end. Its ok if you are there, but I wouldnt plan a special trip to it.",
          "Cathedral St. Jean is a gorgeous, massive cathedral that sits on a hill overlooking Lyon. Its presence in the city landscape is unmistakable. You do NOT need a car to get to it, in fact I recommend against it as parking around the cathedral is an issue. You can take a bus (C3)",
          "Vieux Lyon all round is a gorgeous area of Lyon to visit, with the winding streets with lovely shops, restaurants and cafes. The Cathedral is placed in a very pretty square, and is a beautiful building.",
          "Walk up the many steps or take the winding road up the mountain from Vieux Lyon. The view of the city is wonderful. Take the time to go below ground to the cathedral below. In November 2013, extensive work to the high front facia is underway, so the photogenic quality of the",

          "The newly restored exterior is exquisite and worth a detailed look while you sip a coffee nearby. Currently the sanctuary is covered off for restoration and not accessible. On first viewing the body of the church which is currently accessible is dark and unattractive with much",
          "We took the train up to the top of the old town to the Cathedral and walked back down through the winding streets. Apparently renovation recently complete, the Cathedral is quite stunning. We're not religious, but you can't help being drawn into the atmosphere. There are guides",
          "The outside is ornate but the inside is quiet simple and that is what makes this place special. their was a funeral in progress when we visited, so we did not get to look at the entire building, but there was a great calmness about the church. Also of interest was the history on",
          "Situated at the edge of the old townw which has many little nick knack shops selling lots of interesting things the cathedral has a very solemn atmosphere and is a nice place to stop for a few moment to count your blessings.",
          "Before you enter the monument, there is a nice archaeological site, showing you the previous cathedral and the history of religion in Lyon. very interesting. The outside of the building is a good example of Roman and Gothic style. Inside everything is well explained and there is",
          "Situated in the Old City, it is easily accessible and very lovely and interesting. I lit a candle for my dear dad here so it will remain special to me.",
          "We are not really into churches and cathedrals but took the trip up to the basilica and we were so glad we did. The view is great and we really enjoyed wandering around. The church is worth seeing.",

          "Place is really nice to see. A lot of people and visitors who come to pray and see the cathedral. Architectural style is worth seeing",
          "St. Jean Baptiste looks beautiful from the outside (very similar to ND in Paris), but inside wasn't as spectacular. What impressed us the most was the Ancient ruins to the left of the church that were from thousands of years ago. The location of the cathedral was right in the",

          "The church itself was undergoing construction, but there is a small treasury room off to the side that is very easy to miss. They have magnificent pieces - chalices ,miters, tapestries, incredible vestments. That room was worth the visit, and it didn't cost a thing.",

          "The center of Vieux Lyon, the Cathedral is still an active, functioning church. Although under repair when we visited, it is still well worth a visit. It anchors the square in Old Lyon and is a frequent meeting place, welcoming visitors to sit and enjoy the unique atmosphere",

          "Lovely sunny day when we visited and the sun shone right thru the cathedral and out thru the stained glass windows on the north side - magical! Inside it is also undergoing repair, so you cannot get further than the crossing. However, it does have an amazing astrological clock",
          "This was a great walk and a beautiful church. My wife and I walked up to this church, which was a bit of a hike but well worth it when you get to the top. This is a must see in Lyon.",
          "This is not one of the \"great\" French Gothic cathedrals, but I enjoyed my visit very much. I stopped there while doing the \"Hop-on Hop-off Bus Tour.\" The building as small but has the height French cathedrals are known for and the sunlight streaming though the upper windows",

          "If you can, visit the Cathedral with a tour guide who can tell you about all the gargoyles and carvings, the small set of Roman ruins nearby, and the tabboules (secret passageways) of Old Town right next to the Cathedral. Definitely worth it as a historical place to visit, and",

Previously presented at the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon and the Antiquarium, the municipal Gallo-Roman collection was transferred to a new building designed by Bernard Zehrfuss and opened in 1975 near the city's Roman theatre and odeon, on a hill known as Fourvi\u00e8re, located in the heart of the Roman city. Internally, it is formed of a concrete spiral ramp descending and branching out into the display rooms. It is managed and operated by the Metropolis of Lyon jointly with the archaeological museum of Saint-Romain-en-Gal. As well as displaying its own permanent collections of Roman, Celtic and pre-Roman material (inscriptions, statues, jewellery, everyday objects), a plan-relief of the ancient town and scale models of its major monuments such as the theatre and the Odeon, it also regularly hosts temporary exhibitions.\n\n\n== Circus Mosaic ==\n\nDiscovered in the Ainay district in 1806, this mosaic shows a circus during a chariot race, making it one of the few ancient representations of such a race (Lyon itself had a circus, the place of which has not been discovered).\n\n\n== Other Objects ==\nthe Gallic Coligny calendar\nfragments of the decoration of the Altar of Rome and Augustus, from the federal sanctuary of the three Gauls\nthe Lyon Tablet, a speech by Claudius\nlarge mosaics such as La mosa\u00efque de Bacchus and the Mosa\u00efque aux Svastikas (Swastikas Mosaic).\nthe Taurobolic Altar, dedicated in 160 to restore the health of Antoninus Pius\nmany large Dionysiac sarcophagi, including the Sarcophagus of the Triumph of Bacchus\nthe Lyon-Vaise Hoard of dishes, jewellery and silver statuettes buried during a 3rd-century Germanic invasion\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English)",

          "This place is very close to the train stop, however this place is not that impressive as I expected. To enjoy it, just enough to go from the upper section of the hill and enjoy 15 mins there to take some pictures.",
          "Museum gives an excellent overview of the history of Lyon and the amphitheater. The building itself is unique because it has been tucked into the hillside so visually it does not interfere with the amphitheater.",
          "Over several floors there's a large collection of Roman antiquities including large Mosaics. Good to visit this museum on the way down form the Basilique Notre Dame de Fourviere and take in the amphitheatre.",
          "Would highly recommend. Offers good value for the 4euro entry fee (free with the Lyon City Card). The building itself is discreetly built in to the side of the hill, with two large picture windows at lower levels, offering great views of the amphitheatre. The exhibition is",
          "While I had a bad experience in the Theatres Romains de Fourviere, we really enjoyed the Gall-Roman Museum. Because they were in between special exhibitions, we got in for half-price. I'm continually amazed by tile mosaics from thousands of years ago--who has that patience! This",
          "I would recommend a trip to this museum, funky design almost into the cliff with a wealth of interesting exhibits. You can also scroll through the actual ruins too and the hop on hop off bus stops there.",
          "I really enjoyed this archaeological site and museum - it was rich with the history of Lyon during Roman times. The Theater site is remarkable - so large and well preserved. Beautiful views from the hilltop as well. The museum has lovely examples of public tablets, mosaic",
          "Medium sized collection with interesting pieces. The colourful mosaics are the most eye-catching. Don't miss the remains of the old chariot used in religious processions, the craftsmanship on the wheels is amazing. The most important items have explanatory texts in French and",
          "To see the museum is to see history. The facility itself is dramatic: a spiral down the inside of a hill. The collection of roman and pre-roman artifacts is unparralled. The bronze inscriptions making the citizens of Lyon citizens of Rome is amazing. So too are the mosaics and",
          "a great example of an old roman theatre, plenty to see and well preserved. The remains are free entry, Im not sure about the museum as we ran out of time and had to leave to catch our flight. a stones throw from the basilica so plenty to see",
          "Excellent source for viewing early gallon-roman objects as well as a good selection of prehistoric items.",
          "Nice, modern museum with many ancient Roman artifacts and some English descriptions. Amazingly well-preserved Roman theaters. We were there on the first Sunday of the month, so entry was free, however, the audioguides are not available on free Sundays. The audioguide might have",
          "A must visit to when you are in LYON. We are so glad that the museum had English translation. The museum structure was well planned. It sort of assimilated it self to the ancient Gallo-Roman theater.",
          "Cleverly built into the hillside with views over the amphitheatre, this superior museum displays many fascinating artifacts from the city's long past. Remarkable mosaics, statues, as well as many more domestic items that tell an insightful story.",
          "In the first instance, you can't readily see it. The museum was built into a hillside and surrounded by greenery which belies what is to be experienced once inside. Fully accessible ramps to all levels, I can't call them floors, you make your way through the exhibits till you",
          "A totally brilliant museum Well presented with an excellent audio guide Magnificent artefacts Unmissable in my opinion",
          "We walked down from the Basilica on the top of the hill to discover what was the location of the previous occupants of Lyon. The amphitheatre and ruins are amazing but the museum is fascinating with showing the vast collection of artifacts unearthed while excavating various",
          "If you visit the Roman ruins of Lyon, you must visit the museum. It will answer the questions you ask when you view this amazing work of architecture and definitely fuel your interest in ancient history",
          "Amazing artifacts and the adjacent Roman ruins \u2013 theatre, palace and odeon \u2013 were quite breathtaking. The museum is large and cleverly designed to blend in to the landscape. One starts at the top and descends down the museum to view the artifacts. Unfortunately access from the",
          "We called in to this on our way to Fourviere. The amphitheatre is impressive and the acoustics are amazing. We really enjoyed this museum as it covered the early history of Roman Lyon.",
          "We visited the two amphitheatres and were most impressed not only with the architecture but the ongoing maintainence work. Obviously very popular as they were either setting up or taking down extensive concert equipment. The museum is for a future visit!",
          "The ampitheater itself is impressive enough, with it's main section, as well as a second, smaller theater, both of which are accessible for free. Then you add on an amazing museum built into the hillside which itself a work of art inside, and a collection of pre-Roman and Roman",
          "The presentation of the exhibits in the museum was excellent, using a lot of audio-visual tools to enhance the experience. The mosaics are just amazing! We also really enjoyed the large section on the games played by both children and adults back in the days of Roman Gaul.",
          "This is a must for any student of Roman history. They even have a pump, one of the few that have been found. Lyon was basically the administrative center for all of Gaul. It is adjacent to the Roman theater.",
          "Lyon was one of the major cities in Roman Gaul and as a result has an incredibly deep and rich history. This museum is filled with incredible articfacts and exhibits and is built into the side of the hill in which the Roman amphitheatre and Odean were sited. This museum is great",
          "What a gem of a find! If you make the trek up to the basilica then this is only a short walk away and right next to the ancient theatre of Fourvi\u00e8re. So many exhibits and a really interesting talk on the audio about life there in the past. Sensational mosaics that blew me away.",
          "This museum is outstanding. We were astonished by how good it was. It\u2019s five or so floors full of Roman treasures most of which are very well arranged and presented. The mosaics are easily the best we\u2019ve ever seen anywhere. Some of them are huge and look like they were laid",
          "The city of Lyon was once a great Roman town and this museum houses a considerable amount of beautiful roman art The layout is of particular help to those of us less mobile Exquisite mosaics and statues are well worth the visit",
          "It's a bit of a trek but if you're visiting the Basilica anyway you can't miss this. Loads of greats exhibits and mosaics and great views of the amphitheatre.",
          "I spent about an hour and a half here. Very good audiovisual guide. What surprised me was how accessible the exhibits were. They have an excellent variety of displays and I particularly enjoyed the section regarding funeral rites. Worth visiting.",
          "The electricity was out so we could only walk around the ruins and the stands. A band was setting up. Definitely seems like a fantastic place to be at for a concert.",
          "I am fascinated by Roman history, and this museum was even better than I'd expected. There are spectacular mosaic floors in perfect condition, sculpture, vases, beautiful roman glassware, and of course, the theater.",
          "This museum is one of the worst museums I have ever seen : we took our 65 twelve-year-old students on a weekday. Nobody had booked our group, the cashier assistants did not remember our phone conversation and out of the 20 persons working there none could tell us where to go",
          "Found this by accident and so glad we did. The history and its impact in this beautiful city in France was world class. The architecture of the purpose built museum, story of how it came to be, awesome audio tour in many languages and then the incredible roman amphitheatre were",
          "If you have an interest in Roman history, this museum is a must. I found the exhibits to be quite interesting and I especially enjoyed the amazing mosaic floors which have been recovered from the various ruins around Lyon.",
          "We walked up from the old city, which was a hike and a half. Anyway, this is a rather impressive amphitheater from the Roman era and is worth the visit. We didn\u2019t manage the inside museum, but the open air remains are one of the biggest sites I have come across.",
          "Architecturally this purpose-built modern structure really sets the stage for showcasing a sensational collection of Roman artefacts from around Lyon some 2000 years ago. It is adjacent to the 2 amphitheatres, which you can walk in and around, or if you prefer to sit and",
          "As long as you aren't going through this museum with a school group, you are good to go. It's worth seeing before you go and wander outside amongst the ruins.",
          "Absolutely amazing museum. The exhibits are wonderful and the museum architecture is amazing. Definitely a must see. Oh ya, and actual Roman theatres are awesome and free. Check times for openings before you climb up from the town. The view is great.",
          "Excellent place, on a nice location. Has a lot to offer, the staff is nice. Can visit on free museum nights too",
          "I came across this museum as I walked up to the Roman ruins. It is an unusual design as it is built into the side of a hill near the ruins, and has two large viewing windows that overlook the ruins. Some of the objects inside were truly astonishing. However I found that the",
          "This museum situated in a natural amphitheater on the mount in Fourvi\u00e8re is a must see on your trip to Lyon. Nestled beside the Roman theatre and Odeon ruins which are magnificent in themselves, this museum brings to life the ancient Gallo-Roman history of the area. Audio guides",
          "Working in Lyon for a couple of weeks and my wife and 3 year old are also here, so looking for things to do this place cropped up as top of many lists. Its a pleasant walk through old town and up the hill. The Museum itself is surprisingly large inside and full of interesting",
          "Amazing history of Lyon, great to be able to walk in the amphitheatre. Loved the audio tour, all the artifacts and the simple layout. Learned a lot about Roman Lugdunum! It was a really nice museum with interesting architecture too.",
          "The architecture of the museum alone, built so it is effectively invisible from outside, is worth a visit. There is a lot of content in the museum and it's well presented. The English audio-guide (included) helps explain your way around if you need it - although quite a few",
          "An essential stop on your visit to Lyon. Spectacular views of the city. Incredible chance to step back in time in a Roman amphitheatre of incredible quality.",
          "The museum is well laid out. Be sure to bring earbuds to use with the hand held sets. Well worth the visit and was reasonably priced.",
          "This could have been a very boring visit but it wasn't. There is a wealth of exhibits here, very well present in a quite amazing building built into the side of the hill by the roman ruins. Very good.",
          "Fascinating deep history of Lyon, with an excellent display showing changes over time from the earliest, pre-historic times. Great collection of mosaics. And fantastic view of the Roman theaters.",
          "Great place to visit if you are interested in Roman history and artifacts. Although the building is very modern, the items inside are from ancient Rome. The museum covers three floors. However, you do not need to take an elevator or stairs to the next level. Simply walk",
          "We were quite surprised by this museum and spent a couple hours enjoying the collection. Definitely worth visiting when in Lyon. The view of the ruins from the windows of the museum make it much easier to understand what it must have been like when it was in use.",
          "It\u2019s a bit of a hike up the hill, perched next to the Roman theater, but well worth it for lovers of Roman artifacts. Fabulous mosaics presented so you can stand next to them or above and one of the best collections of epigraphy I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s a surprisingly large and complete",
          "Situated alongside the Roman Amphitheatres in Fourviere this museum must rank as one of the most imaginative of museum designs. Set into the hillside and now covered in vegetation it is barely visible. Starting at the top floor one moves from open gallery to open gallery by way",
          "This is a very good museum showcasing the archeological findings from excavations in and around Lyon; mosaics, sculpture, and furnishings. Most of the items are from the Roman period. The museum is next to the excavated amphitheater and odeon. Would definitely go back.",
          "This museum, adjacent to the most significant Roman ruins in Lyon, is well worth your time. It focuses very much on everyday life in the region, has some exemplary displays, and is a great antidote to the vaster and more grandiose collections you'll find in Rome, New York, etc.",
          "Maybe we've just seen too many archaelogical museums, but this one does little more than present the artifacts by way of little written descriptions. If you like reading a lot of little descriptions, you'll like this museum. Two weeks on, all I'll likely remember is the",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the exhibits and thematic layout of major centre in Roman times. Visit amphitheatre on site. 5 minutes to add basilica. Very short funicular ride from Vieux Lyon. Plan for whole lot 5 hours.",
          "This museum is exceptionally well designed. It takes up a very small footprint on the side of the hill overlooking the Roman theater ruins. It develops it exhibition space by descending five levels from the entrance with two viewing areas cut through to see the ruins. Exhibits",
          "Ever read Asterix the Gaulois? The comix? Ever wondered who lived in France before Julius Caesar lead his troops over the Alps? Ever had questions about their art, their beliefs? Well... come to Lyon, France, and visit the Museum! The building itself is hidden in the hillside",
          "After visiting the two preserved Roman theaters this museum was a terrific way to grasp the significance of the entire setting. The artifacts are amazing and were presented in a very clear and understandable manner.",
          "This is a must in Lyon. The museum itself is an architectural gem with windows overlooking the Roman ruins. Lyon was the capital of Roman Gaul. The Emperor Claudius was born in Lyon. The Roman artifacts found in Lyon are extensive, stunning, and beautifully displayed.",
          "A highlight of a recent visit to Lyon, I really enjoyed this museum, it is very well integrated with the remains of the Roman theatre and odeon which are just outside. Didn't know before I visited this museum that the Emperor Claudius was actually born in Lyon. It's a short walk",
          "We arrived a bit early and went into the Roman Amphitheatre very helpfully they have an entrance to the Museum at that level. The Museum itself is almost invisible form the Roman Amphitheatre as it id built underground into the hill. The layout is extremely well done with ramps",
          "Before we left the country, I asked the question how to get to this museum. What roundabout answers were posted! But thanks to the tourist information center at Place Bellecour, it was so easygoing! Here is what you do: get to the Vieux Lyon /Cathedrale Saint-Jean metro stop.",
          "This is a good museum for someone who hasn\u2019t seen a lot of Roman history. It is well designed and covers the history and life and culture of Lyon plus the amphitheater next door is free. Only problem was the English audio guide was hard to find the exhibit numbers to listen",
          "Enjoyed this museum for the collection and for the labels and headsets in English. The museum building is very attractive and the exhibits are laid out in an easy to follow uncrowded pattern. It was so interesting to read the translations of the epitaphs of so many everyday",
          "I visited with my husband and 14 year old son. My husband has studied Latin, loves visiting Rome, and is knowledgeable and interested in Roman history. He found it tedious. My son and I found it uninteresting. While I wouldn\u2019t be very interested in Roman history, a good museum",
          "It's interesting how they built the museum into the hill so it's not visible from above! It tells the Roman history in Lyon, with the best part being a 5-10 minute presentation that shows the city from above and the effect of the lighting brings the changes over the centuries",
          "Loved this museum! My sister and I had both studied Latin for many years, and I had taught Ancient Civilisations, so this museum (and its amphitheatre) was a gold mine for us. The mosaic floors, almost complete, were jaw-dropping, and we recognised many of the displays from",
          "This a great large Roman collection. It\u2019s well laid out. I recommend getting the free audio guide. The fresco collections are nice.",
          "Much more interesting than I expected. The audio guide was helpful and the museum is modern and well later out. Well worth a visit",
          "Hadn\u2019t planned but recognised it from photos when visiting the amphitheater. Was only \u20ac4 entry and is awash with artefacts, all found locally. Had wanted to see a Roman mosaic and this place has several, even one you\u2019re allowed to walk on. The museum\u2019s architecture/design is",
          "With beautiful arhicture, history, cuisine, shopping streets and 2 rivers, Lyon has so much to offer. Visited this place while coming back from Noter-dam and its full of history, culture and you can also take good shots of Lyon City from here.",
          "I hadn't planned on attending this museum when I went up the hill, but when I saw the window portals sticking out of the hillside I had to go in. A beautifully designed building, the highlight of the collection are some very large and impressive pictoral tile floor mosaics that",
          "A very rich, very well presented collection in a very interesting, architecturally speaking, building. Don' t miss it, even if you are tired of museum visiting.",
          "There is one heckuva lot to see in this museum. The exhibits offer up an excellent portrayal of life in Roman times in the Lyon area. What's really magic is the quantity of items that have unearthed only recently. Some large and beautiful mosaics. The construction of",
          "The museum is located next to the Roman amphitheater on the Fourviere Hill. It tells the story of Gallo-Roman Lyon through wonderfully displayed artefacts in a piece of modern architecture that suits its purpose admirably but is itself a work of art. The curation is excellent,",
          "We've seen Roman museums before; we've seen Roman amphitheaters before. Never before have we seen such a strange concrete spiral of a museum work so well to tell the tale of ancient Gallo-Roman history. You enter the museum at ground level, where temporary exhibits dominate the",
          "It\u2019s not often that you have the chance to see a well integrated museum in the existing landscape. It reveals the story of Roman Lyon quite well!",
          "We expected a lot to see a lot of Roman stone when we visited the museum, and weren\u2019t sure this would hold our interest for long. The multimedia presentation, with lighting on a topo model was a highpoint, however, in our understanding of the history of the area. The mosaics",
          "Mus\u00e9e gallo-romain de Lyon-Fourvi\u00e8re is a must see if you visit Lyon, France. Roman Lugdunum was the most important city in the western part of the Roman Empire, so it has a fascinating story to tell. As time passed and history took the city through many changes, Lugdunum gave",
          "This is a wonderful piece of architecture - designed by Bernard Zehrfuss, better known for the Renault factory and other public works. It's built into a steep hill - the one the Romans left out when they built their theatre . but it looks out over the splendid site. It is worth",
          "Unmissable piece of Roman history in Gaul and Lyon's part in it. The jewellery and mosacis are fantastic.",
          "There are plenty of other reviews about the museum itself so nothing I can say would add much, except for a couple of points. The first is the audioguide. To get one of these you need to provide a National ID card or a driving license. As a Brit I do not have the former, as I",
          "One can wander about and explore the two roman theaters for free, but the musuem is very well organized and informative. Can easily spend a couple of hours at the site and helps to make sense of Roman Gaul.",
          "There is nothing bad about this museum. 1. The roman theater is right outside which is very fun to stand in the middle of and hear the stunningly engineered acoustics. 2. There is a bathroom on every floor and and an elevator. 3. There are a LOT of artifacts inside and it",
          "The exhibits are arranged very well with a nice flow from one to the other. The lighting is good. They have a lot of great pieces from the Roman period in Lyon.",
          "We walked down to the museum after visiting the Bascilica. Audio guides were complimentary and helpful to understand the exhibits. We learned a lot about the early history of Lyon. Most of the items on display were found in Lyon. You can also check your coats for free which",
          "Well worth a visit, the layout of the museum is on several floors with a viewing area for the amphitheater below. There are probably too many large stone exhibits which are similar however there are some wonderful pieces to see, the mosaic floors being the highlight. A visit",
          "This museum does a tremendous job of documenting and illustrating the ancient history of Lyon. From inside the museum, you can enjoy remarkable views of the Roman Amphitheater. This is well worth the trip!",
          "Most do not think of the Roman finger print on France. They were there when most inhabitants of Gall were in grass huts. Displayed is mostly the every day objects of a civilization. Lead drain pipes and vessels are well preserved, and if you like ancient things this is a good",
          "Built into the hillside adjacent to the Roman Amphitheatres. It contains more than just roman artifacts. Excellent layout . Some great mosaics. Bronze Chariot is magnificent. Loved the windows looking out onto the Amphitheatres linked the displays with the builings really well.",
          "The museum is in a very interesting building extending down the hillside with views back over the ruins. A very interesting exhibition is on a the moment about the water supply to Lyon. Some of the exhibits have English and French signage but the English tends to be much smaller",
          "The museum is not huge but large enough to be educational. Provides a good understanding of the historical development and importance of Lyon.",
          "The museum is located next to the Theatre of Fourviere in Lyon. You do not need a museum ticket to visit the theatre since entry to the theatre is free, so if your intention is to visit the theatre, save your money on museum ticket. The museum has historical artefacts from Lyon,",
          "This museum is housed in a modern building, and through 2 large windows overlooks the Roman amphitheatre, but is otherwise hidden from view from the amphitheatre. The museum is clustered around themes, which works very well. The exhibit starts with some pre-Roman artefacts,",
          "For anyone interested in history: this is a modern, architecturally well-designed museum, about 100 m. from the Basilica Notre Dame in Old (Vieux) Lyon and overlooking two well-preserved Roman-era amphitheaters. If you read French, you'll do well on your own; if not, even",
          "The highlights of this Museum is Mosaic! It worth takes time to enjoy them. It let us understand more about Gallo.",
          "Excellent archaeological museum in a hill next to the remains of a massive Roman amphitheatre (visit the museum first and then take a stroll through the ruins). The museum boasts an extensive, well curated collection of Gallo-Roman artefacts housed on multiple floors including",
          "This museum provides a wonderful picture of this Roman city in Gaul. It's not expensive admission and is extraordinarily well done. Free audio guide provides excellent commentary. Don't miss it!",
          "This is one of the best Roman history museums I have visited. Given the importance of Gaul (roughly France) in boosting the rise of Julius Cesar and the subsequent rise of Rome as an empire, this museum is a must while in Lyon. It's architecture is amazing and the collection not",
          "This Museum is located right beside the two Roman amphitheaters in the Fourviere area and connected via funicular to public transit. The museum appears quite small from the outside, but was built right into the hill with only a few obvious windows and the main entrance peeking",
          "This is a beautiful museum of five levels. The structure fits into a wall area next to the ROMAN theatre. The level entry is either at the first floor or fifth. You get the audio guide on the fifth level. The museum is very informative and ideal as a teaching tool.",
          "If you are interested in the early Roman times this is a good museum to visit while in Lyon. Lots of mosaic floors, carvings and artifacts. It has a good window view of the Roman amphitheater (although the window was in needs of cleaning when we were there). We had the Lyon",
          "I enjoy visiting Roman foundations of cities, and I happen to like looking at the artifacts, etc, due to my interest in history. I loved the mosaics! I was there on a free admission day. The exhibits are well labeled in English, but one can also rent an audio guide. I did see",
          "Great trip to the roots of our civilization and great moment in world history to do it. Doesn't let you forget what the animals want to destroy.",
          "Archeology yielded rich troves of Lyon's ancient past and the artefacts are very well lit, captioned and displayed. I also enjoyed the modern architecture and its airy spaces although the whole museum is underground.",
          "Audio tour is recommended; Cheap; Takes around a hour; Cool visualisation/model; Adds a whole chapter to the history of Lyon, one i didn't know; Interesting surrounding which you can't miss out on;",
          "An inexpensive informative way to learn about the early history of Lyon (Lugdunum). The included audio guide was very informative and the displays were well preserved/restored. A good way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "Impressive collection of Roman artifacts found in Lyon, formerly Lugdunum during Roman times. Just a few euros for entrance, which included the audioguide. We spent over an hour here. The museum building itself was modern and uncluttered, and interesting in itself.",
          "Hidden in the hill is collection of antiuities from Lyon. Comprehensive display of things that last several thousand years and more plus the ruin, The whole area has a history. It's on the top of a hill if you are going to walk.",
          "The museum shows a lot of the artifacts from the Roman ruins. Very informative and some interesting details and information provided. Beautiful views out onto the ruins.",
          "This is an outstanding museum. It's right next to the great amphitheater, which you walk through alongside the stage in order to enter. I believe it was very recently completed, and the design, lighting, displays, are all of the first order. The English-language signage is",
          "This museum is a wonderful display of sophisticated Roman life as it existed in Gaul during the empire. Beautiful mosaic floors, stoneware, statuary and items of luxury and daily living are very nicely displayed and visible from multiple levels as one tours the museum on gentle",
          "4 floors of antiquities! Takes you right back 2000 years. So well displayed and interesting. Make plenty of time as this museum is well worth at least 1/2 a day to explore. Right next to the Forum.",
          "I wish I had spent more time viewing all of the exhibits. The architect did a marvelous job capturing the intent of the many exhibits. The mosaics were exquisite.",
          "We came from the packed square of the Basilique to this almost empty museum filled with Roman pottery, inscriptions, and wonderfully preserved mosaic floors. I am more amazed by the Roman culture every time I visit one of their sites or museums.",

          "We enjoyed a self-guided tour of this very thorough look into Lyon's ancient history. Numbered among their objects were Roman sling shot balls, in tact Roman glass jars, and Roman era tacky tourist souvenirs. The museum was very informative, but a number of objects were missing",
          "The museum is adjacent to a pair of Roman ampitheaters and has \"light cannons\" that look out over them. There's an excellent collection of artifacts and a free English languae audioguide that leads you through the exhibits. I particularly enjoyed the large floor mosaics,",

          "I have seen more than my share of museums centered around Roman archeology but none has come close to this one. We were fortunate enough to be given free tickets by a friendly French couple but the admission - cheap at any rate - would be well worth it. The fact that the",

          "Awesome spot to tour. The ruins outside are free to walk around. You can even climb on them, which was fun for the kids. The museum itself is much larger than it appears from the outside, as most of it is embedded in the hillside. Lots of \u2026",
          "This place is unreal. Imagine sharing the same space as people thousands of years ago. The amphitheater is still in use and while we were there, they were dismantling a stage that was constructed for a performance. The amphitheater is \u2026",
          "One of the most interesting and beautiful places in Lyon! Must be visited at least once! Don't miss visiting the museum that's hidden inside the rocks beside the theatre!",

          "Roman ruins free entry.\nMuseum built next door for cheap entry.\nVery nice set up with a few floors of artifacts.\nThere is a great view of ruins around side of museum from road access.",
          "It was one of the national days of archaeology when I visited the museum.  Besides the free entrance,  there were all sorts of activities for young children! Really impressive!! The archaeological site outside the museum is nice to walk \u2026",
          "Worth a look if you're there. The adjacent Roman Theatres are worth a visit and the museum itself will appeal to those who are academically interested in the Roman history of Lugdunum. It doesn't however make the most of the collection and has a decidedly pedestrian presentation.  Avoid if you have children.",

          "This museum situated in a natural amphitheater on the mount in Fourvi\u00e8re is a must see on your trip to Lyon. Nestled beside the Roman theatre and Odeon ruins which are magnificent in themselves, this museum brings to life the ancient \u2026",

          "It's a great historical experience with audioguides and authentic descent underground! Totally worth it!",
          "The museum is beautiful and cheap to get in. Also, it is accessible for everyone since the exhibition is always going down without stairs. Finally, you can access the theaters outside which are beautiful!",
          "Impressive Roman site. Well preserved. Worth a visit!",
          "This was a really nice experience! Informative and easy to follow. The museum tells an engaging story. My only reason for holding back one star, is the lack of coverage of the christian religion, so important through half of the roman era, \u2026",
          "The mosaics are stunning. Good accompanying texts and audio guide, also in English.",
          "Interesting exibits, however the woman on the English audio guide has a very distracting speech impediment. Words like \"pwababwy\" instead of \"probably\" over and over.",

          "Really great views of the city from atop the ampitheatre, the museum had written information en francais and in English throughout which made it easy for a quick visit. There was a large kid friendly interactive play area which would be nice for families. We loved it and learned a lot!",
          "Interesting, but not particularly well organised.",
          "Nice place, you don't have to pay to get there and it's very well conserved.",

          "Kids will love the special games exhibit!",
          "Worth a visit if you are in Lyon, but not worth a trip there. Some excellent mosaics and, of course, the ruins of a Roman amphitheatre. Numismatists will be disappointed. Lugdunnum was home to an Imperial mint, but the coin collection on display is remarkably poor.",
          "An absolute must if you are interested in gallo roman history. The city of lyon to this day is uncovering artifacts around the area helping solve its historical puzzle. The amphitheatre beside the museum is incredible.",

          "Interesting and with lots of well-conserved pieces. Audioguide is quite interesting",
          "You need to have a pair of comfortable shoes to walk around this site. The inside of museum is fine, but the roads of amphitheater are sometimes rough. Lovely scenary, worth going there.",
          "With beautiful Architecture, history, cuisine, shopping streets and 2 rivers, Lyon has so much to offer. Visited this place while coming back from Noter-dam and its full of history, culture and you can also take good shots of Lyon City from here.",
          "An architecture student must visit this to study the structure",
          "Free on first Sunday of the month. Definitely worth a visit. Modern design. Tidy, spacious and a lot of clear information. Not everything has English translation but the fact that some do is good enough. There are two windows looking out to the theatres outside. ",
          "It\u2019s a well preserved Roman site.",
          "Amazing view of the city.",

          "Amazing to see ruins that have been here for millennia. I was surprised that the ruins weren't more protected and you are able to walk up them and climb on top of them. The view if the city from the top of the site was great. There is also a museum here.",
          "Not much to see here but the museum is interesting if you are like to know what kind of thing that the Roman left behind.",
          "Huge but informative - get the audioguide and enjoy the incredible, huge mosaics they have her, as well as a great view of the Amphitheatre itself.",
          "Fantastic museum. A definite must see when in Lyon. The museum houses artifacts from the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, the Antiquities and more. A good deal of the artifacts came from excavations in and around Lyon. Some even came from locals \u2026",

          "Really great museum! Exceeded my expectations",
          "Spectacularly good museum - amazing Roman relics both inside and outside, glorious architecture, and good job at contextualising/explaining the story of Gallo-Romans. Parts of the display are a bit dated and could do with re-labelling, and the lack of a caf\u00e9 is a missed opportunity given the wonderful setting.",

Internally, it is formed of a concrete spiral ramp descending and branching out into the display rooms. It is managed and operated by the Metropolis of Lyon jointly with the archaeological museum of Saint-Romain-en-Gal.

          "The amphitheater in conjunction with the Gallo-Roman Museum is worth a visit. The Museum does an excellent job of giving the history of Lyon and the models of the theater really explain how the amphitheater was built into the hillside. I agree with the signage comment. I am",
          "There are two magnificent theaters built on the Roman era. Both are very well preserved . There are nicely well located on a slope of the Fourviere hill and from there you could have a nice view to the city. In the summer , on that place, there is a festival of music, operas",
          "well preserved but poor signage...you had to know what you were looking at..shame the museum to explain it was closed",
          "Our tour bus climbed up Fourviere Hill passing the Roman Amphitheater and slowing down for a quick picture taking. The theatre has magnificent view and overlooks the city",
          "It's a must to visit the Romans theatre who is in a good condition, a historical place de Fourviere and a great view, to recommend tor archaeologique interesting friends",
          "The historical amphitheatres with old world charm leave you awestruck at the engineering marvels of bygone centuries! Though much smaller than the Roman Colosseum but still retain the roman flavour preserved ! Well manicured garden around it adds the French touch. Just 10",
          "Well worth the walk after visiting the basilica. Excellent presentation and a lovely place to sit on a sunny winter\u2019s morning.",
          "It was funny to me that the basilica up the hill had a big sign in the doorway warning visitors to watch out for pickpockets ... until a pickpocket got me behind a stone wall in the Theatres Romains de Fourviere. We've visited Roman ruins all over the world, and they never fail",
          "Not much to be done but beautiful place. Hear rock concerts are held here from time to time and that must be an experience. Definitely worth a visit",
          "This is on the way down (or up) from Notre Dame Fouviere, but is even worth a separate trip on its own. It is very large and quite impressive. It is amazing how much is still intact. The area is open and you can walk around for free. I saw a museum entrance, but I didn\u2019t go",
          "View on Alpes by a nice weather, you will see different theater : music, games and street on the top with house and streets",
          "This place has it all with the Roman amphitheaters and the great views of the city. If you're into history this is a must stop...even if you're not you should get up there just for the views. Leave time to explore, more than just a photo opp.",
          "I had read about the Roman ruins on Fourviere Hill before our visit to Lyon and did not want to miss seeing these spectacular ruins. The site is free of charge, but you will probably not want to walk up the hill on foot, it is very steep and will tire out almost any traveler.",
          "This is also known as Lugdunum. It gives you a sense of enormity of time and place, being 2000 years old. Just walking around in it and thinking about that is quite something. It's free and a really good thing to experience.",
          "I have been to lots of amplhtheatres and have declaimed experimentally from the focus point. My partner had not and found it fun, particularly from the smaller one. Do test the acoustics for yourself",
          "I went here by accident with my friend. from away when you look at it, it seems nothing but when you actually go and walk on it, it is breathtaking, the steps are so high and the stones are big. A nice place to take a walk and see a view of Lyon from the top.",
          "You can very well imagine how that teather used to be 2000 years ago! I only missed a bit more of explanations in place, but the guidebook I have from Lyon covered this.",
          "It was incredible to stand at the top of the theatre and to look down - the sheer size of it is impressive, and what is there today is only a part of it!",
          "It is amazing that these ruins are so intact. The ancient Roman theater has multiple sections. You can sit there and ponder life as it was then. It's hard to fathom how long ago it was built.",
          "You can walk through the ruins free of charge, 2 ancient amphitheaters located next to each other that are still used for performances. Don't miss the museum!",
          "We are still amaze how they are able to engineer this theater when there are no speakers or microphones in those days. Try them yourself.",
          "An extensive roman site. Well laid out with museum. Easy to use oget to using the funicular. Teens found it interestingly laid out and we had plenty of time to mooch about and take in the views. We didn't go to the museum as we were a bit time constrained.",
          "These two Roman amphitheatres are amazing to walk around. And they are about the only bit of free history in Europe . The Roman museum next door has a small charge, but has a large array of Roman stories and parts of buildings saved from Lyon.",
          "Such a sight to see amongst a neighbourhood! Definitely bigger than I thought and it is worth the walk to to see it and wander around! Great knowing that it is taken care of so well and the history of it very important to the people of Lyon!",
          "We couldn't believe these foundations are still here from the time of Jesus! So amazing to see and walk through. Very large. Mind blowing to think the people put this all together so long ago. Kudos to the major who preserved it. The museum has lots of interesting pieces as",
          "Segment 3 on the audio guide with a model of the topography was worth the stop if you care about ancient history.",
          "We hiked up the hill to visit the Basilica and the ruins. This was super interesting to see and it would be awesome to attend a concert there, as the theatre is currently in use today.",
          "In America, we thrill to seeing something 100 years old. Seeing a 2000-year-old theater is simply an extraordinary experience. Just close your eyes and imagine Roman legionnaires sitting in those seats, which are still used today.",

          "Looks very cool from the top but wanted to view it from the bottom so asked if we could use the elevator (that they have at least two of in the museum might I point out). Point blank no. Pointed it out that it was for disibilty which meant neither my mother or I can get down,",
          "These ruins are right next to the funicular railway station \u201cFourvi\u00e8re\u201d, which is a fun journey and only minutes from central Lyon. There are actually two theatres here. A larger one and a smaller one. It is quite an impressive sight. As well as the theatres themselves, there",
          "It is probably a bit unfair to describe the theatre as ruins as open-air events are still held here, but what is left is just a shadow of the original structure the Romans built. The original theatre was built around 15 BC, and was 90m in diameter. At the beginning of the 2nd",
          "Two Roman theaters on a hillslope. In rather good condition still. Free entry. Handy access from Vieux Nice m\u00e9tro station via funicular. Good information plaques.",
          "This site represents the power of the Roman culture and architecture. The site was clean and well maintained and the access was easy.",
          "On approaching the museum we could see a small entrance with the backdrop of the roman ruins, I thought there would be a small exhibition before exiting into the ruins, how wrong I was! This building is cleverly built into its landscape as to be almost invisible from the outside",
          "Two Roman amphitheaters side by side (one still in use) and an excellent museum. The floor mosaics excavated from local sites are visually stunning. Lots of artifacts also. Figure on an hour in the museum if not more.",
          "Historical sight are always great to see. Especially in Europe. This is another location that is worth a visit. It is not as great as the one in Orange, FR, but it is worth visiting while in Lyon.",
          "Lots of items on display. Easy to walk through the exhibits. Amazing how the amphitheater has been maintained.",
          "Another climb is required, but worth it. Well preserved/maintained sections which are still used today, and more historic original bits.",
          "Definitely a must see on any visit to Lyon and easy to do the Old town and Notre-Dame at the same time. It would be great to see a concert here.",
          "Short walk from the Basilica to see some amazing ruins of what was an ancient Roman theatre built on the hill of Fourvi\u00e8re.",
          "Not so far from the top of the hill overlooking the city. You can go nearby overlooking site, think there is also museum but we did not go inside.",
          "I was amazed by all the Roman history in Lyon, did not know any of that. Good ruins to walk around, we love Roman history. If we had time, I would have loved to go to the Roman museum.",
          "The site is grand with a deep history. A guided tour or a self-study prior to a visit would be very helpful. Our visit was obstructed and blocked off by a festival preparation. We could only walk along the pathway above the amphitheatre where ruins of galleries/rooms, columns,",
          "The kids loved this location. Compared to Nimes, they liked the ability to jump and climb on the ruins. It's a great location looking out onto Lyon. You can see the aqueduct sections as well as see small portions of mosaics. They still use one side of the theatre for concerts",
          "Now this is an absoluite do not miss on your visit to Lyon. Tavel up by Fun icular from the city below, visit and take time, it has so much from roman art, sculture, artifacts and so much evidence of the daily life of the residents of this once great Roman capiutal of central",
          "It was fun to walk around the area and see the ruins, you have good access to everything. It looks like it would be a cool place to see a concert as well.",
          "The history here is amazing and just thinking about how old this place is just boggles our minds. We loved seeing the view as well.",
          "A lot to see here and plenty of space to sit down and really appreciate the place. It is a must see place",
          "Wished we got there earlier! Watched a practice for an evening concert which was awesome. This is why we ran out of time to walk the ruins . The climb and stairs are physically tiring and out in the hot sun (we visited in July during a hot spell ). We took the Vernicular up and",
          "Two fairly intact Roman theaters being used in summer for concerts, plays and operas. So cool to make functional use of the enduring work of the Romans. We watched a band sound check and warm up, including 1/2 hr of songs. Was so fun to think of Romans sitting here 2000 years",
          "We walked by it first on the way down from the basilica. At that point I was too tired to walk up the steps to the top. So, we came back a few days later and walked all over it. We came at it from down by Cathedral St. Jean, so it was a fair hike up. At first, it was",
          "This place was very cool to wander around, but it was a little bit underwhelming. I definitely recommend going up the funicular and seeing it, as any sort of ancient Roman architecture is awesome, but I think I expected a better view of it and less modernization. Also, if you go",
          "It really evokes another time and does feel like the Romans had been there. They love a good amphitheatre and what a setting too. You can see the cityscape. They were setting up for a concert too, amazing the site is still being used for entertaining the people",
          "The theater is an awesome place that is even better because it is still used. There is a great museum, which is unassuming from the out side but huge inside and very interesting. My favorite stop in Lyon.",
          "We could not get into the museum because the power was out. We were able to walk the ruins and the stands. A band was setting up for a concert. Check out the schedules. It would be an awesome concert venue.",
          "Pretty well-preserved ruins with lots of history beneath your feet as you climb and try to imagine all the things that have occurred here in the last 2000 years. Great concert spot in the summer also!",
          "A great sight to see the ruins. Love that they have created a modern stage to continue using the space. History meets modern times created with thoughtful respect. Visited the museum yoo. Love the building layout and detail.",
          "I love exploring the Roman remains and architecture and this is no exception. Take the funicular to the top and it is just a five minute walk and you can walk all through the remains of the theatre for free. So much is still intact though obviously many parts have been",
          "While the ruins on their own are very cool (the lower portion has been rebuilt), its worth it to wait for an event and see an actual show in the theater and imagine what it was like in ancient times.",
          "I\u2019m a theater professional so for me this was a must see and I was not disappointed. It\u2019s a beautiful place and it\u2019s lovely to see that it\u2019s being used with respect still. We didn\u2019t go to the museum next to it but will definitely come back as the museum looked very nice.",
          "These Roman ruins are great to explore! You could probably walk through in 5 minutes, but I spent about an hour here, exploring around and reading the signs. It\u2019s tricky to find the entrance without visiting the museum, but it\u2019s just down the hill from Fourvi\u00e8re. Use your GPS",
          "The architecture alone of the facility is quite stunning. The artifacts and collection of Roman things is pretty astounding. You get a free audio guide with admission. You can also see the amphitheater and other ruins right outside when you finish at the museum.",
          "An amazing and extensive place to visit, free of charge. Great to see the extent of the work completed hundreds of years ago. Don\u2019t miss seeing this on your trip to Lyon, recommend visiting.",
          "This is a nice place to visit though there is a museum there is a fee to enter - we skipped that so maybe check it out to give you more context without context it is just a nice walk",
          "You don\u2019t need to go through the museum to walk round the amphitheater and this is one of the most extensive outside of Rome. The main part is incredibly well preserved and there are great views of the Basilica, the river and Lyon",
          "This is a nice place to see and a must do if you are at the Notre Dame in Lyon. Lot of Ancient structures from the Roman period. It also has a few easy hikes up and down the theater.",
          "This is a touch of a thousand-year history. A well-preserved amphitheater and a stunning view of the city",
          "Amazing and who would have expected to see this in France. I am fairly certain that you have to go through the museum to access the amphitheatre. We did and loved it.",
          "Next to the Gallo Roman museum which is by the way very interesting you find the 2 Roman theatres. In summer used for performances. Access is free and as they are very close to the Basilica Notre Dame de Fourviere worth a visit. You can reach it via the funicular.",
          "We couldn\u2019t fine out how to get close but we could see people down there and we could see them from on high",
          "Still in use today it says a lot about Roman design and building over 2000 years ago. Stop here if you are taking the Hop On hop Off bus then walk up the hill to the basilica.",
          "A really nice place to see and to be astonished about what the romans managed to build. Imagining the way it used to be is not that easy. Sadly some parts are being used for a theater and you cant go there. The walkways are uneven and there are tons of stairs so don\u2019t take a",
          "We stopped by the Roman ruins to see it, as we had heard it was amazing. We enjoyed it. However we did not go into the museum.",
          "This is the best ruin ( which is rebuilt in places) of an amphitheater I have ever seen. It is massive and the acoustics are unbelievable. It is as is was 2000 years ago and it is used for concerts in the summer. A must see and plan to spend an hour or two here.",
          "Even more impressive if you see the reconstruction in the museum. So go back after visiting the museum and imagine how it was all those years ago.",
          "Be careful of the uneven surfaces, especially after the rain. This is a must see place to visit with some lunch spots nearby.",
          "Admittedly we didn\u2019t go into the associated museum, but thought there was a lack of info amongst the ruins themselves. The ruins are well preserved & clearly work is ongoing but it would appear the theatre is still used as such",
          "The theater is on the same hill as the Basillica so when you are done with the church just walk a short way to the ruins. It's wide open and in good shape and the view of Lyon is wonderful.",
          "We went on a Monday \u2014 museum was closed. However, the grounds were free and open to admission. You are allowed to explore for as long as you want. Pretty darn cool. A few more information plaques would be beneficial (but museum probably has maps, etc). A definite must go see.",
          "This was completed in 15BC and it still is standing. It is amazing that the Romans built this back then. The seating is so level. The smaller Odeon floor is amazing. Definitely worth seeing.",
          "we visited the Theatres Romains during the f\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res in December 2018 and we were amazed by the installations put up. The site is extremely well maintained as is everything in France!",
          "Visually terrific. Alas, there is not much information provided on the occasional placard .... the information could have been better",
          "it's pretty incredible to be seating in a Roman amphitheater as big as this one. Try to visit it in summer where you can come here to listen to outdoor concert. Just don't forget to bring a pillow or rent one as the stones are hard to seat on !",
          "At the top of the hill and reached the site of the former roman city of Lugdunum. Here we found the well preserved remains of the Ancient Roman Theatre, built in 1st century BC, and right next to the smaller Odeon. Dominating a privileged point on top of the hill over the river",
          "A gorgeous reminder of what Lyon was. An important colony for the romans and a commercial and military spot for the empire. Come and enjoy the view and the museum beside!",
          "Once you are up in the Fourvi\u00e8re it is a 3 min walk to vis\u00edte the theater. As all Roman ruins it is impressed! This theater is very big and you will get impressed!!",
          "See these with the Museum. We did not see productions, if there are any, but the theaters themselves are impressive reminders of the extraordinary culture that once prevailed in the area.",
          "Amazing Roman theater build in 15 B.C., and yet has survived. Large portions of the theater have destroyed or fallen down due to age. However, this is still an item I highly recommend seeing. Additionally, it is located right next to the Roman Gallo Museum. So, if you go to",
          "Roman ruins .. and a museum on site too Great site to wander around and discover .. Music concerts & theatrical events are held here in the summer months .. Visit in the afternoon before the event .. and listen / watch the preformer's practice their sets Excellent afternoon's",
          "The Romans knew a thing or two about building. The remains of the amphitheatre is indeed impressive, as is the ruins of a smaller theatre on the same site. A visit is highly recommended.",
          "Take funicular from the bottom of the hill or after visiting Notre dame Cath\u00e9drale, you can walk 5 min to the ruins. Such magnificent site as you walk up to , you will find more steps. At the top you will have unobstructed view of the other side of Lyon. Must visited site of",
          "This should be on top of your list when visiting Lyon. The ruins are massive and very well preserved. It is a wonderful history lesson and window into the past,",
          "These are some truly amazing ruins of the Roman amphitheaters located atop the hillside overlooking Lyon and the Rhone River. The construction are just a testament to the civil engineering expertise of the Romans. Well worth visiting and exploring these historic ruins.",
          "It really always amazes me the chance to admire any Roman Ruins anywhere in Europe!!! Constructed around 15 B.C, the amphitheatre is still standing in a great condition!!! Lovely views from the hills above!!! Basically a free attraction!!!",
          "There are two theatres, a large one and a smaller \"Odeon\" and the two amphitheatres are spectacular and well worth a visit.",
          "Walking up to the Roman remains is a nice scenic adventure. Once you are up here, the remains of the theater are free for exploring, with very few barriers. Along with the theater, there are remnants of buildings and other unknown remains that you and the children are free to",
          "We're interested in classical history and have visited hundreds of Greek and Roman sites throughout Europe. The Roman theater in Lyon is above average, but the museum itself is great. Not only well curated in general, it also contains a very large set of Roman mosaic floors.",
          "This is a cool place to visit if you appreciate that this was built around the time of Christ. It had become overgrown and forgotten but was found by a gardener cearing some brush and then excavated.",
          "Took the family out for a great long walk and some sightseeing and we weren\u2019t pleasantly surprised to find this beautiful place! You can opt to take the longer way or do some leg work by using the \u201cshortcut\u201d stairs :) absolutely recommend for a nice walk and sightseeing!",
          "A nice place that cannot be missed while at Lyon. It is old history, and a sample of what Lyon was arrumad the time of Christ.",
          "But these are not the most impressive Roman Theater ruins that there are. What is nice is that they have been repaired enough to still be usable for concerts and events. The site is quite imposing. Those Romans sure had to walk a lot uphill to see a show!",
          "Whilst visiting the Basilica you must go see the Roman amphitheatre. Lovely gardens surround it and it\u2019s beautiful to sit and listen to the birds around the gardens.",
          "These roman ruins are quite extensive and provide excellent views of the city as well. there is also a very famous museum to visit. I think its a must see for visitors to Lyon.",
          "Yes, you can sit in the very amphitheatre that Caligula sat and watched the Roman games. The amphitheatre is in a fantastic spot with great views over Lyon, definitely worth a visit.",
          "The best collection of well preserved and large mosaics we have ever seen. Fantastic condition and well lit, lots of other interesting things to see as well. Opens at 11a.m, closed Tuesdays",
          "This place has amazing history behind it from the Celts, the Franks, and the Gauls. This place is well worth seeing.",
          "I brought my sister and her family here for an afternoon picnic and it was wonderful. Get to explore the ruins, not very crowded, awesome view. Its free to enter when there are no events going on. My 4 year old niece was able to wander around and climb on some of the walls.",
          "We took the tram up and saw that this was a midway stop, so we went, These are just ruins from long ago but, it was a nice visit and its free, You just walk around and imagine what it was light eons ago when it was built,",
          "The theatre really gives you an experience that has an eeriness attached to it, apart from the spectacular views, the workmanship & methods of building this theatre into the hill is quite something. Great place to just sit & contemplate living in the past. It\u2019s enormity is only",
          "The museum is very reasonably priced at 4\u20ac and very well designed as well. The audio devices work well but the wall numbers can be difficult to find. The information cards are placed quite low and are hard to read. More audio information would be helpful. Worth a visit..",
          "I walked up and the view is stunning. It\u2019s one of the great historical site that you should not miss. If you want to visit the museum, you should pay extra 2,5 \u20ac. The toilet is not very clean but free.",
          "Would definitely recommend a visit here - especially if you're a fan of Roman history. Lots to see and do.",
          "I had no idea that there was a Roman amphitheatre in Lyon, and this one is well worth a visit. Take the funiculaire or 15 min steep walk up to the top of Fourviere for beautiful views of the city and then head down about 3 min the other way to explore the ruins1",
          "We were amazed at the integrity of the Roman theatre! Just so nice to get to a historical site like this and not have it made into a tourist spot! You are free to enter, walk around, leisurely sit in the over 2000 year old bleachers. There are enough information posts around to",
          "Unfortunately, only got a glimpse of this, but what we saw was impressive...happy to see that the authorities maintain this important architectural site..",
          "Check visiting hours, the theatre is fenced off only accessible during opening hours of the museum. Like most roman architecture, it's just wall basements that have survived millenials, so don't expect too much",
          "These are old roman ruins that are still used today. If you are going to the Basilica, go via the ruins on the way down, they are worth a look and they are on the way down.",
          "This Roman ruin is a must see on your travels and the attached modern museum is well thought out and amazing. We have never seen mosaic as wonderful. Headphones are provided to explain the exhibits.",
          "I really enjoy this part of the city. The view is really breathtaking! You will also like to spend some Time walking around this very peacefull place. Take your favorite book, sit in the sun and enjoy a restfull Time! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude0e",
          "I am always fascinated to see how wide the scope of the Roman Empire! Having visited the arena in Arles, it was even more interesting to see these ruins in Lyon. Pass them on the way to the Notre Dame de Fourviere Basilica. You can take the funicular if you wish. Astounding",
          "Walking down into the main Amphitheatre takes you back to the Roman era. The complex of access ways, seats and steps let you know how well the Romans organised this form of entertainment. A thoroughly enjoyable experience",
          "You should visit this place going to the hill. There is a very historic place with great city view. It's very close by walk to go to the Basilique Notre Dame de Fourviere.",
          "Came here one afternoon, and it is a great place to see ancient roman ruins. Best way to see it is to take the funicular up and just walk down. Lots of things to see. A bit of a shame that they have big poles up in the middle for music venues, but I guess it is the sign of",
          "This is free to go into and walk around the remains- not much information about but good to see. Would be good for young children.",
          "We walked up to Fourviere, instead of taking the funicular. The walk wasn't that bad. We loved the Roman Theatre. It was amazing to think that about 1600 years ago the Gauls walked where we walked. The ruins are well preserved and bigger than we thought. The Lyonese built a",
          "Love Roman ruins and Th\u00e9\u00e2tres Romains de Fourvi\u00e8re didn\u2019t disappoint, they are pretty amazing. The theatre and odeon perched up high on Fourvi\u00e8re Hill looking over Lyon has wonderful views of the city. Fourvi\u00e8re Hill was settled in 43BC with the capital Lugdunum, considered",
          "Worth a visit on the walk down from the Notre Damme de Fourvi\u00e8re as it\u2019s historic and very well kept. It\u2019s a bit disappointing that they would prefer to keep the stages and lighting in place rather than keeping the charm of the history. Still enjoyed it",
          "What a gem. I just loved visiting this ancient theatre. We got to see a concert here and if you get a chance don\u2019t miss it.",
          "Great historical site in the lovely, quaint area of Fourvi\u00e8re. Stunning panoramic views to Lyon. It\u2019s free to wander around, unless there is a ticketed event on. Definitely worth a visit to ponder your thoughts on what once may have occurred in such a location years gone by!!",
          "This old roman theater can be foud nestled in between modern buildings, on top of Lyon. Great piece of history saved. They throw modern concerts here now and it is truly spectacular to see the old and new come together.",
          "Very nice place , with traditional Roman architecture : semicircular spectator area with several entrances and exits and stage with colorful tiles",
          "If you have a chance to attend a music event or festival, don't hesitate and GOOOO! We were fortunate enough to attend a concert by Bernard Lavilliers during the \"night at la Fourvi\u00e8re\". This is a magic place and organisation was brilliant also in terms of public transportation.",
          "Walking thru this site was fun. The museum has many stone relics from the past. Mozaics were beautiful. The on/off bus was fun in Lyon. The funicular was unusual.",
          "A really nicely preserved Roman Theatre. If you get off the funicular at the Roman Theatre stop you have an uphill hike to the bottom of the roman theatre and then you still have a hike up the steps of the theatre. It's better to take the funicular to the basilica and walk",
          "The Theatre, Odeon and other remains against such a view/backdrop are worth a visit, alone. The interpretation tables are worthy of the 1960s in their number ( too few) and content (very shallow). The museum itself has some amazing exhibits (and is itself an amazing piece of",
          "As the heat was oppressing the walk up the steep stairs wasn't easy but totally worth the effort. To imagine that These theatres were built in the 2nd century is amazing and it is still used totday as a place for theatre and concerts. Beautiful view of the City. Clrea",
          "Worth seeing the ruins if you are in the area. I love the way the amphitheater is used for concerts and performances today. Wander at will over the steps and paths. You can pay to enter the museum.",
          "We knew we had to visit the site before we left Lyon, wow , I am glad we did it is just incredible. Well preserved , people can actually walk around the site, have a picnic , the view in incredible. We did not visit the museum as the outdoor one gave us everything we needed. I",
          "These are two fine Roman theatres next to each other and with amazing views over the city but during the summer they are turned into concert venues and the ancient atmosphere is lost because there are large modern stages erected together with all the other paraphernalia that",
          "May be it will look better in 1 years time as there was a lot of building material and workers around.",
          "Worth a visit if you are interested in Roman ruins. Easy to get to on the funicular railway. 2 good sized amphitheatres that are still used today. A lot of the ruins and other areas on the site have been repaired and restored, so not all authentic Roman aged elements. Good",
          "Interesting ancient arena that\u2019s been part of the history of this beautiful city for hundreds of years. Amazed at the condition it\u2019s in. Better preserved that you\u2019d think was possible. Worth a look for sure.",
          "Can you imagine sitting down somewhere and knowing other people have been sitting in the exact same spot for 2000years. Well you can here. The history here. You have 2 theatres here to roam round .",
          "Theatres Romains is a must see in Lyon, but the real treat is the excellent museum. Please give yourself time to go through this amazing museum. It\u2019s next to the amphitheater. Use the self-guided tour and stroll for as long as you wish. This is the best way to understand the",
          "Roman ruins, 10,000 seats, festivals still organised here. A point of referencenin Lyon's history. A must see if you trully want to learn the history of this important city.",
          "We strolled through here after visiting the basilica as it is just down the road. If you have time to visit then go and see the ruins",
          "5 minutes walk from the Basilica. Excellently maintained, and you can wander all around the site. Some fantastic views of Lyon from the top of the Arena - well worth a visit",
          "Taking the funicular up was quick and easy. Once up top we were able to explore the ruins and take in the views of the city. Very nice! Hiking back down was fine and was not too long or too strenuous.",
          "This theatre is fantastic, so well preserved and just an awesome and such an awesome sight to see. Must see attraction on your way to the museum and the the cathedral. There is no entrance fee as far i can gather - i did use my lyon card to get into the museum though.",
          "This place is on the highest part of Lyon, really close to the cathedral. It's really peacefull and the view is just awesome. A must see in Lyon.",
          "The amazing architecture that dated back centuries ago and you can only imagine when looking at the site, the crowds of people that would visit to watch a show or some form of entertainment. To think they thought of the creative design and structure way back then just blows your",
          "Very impressive, but it would be better if we could read signs explaining the meaning of the buildings and constructions. But the visit in this place is obviously mandatory.",
          "We were unable to wander everywhere here because some areas were closed while a concert was being set up. However if you are interested in Roman history there are some very well preserved aspects and a small museum",
          "Was surprised to be able to enter the Roman theatre for free - a nice surprise. Great location for it, up on the hill. Gets the imagination going.",
          "There are a number of amphitheaters in Lyon, however I think this one is the best. Set on the hillside it is open (without charge) for the visitor to meander through and soak up the atmosphere of days gone by. There isn\u2019t any information about the site readily available,",
          "This may be a hot walk up layers of stairs for you but persevere because this Theatre (for 20,000 Gauls and a few Romans) and the smaller Odeon next door are magnificently preserved. And from the top there are wonderful views over Lyon.",
          "In one of the most important city of the Roman empire, you must not loose the opportunity of being in a Theatre, as the people use to do in that time. Well maintained and well explained, it's magnificent and glorious. There are some music concerts,during the winter and summer.",
          "I was visiting this place with school and hoped to visit this in my free time because I really like the history of a city , this perfectly captures a part of this history. Was planning to go by a rented bike but that was a mistake from my part it was quite high so left the bike",
          "The ruins of the Roman theatre are amazing. The museum next to them is great. It is well planned with good flow from one exhibit to another. The labels are are all in French but you're there to see the exhibits which speak for themselves.",
          "Enjoyed seeing ...doesn\u2019t take long....half an hour, but then we went on to museum which had a great special exhibit on water that was very interesting....enjoyed regular exhibits too such as seeing the mosaic floors, and archaeological findings from Lyon and area.",
          "After a very short walk from the Basilique of Notre Dame we were amazed at this beautifully preserved Roman remains. You can really feel like you had stepped back in time. The museum was interesting and gave window views from inside there. You are able to sit and take it all in",
          "It's amazing to find such ruins still in place and well preserved. If you choose to walk from Vieux Lyon to the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re, this would make a good pit stop to rest. The Roman amphitheater is definitely a sight to see in Lyon!",
          "take the funicular in old town to get to the cathedral and ruins. there are actually two theaters but the one in malaga is better.",
          "Well kept ruins of roman amphitheatre. Worth to see when visiting Fourvierre cathedral, is is located some few hundred meters away on the other side of the hill (opposite direction vs city center). Free admition to the ruins and fee for the museum (didn't go as the ratings were",
          "Our research of Lyon had not revealed that there were Roman Theatres to explore. We were pleasantly surprised to find them when we exited the funicular on our way to the top of Fourviere Hill. The Theatre is surprisingly large and the area of the ruins is large.",
          "Interesting and amazing roman theatre woth vivsiting. Stroll around an be astonid by the huge building. Afterwards it is possible to walk down to the old town by a lovely path.",
          "Fascinating and well worth a visit. You can stroll around all over the area. There is also a small museum which is closed on Mondays - we were there on a Monday!",
          "Open to visit without a fee. Only if you want to go to the Museum you have to pay an entrance fee, There is a cable car connection from downtown to the remains. You have to imagine what has happened here in the past times - Today it is just remains, black stones scattered",
          "Just after visiting this place together with museum did I realise how important Lyon was in the times of Romans. Beatiful site definitely worth the walk up.",
          "This area was open so you can walk in and all over them which was interesting. They are the remains of an old Roman amphitheatre. They could maybe have more information explaining what everything is.",
          "This site gives one a real insight into the amazing capabilities of the Romans, their design and architecture are fabulous to find so much still standing after all this time",
          "I\u2019ll start by prefacing I\u2019ve not seen Roman ruins outside of Rome but found them quite interesting. It\u2019s about 300m away from the Cathedral which is worth a visit so would suggest doing both at once. I didn\u2019t go into the museum as it was \u20ac7 and wasn\u2019t that interested but FYI if",
          "Truly amazing these theatres are so well-preserved - built 15th century BC and interesting to compare them with those near Taormina, Sicily or Nimes. Unfortunately we did not have the opportunity to visit the Gallo-Roman Museum of Civilization which was highly recommended to us.",
          "Despite of the decayed appearance of the theater, surprisingly, its architecture is not very different from modern ones. People who enjoyed plays in the period of thousands of years ago may not be different from us either.",
          "Fantastic Roman remains (which are used to date for concerrts etc.) Magnificent remains of not one but two amphitheatres and lots of ancillary building remains. A truly fantastic Roman site, and I have visited many British Roman sites and Rome itself! The semi-circular",
          "Honestly there\u2019s not much to see here. I wouldn\u2019t recommend that you go out of your way to see this\ud83e\udd21. However it is near the church so passing by is easy.",
          "Yet another of the gems of Lyon In Roman times this place could hold upto 20,000 you would not imagine it but the Romans did have a very ingenious streak. A piece of ancient history in this great city. However it is always worth bearing in mind that these places were places of",
          "Although the way up, it is worth to go! A place like this very constructive and well conserved ! We were there for the \"fete des lumieres\" and the transformations from day to night was great!!",
          "A short walk from the bus stop on the city tour these remains are impressive in their size . It wasn\u2019t so busy the day we visited as the weather was very cold . Little by way of tourist facilities nearby !",
          "I loved it, it is better to visit it in a sunny day, so you can stand a while there. when you visit The Fourvier Cathedral, You can visit the ruins too.",
          "The acoustic of this amphitheatre is amazing. You wonder how someone, 2000 years ago, could think of building such a wonderful structure.",
          "Great spot to wander around and enjoy the ruins. Steep walk up worth it. Again the view back over Lyon is lovely from up here. Also a nice spot to just sit and enjoy the setting.",
          "On your way to Basilique Notre Dane de Fourvi\u00e8re, very nice well preserved Roman theatre. Definitely to see",

          "So interesting to see the number of Roman ruins throughout France and interesting to find the amphitheater ruins in Lyon. We have seen a lot of medieval structures in France but to see Roman ruins is a real plus.",
          "The ruins are interesting but typical of Roman theatres. Th setting is great, though, with Lyon stretching out below. The associated museum is quite good, providing a good understanding of the historical development and importance of Lyon. rthiwhiel",
          "It is mind blowing to think that the remains of this structure was built 2000 years ago. It is fascinating to imagine what it looked like when it was complete.",
          "We have seen several historic Roman amphi-theatres across Europe and this one will probably feature in top 3 in our list. This 2,000 years old theatre is in good shape and they even have concerts here. With a capacity to sit 10,000 people, this is one of the bigger theatres",
          "This site can be viewed by foot, on the tourist trolley, or the tourist bus - all go by the site. It' easily accessible, well preserved, and interesting to see.",
          "A really nice spot to visit. It is towards the top of the hill west of Vieux Lyon, so the funicular is the preferred way to the top.",
          "Access by funicular or car parking nearby. Beautiful modern museum with views overlooking the two Roman theatres. The only downer was the pickpocket who took my wallet while walking back to the car. Luckily I discovered it immediately and yelled at the guy so he dropped it and",
          "Amazing collection of roman artifacts plus amphitheatre. Get there from old town via funicular and so great view of Lyon.",
          "The archaeological site is free to enter, and open from something like sunrise to sunset, ideal to do near sunrise when the sun shines on the partially ruined amphitheatre and next to it the smaller Odeon, probably used to oratory and music during Roman times. Both are still in",
          "We found the museum vastly interesting. The museum is large and consists of 5 levels (if I counted correctly) visited on gradually descending ramps. There are unique overhead views of Roman mosaics made possible by voids in the floors. Lyon was an important Roman city where",
          "This review is just about the ruins not the museum that's also there. Loved the ruins. I love old stuff like that. I love imagining all the people through out the centuries experiencing an amazing play. The laughter and tears that have been shared on those steps and on that",
          "Just round the corner from the cathedral. Take the funicular up the hill (is covered under your metro ticket), see the cathedral and city views and wander back to the old city via these. Absolutely fantastic!",
          "There are two Theatres here. One bigger and one small should be Oprea. It help us know more about Lyon.",
          "Close to the Fourviere hotel, these roman amphitheaters are well worth a visit, although the steps are very large and steep, it is a very impressive sight, and with views over the city a bo us. There is also what looks like a very interesting museum. You can walk down through",

          "This was a pleasant surprise while walking up to see the Basilique Notre Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re (I had no idea it was here!). You can enter the grounds and walk around to explore without an admission fee. There is a museum you can enter for more history. This theatre was built in 15",

          "One of the better preserved amphitheaters we have seen in Europe although the one in Turkey is better but I think it was reconstructed where this one is original construction and well maintained. Site is open for walking around so you get the feel of the place. I think it is",
          "just a short stroll down from the Basilica. Free access and well preserved. You can imagine how it might have been like just sitting on the steps . Worth a visit.",
          "Fairly well preserved and still used for concerts. One of several I have seen ,but this was one of the better ones",
          "Amazing to imagine all the works done there by the Roman, long time ago. Nice place to relax and walk. The maintenance of the site is well done. You can visit the museum.",
          "This is one of the best persevered Amphitheater that we have seen considering that you can just walk all over it . It has very steep steps in places so be careful . It is a short walk from the Basilica Norte Dame and has a fabulous museum attached to it . A must see attraction.",
          "We stumbled on these ruins by accident whilst walking up to the cathedral. A beautiful view with a lot of history. They are in very good condition and you can walk through it all. There is also a museum here but I didn't go in so i'm not sure if you have to pay or not.",
          "Any time you have a chance to sit in a Roman amphitheater, take it . Well preserved and expansive. Models in the museum show that both theaters were roofed. Amazing feats of engineering!",
          "Went up to the ruins this evening (24th September 2017). Arrived around 6.10pm (advertised close time of 7.00pm). We were hounded off site so we exited at 6.30pm by an offensive lady who advised her colleague over the radio she wanted to get home early. No idea if this is",
          "The adjacent museum is nice, if a bit too spread out for the size of the collection. Quite honestly, if you've been to Rome, there isn't anything new or unique to see here. However, if you are in Lyon and want to spend an hour or so, then this is a worthwhile activity.",
          "One of my favorites attractions in Lyon. It's open air and there're lots of good angles for photos, and also a museum attached.",
          "A short walk from the Basillica Notre Dame de Fourviere and an even shorter walk from the funicular (Minimes - Th\u00e9\u00e2tres Romains stop), this free attraction is more than worth the price of admission. Located just outside the Mus\u00e9e Gallo-Romain, these two theaters have been",
          "this was very interesting and well worth walking up to and seeing the relics saved and a concert using the facilities is pretty cool",
          "It is hard not to be impressed by the scale of any Roman ruin but this is reduced to the bare brick and despite its location has no view over the city, unlike the theatre at Taormina for example.",
          "Entry is free. Plaques in English and French explain the significance of what you are seeing. The theatres are in a remarkable state of preservation. Performances are still sometimes held here. There are stunning views across Lyon towards the Alps. The funicular (included in",
          "Beautifully looked after an incredible sight to be seen and epic views of the city! a must if u visit Lyon we sat here just looking out over Lyon for a couple of hours in the lovely sunshine.",
          "Next to the wonderful Basilica it is worth a visit and is quite interesting, and again free!.We visited on an extremely hot day, just be warned there is not much shelter from the sun.",
          "This is a pleasant and unexpected part of Lyon getting to see Roman ruins and a well preserved. It requires some level of fitness but is free and a nice way to wonder around the site in the afternoon also giving good views of Lyon.",
          "Two Gallo-roman theatres. Worth a clamber up and down. Good views of Lyon too. Don't miss the museum. Proof how important Lyon was in roman times",
          "Accessible by the fernicular rail and a short walk from the church Saint Jean Baptiste de Lyon so can do both in one visit. Interesting place historically. Of course, not really accessible to wheelchair or buggy users from the top but from below it's ok. Very hot day but it's",
          "Very interesting, apparently the oldest in France. Two Roman theatres a few hundred metres from the Basilica. If you're into your Roman history and fit because there are loads of steps come here then jump on a train and have a look at Nimes in the south.",
          "This ancient amphitheater is apparently still in use. Would love to attend something there. The acoustics are great and it's really a treat to be able to freely roam over a structure that is so ancient.",
          "Enjoy the roman heritage to Lyon in this place. Walk around its steps and sit to imagine how things could hve been at old times",
          "If one just visited the baselique, one can easily quickly visit the theatre. It's ancient and still operating as a theatre. Well maintained.",
          "If you visit Lyon during the Nuits de Fourviere don't deny yourself the experience of a concert in the amphitheater in Lyon. It is a truly magnificent place to experience a concert, and when you sit there it interesting to imagine how people as been entertained there for 2000",
          "These Roman ruins, on the Fourviere Hill are easy to visit as you make your way up to the Fourviere cathedral. They include a (still-functioning) Roman amphitheater that is the highlight. You'll get a strong sense of history from just sitting on the theatre steps looking out at",
          "Highly recommended to visit this Roman museum and open amphitheatre near Fourviere. This is included in the Lyon card as also is public transport and access to a number of attractions. The boat tour on the Rhone River is worthwhile as also is the Old city sightseeing tram in",
          "This is really a place worth to visit. The amphitheater originates from the first century. Unfortunately we had too short time to stay. It is still in use.",
          "We visited these ruins on 20.07.2017 and both amphitheatres had stage and lighting set ups for a concert (or similar). Great venue if you were attending the show, but not so great for visitors that only have two days in town and were interested in the history of Lyon. I imagine",
          "Such a well kept roman amphitheatre which STILL PLAYS LIVE SHOWS! I just wish I had seen one as I can imagine it would have been just awesome! Still great to wander around though!",
          "Thank goodness France looks after it's antiquities. We did not spend enough time here but it was excellent.",
          "Worth stopping by on the way down from Fourviere. Incredibly hot in the summer. They have tango lessons/shows and other events here some nights.",
          "Our first visit to Lyon and we were happy to see such history from the time when it was known as Lugdunum. The ruined theaters were well preserved and obviously still being used for events to this day.",
          "Lyon actually has two, the smaller Odeon and the larger theatre, showing how important it was in Roman times. During the festival which takes place there in June and July entry is free so we were able to explore the ruins although we did not visit the museum. Lyon has a rich",
          "This theater is AWESOME! The history related to this site is mind boggling! We went there for a major free event where a Lyon Opera presentation was broadcasted live on 14 huge screens across the region....one of those screens was installed here. We were 5000 people sitting",
          "Amazing that such an amazing structure has survived since Roman times. A must see...even just to see its survival",
          "Our tour guide took us to the amphitheatre and so glad she did. We talked from the street level to the stage level. If you have a problem with steps this will be difficult as there are no hand rails except on the far left and right and then those steps are extremely steep.",
          "Roman ruins and the vastness of the area. Would like to take in the concert of today and experience the acoustical sounds of the venue.",
          "Beautifully set up museum with incredible displays. The ancient theatre ruins are breathtaking. The museum is well laid out and accommodated all the well behaved and very engaged young school children. The museum and ruins are a must see for anyone visiting Lyon!",
          "This is definitely one of the better preserved Roman ruins. Very interesting to walk around and imagine what it must have been like in Roman times.",
          "My husband and I went to an outdoor play at the Odeon which is a smaller theatre in part of this amazing Roman outdoor theatre complex. The location was just amazing and the event was certainly worthwhile. If you are going for a concert or play, though, it's best to prepare in",
          "Wonderful vestiges of the Roman empire expansion into France, the site is well kept and serves as a setting for many shows during the summer.",
          "There are really two theaters up here, easily reached by a short ride on the funicular. It's an amazing site, particularly in combination with the fantastic Gallo-Romain Museum which is right next to the larger amphitheater. You can walk up to the highest level of this theater",
          "Amazing views and you can revel in the atmosphere of a genuine roman amphitheatre. free to enter superb place for a picnic",
          "Very very nice place. Liked a lot from the beginning. Great for a walk, great for a picnic, great for a nap.... Went there with gf and friends and with the lovely views of the city and the churches, the landscape is just so cool.... Very nice experience",
          "Something everyone visitng Lyon should see. The structure remings me of the Colosium in Rome, but the surroundings are so different.",
          "We visited the Roman Museum and the museum does a great job of telling you of the Roman era in Lyon,there are many displays from statues to dioramas and and flooring.Outside is a Roman Coliseum which we walked to and toured.",
          "Roman ruins of a 2,000 year old structure. The entrance was free - definitely recommended for quick visit.",
          "Well worth a visit - free to wander around the remains of this Roman theatre complex. Museum is right next to it. Great view of the city too.",
          "This place is very impressive and still in pretty decent shape given the age of this \"theater\". The view on Lyon from the seating area us amazing. i would love watching a concert in such a beautiful setting. i did not visit the museum, just walked in the garden area. If you go",
          "The museum was an incredible underground structure & was packed with artefacts. We were expecting just to wander around the ruins but the museum is so much more.",
          "The builder of these ampitheaters had a great sense of location with the sprawling plains behind the stage. It's somewhat isolated position atop Fourviere enable it to survive until the present day.",
          "Go up with finucular and enjoy the best view of lyon city and sen&ren lakes. Lyon is a very lovely city to spend at least three days.",
          "As we were passing we called in for a look as it was free entry. It is a typical ampitheatre fairly well preserved. Set on a hillside it is not good for any one with mobility problems .It appears that it is used for shows etc which must pay for the upkeep.",
          "These ruins aren't far from the basilica at Fourviere... if in the area, it's definitely worth a trip since it's quite quick to visit. Especially nice when concerts are going on...",
          "This huge site dates back over 2000 years but was only rediscovered in the 1950s. The main theatre would have held over 10,000 people and there's a smaller one beside it. The remains have been well excavated and conserved and are now once more used for music and theatre",
          "So close to the Basilica that you cannot miss it. And you should not miss it. Set on the side of the hill that overlooks the city of Lyon there is the beautiful Roman amphitheatre. Very well preserved, very clean. History at Lyon's doorstep. Walking the ruins is relatively",
          "Hubby believes that I forgot to tell him we were going to visit the Roman Amphitheatre, although I am sure I did tell him. Anyways, his reaction as a result of his lack of prior knowledge probably speaks to how amazing the actual site is, I believe his actual words were \"J**** -",
          "Extremely well curated and informative museum (Roman Gallo Mus\u00e9e), about Lugdunum, which was the center of the Roman Empire in Gaul. I got the audio guide, but it wasn't really necessary as the English translations on the signage were excellent. One of the standouts for me were",
          "Very well restored/preserved ruins and the museum - using an audio guide - is great. Take funicular to get to the top.",
          "Impressive structure. Hard to believe so much of it has been kept intact. Took the funicular via Vieux-Lyons metro station. Worth taking the time to visit.",
          "These are roman ruins in France . If one hasn't been to Italy or seen roman ruins before then it might be slightly interesting otherwise no point going there .",
          "This Roman Theatre located just off the main road up to the Notre-Dame church up the Feurviere. Our tour guide just mentioned briefly and our bus just slowed down and never stopped. Compares to other Roman historical site around the Lyon area, this is very low quality.",
          "Excellent sight to visit. Very interesting and well renovated. Museum also worth spending time in. A worth stop on the way to the Basilique de Notre Dame",
          "This is the site of the original Roman settlement and subsequent development. Forum, amphitheatre and general spacing is well laid out and preserved. Museum is also excellent. I spent a couple of very relaxing hours wandering around. Would be great for a picnic of a sunny day. A",
          "Even if you take the funicular there is still a steep walk to the site but it's well worth it. The site has free entry (entry into the museum costs a few euros) and you can wander round the two amphitheatres to your heart's content.",
          "The Romans were extraordinary builders and these two theatres are a good example of this. The larger one was designed to seat 11,000 people and the smaller one was designed to seat around 3,000 and it's possible to sit where those Romans sat so long ago. In fact, concerts are",
          "Up the hill above old town Lyon are the two Roman Theatre remains which have been restored in part to be currently functional. The view from the site overlooking the city is also good. What we were not told about was the companion museum that is on the street to the right of",
          "Wonderfull to see, very quiet, impressive! Very well preserved history from the Roman times. A must to see!",
          "A very good archeological site. Don't miss it if you go to Lyon. Be ready to walk up to the hill and wear sneakers.",
          "Really interesting place to visit, so close to the centre of the town. Really impressive and there is nice view also from the top. The theatre is in a really good condition. It would be interesting to hear something performed there.",
          "I wonder how much of the original thatres are left. You see a modern day version of them. Fun nevertheless.",
          "This is one of the most complete Roman theatres we\u2019ve seen anywhere, and is very impressive. Unusually, there are two theatres \u2013 one large, one (the odeon) small \u2013 adjacent to each other. At capacity, they could accommodate around 11,000 spectators in total. They\u2019re in",
          "This is a great trip to include if you have only a day and you can combine it with your visit to the Basilque Notre-Dame Fourvire. Theatre Romains can be accessed via the Vieux -Lyons metro station that is in the vicinity of St Jean cathedral. If you using public transport buy",
          "Benefitting from the stones here, the Romans built 2 huge theatres. Found by coincidence in the 1940's only, now used for festivals in the summer. Great way to go up by funiculaire.",
          "The fairly extensive remains of the old Roman theatre in Lyon are worth a hike. Would be nice to see a performance there, which does happen (check).",
          "If you have a marble theatre in mind, it is not the case, but it is a beautiful place for a stroll, a quiet book -readying spot, relaxing lying & you will definitely combine it with a visit in the Gallo-Roman museum.",
          "Walk for my Downtown hotel up to the ruins it was magnificent to see although the day we went the museum shop is closed but you could walk around and read the placards absolutely must see",
          "This is the remains of a Romanesque coliseum of which portions are still in use today. Simply fascinating to climb on these walls which have been in use for hundreds of years.",
          "Very impressive pair of Roman theatres that are still remarkably intact. Well worth a visit, in conjunction with Fourviere.",
          "It was a wonderful place that you can see the views and ancient theatres. If it's sunny it can be really nice to have lunch there or take a rest.",
          "With 2 theatres, a smaller and the large one, you feel drawn back to the past. All with a great view over Lyon",
          "The theatre is still in very good condition. You can just sit here, relax and enjoy the panoramic view of Lyon while learning history. The best thing is it's free. We have visited numerous roman theatres and majority of them are not free.",
          "Right outside the Gallo Roman Museum, you shouldn't see one without the other! Enjoy a grassy climb through the area or take the stairs :-)",
          "I loved this as the museum. I habe never been anywhere like this although always wanted to. The museum was free entry on the day we went (Sunday). Some of the exhibits really took my breath away as they are so old yet lasted so long. It really makes you think about how much",
          "This is an amazing, well maintained area of Roman ruins from early AD years. Of all the architecture in the Lyon area, this is the best. I wish I could be here for concerts as I understand the acoustics and experience are wonderful.",
          "This outdoor theater is really worth seeing, I would love to go to a concert there. I is still a working theatre",
          "They got around the Romans...pretty much where ever you go in France there are ties to Roman occupation and or influence. The hold concerts here - I would love to be here to experience music in the old theatre.",
          "Located really close to the cathedral. A really nice and quite place just to sit and enjoy the time.",
          "If you happen to be in Lyon, in the south of France, this is another must see place, dating back to the time Lyon was Lugdunum the capital of the Gauls. It is rather easy to find, at the very foot of the Fourvi\u00e8re hill, there are road signs everywhere to show you the way. At the",
          "This Roman Theatre must have been restored quite a bit. That is good, since it is usable now again - but it makes it a wee bit boring. Worth going for a look in case you pass by, but not necessary to travel across the city for it.",
          "Modern museum with a very good layout and loads to see. The amphitheatres themselves are stunning and it is great value.",
          "it was an enjoyable walk through the well maintained, preserved ampitheatre. very close to the basilica fourviere.",
          "Take the funicular to see the basilica, and then walk across to here. Entry is free. Well worth a visit and to walk on paths on which the Roams walked 2000 years ago.",
          "How amazing to have a Roman amphitheatre of this quality still there for all to see and enjoy! Very steep climb up the hill to see it but so worth it. Forget driving \u2013 the roads are packed",
          "OK, maybe not the entire day, but darn close to it had we packed water, wine and food. Just a short walk southwest and downhill from the funicular that takes you to the Basilique Notre Dame de Fourviere and well worth it. Many photo ops. Lots of places to sit and enjoy the sun,",
          "This place blew me away, it was much larger than I thought it would be. The place was well taking care of and was enjoyable. If you are going to the Basilique (the one close-by) then don't miss out on this; even if you have to walk a few 100 meters! Pro tip; read a little",
          "This is well preserved and standing in the theatre just thinking of the age of the place and the technology it would have taken to build this place gives a great perspective of the romans and their forward thinking. The museum is definitely worth a visit too, they have an",
          "If you are in the area, do visit this place, must be very nice in summer time. I believe they have concerts , it is open air, walking distance from the church on the hill.",

          "A must see in Lyon and easy to get to from Vieux lyon via the funicular. Continue up the hill to the Basilica Fourviere for spectacular views over Lyon.",
          "Very well conservated ruins! The place invites you to walk around the Arena and to imagine old, old times of theatre , art and probably fights...",
          "This is an ancient Roman amphitheater that has been stabilized and preserved for current theatrical events and concerts. Particularly interesting are the water channels and Roman Columns. You can climb the steps and imagine sitting here from 100 BC to around 300 AD with this",
          "Lovely walk up the Fourviere hill on a sunny day or take the funicular up to the hill top to view this marvellously well preserved amphitheater. Do visit the antiquities museum when there to learn much about the beginnings of Lyon and the Roman settlements in this region.",
          "Check out in the museum the representation of what was here! 2 theatres and surround buildings built 2000 years ago. They still hold concerts here",
          "While visiting Lyon we took the funicular up to the theatre to have a look around. It was a beautiful, clear winter day and it was really neat to have a walk around the ruins of the two theatres that overlook Lyon. First off I would definitely recommend the funicular ride up",
          "I visited this place after had been to the basilica. It was a winter day, so the \"stage\" was full of ice, very dangerous but cool. The stairs, where ancient people might sat, is a litle bit high.",
          "During the Festival of Lights, I visit this wonderful anphitheatre that it is just five mins walk from the Basilique de Notre Dame. Unfortunately the day of my visit in Lon,on December, was quite cold but I am sure that during spring and summer it will be wonderful to walk in",
          "Just below the Basillica, and easy to get to by bus, funicular or on the Lyon hop-on-hop-off bus. The ruins are still used for concerts - you can only image what they would have been in Roman times. I suggest starting at the top just near the rear of the Basillica, and walking",
          "A magnificent Roman empire's piece of architecture and engineering, perfectly preserved and maintained. There's a museum as well that has a great display of pieces from the era, including magnificent large mosaics. Entrance fee for the museum was just a bit over 8 euros for a",
          "You can catch the vernacular up to the top from the same area as the basilica. It's well preserved and there is a cheap Museum attached which is interesting and cheap. It was 2.50 euro entry",
          "We go every few months when friends come to visit. Next to the Basilic, easy parking. Great architectural interest and great for the kid to run around in.",
          "We were there during the light festival in December. Beautiful display and candle ceremony. Must visit during the festival!",
          "I took the funicular from Old Lyon (Vieux Lyon) up to the Roman Theatre and walked back down the 14% slope to View Lyon. The Roman Theatre dates from 43 BC and still remains pretty spectacular. It makes for a fun, interesting visit. Great for photos and for people watching.",
          "This is probably one of the best amphitheatres I have been to outside of Rome. The best thing is its actually still in use today to host concerts and events. Its amazing walking round it, picturing what it would have been like. The amphitheatre is just a short walk from the",
          "Incredibly well preserved Roman amphitheater that was able to seat 10,000 people. Still in use today for concerts it can seat 3000. Admission to the amphitheater is free and you may wander around and explore as you like. The floor in the Odeon is made of marble from all over",
          "It is amazing how after around 2.000 yours we can see live such places. Only to think that it maged to last for so long, it is impressive. The place is being kept in very good conditions and it is really worth seeing.",
          "Who would have thought the Romans built not one amphitheatre here, but two. They are very well preserved and you can clamber over most of the site. You can even recreate scenes from Monty Python should you wish - What did the Romans ever do for us?",
          "I'm not sure what other folks thought they were going to see that didn't give these 5 out of 5. How often in your life do you get to climb around on, not one, but TWO Roman amphitheaters from the time of Christ?!?!? I found them to be fascinating and well worth the time to",
          "We took the funicular up the mountain , visited the Basilique and walked down to the awesome Roman ruins of the amphitheatre.Well preserved ruins that sit on a hillside overlooking the city. But do beware if you are afraid of heights ,as there are steep steps to go down to the",
          "These amphitheaters are well worth a visit and the views of Lyon are spectacular. We got the funicular railway from Vieux Lyon as the walk is incredibly steep, visited the amphitheaters, walked the short distance up to the cathedral and then down the path (steep!) to the bottom",
          "We've seen a lot of Roman ruins, but with this one, there's a real sense of immense scale. And since it's still being used, you can see where people sit, how they get in, the stage, etc. all adds to being able to truly comprehend. We walked up from the old city, a hike, but",

          "We caught the funicular uphill to visit these ruins but it is just as easy to walk down from the Basilica at the top of the Fourviere hill. I found the ruins to be quite large and impressive but it would have been helpful to have had a bit more information available. it is free",

          "We took the funicular up the mountain to see these ruins. Apparently there is also a walking trail up but it takes hours. The ruins are wonderful to see and I found it very interesting to see examples of the drainage system. There are many stairs to climb so wear good shoes.",
          "What an amazing site. Roman ruins on the hill of Fourvi\u00e8re, located just a short funicular ride up from Vieux Lyon. The structures themselves are in amazing condition considering they were built about 2000 years ago. Combine the historical value of the site with the",
          "The theatre and amphitheatre have both been restored to the point that they can be used for events. They give an excellent sense of Roman architecture. As an additional bonus, they have a wonderful view over the city. You must see these and the Gallo-Roman Museum near by.",
          "Would love to see a concert in this place! Difficult to believe that this was only uncovered in the 1930's. And only a very short walk from the funicular & the basilica.",

          "The funicular makes the way to the top easy. Stroll down from the basilica and take in the Roman museum, as well. The ruins of the theater offer great views of the city, and the amazing feel of history.",
          "The ruins of the theatre are beautiful and totally free to visit, sit around on them and contemplate the beautiful day and/or what life was like back then. We spent some time walking, sitting and walking some more. It was a nice experience. Although we did not visit the",

          "This Roman amphitheatre is massive, I would definitely recommend a visit. There are loads of places to sit down and have a rest when you've walked up to the top and the views of the city are stunning. You could probably take a picnic here if you wanted. There seemed to be quite",
          "Walk down from Basilica, free and open entrance, and enjoy imagining what it was like. Talk or sing from the bottom and you will hear the tremendous acoustics. A misnomer, we learnt, to call it amphitheaters as this would require the ellipse like in the Coliseum in Rome, so",
          "The Roman Amphitheatres on Fourviere Hill are well-preserved monuments to ancient Rome in France. Sitting on the seats (stone steps) of the amphitheatres also has the backdrop views of Lyon. A great visit!",
          "As we walked from the Basilica, we stopped to visit the Roman ampitheatre. You can't helped but be impressed by the Romans. It was a hot day when we visited so we just found some shade and just looked at it imagining what it must have been like when in use by the Romans.",
          "Beautiful day, amazing view, fresh air, peaceful and a massive church. What's not to like? Perhaps the MASSIVE spider that came running towards me, but thats just me, someone else might enjoy it. Definitely pay a visit, grab a coffee and a muffin enjoy the view.",
          "We took the tram up the mountain. We viewed the cathedral then walked over to here. The ruins were fun to see. We then took the stairs all the way down (you can also take the tram down). Glad we visited the site.",
          "Not as impressive as other sites in Italy but still worth a wonder and visit if you like history. Has some nice views of the city",
          "Had an enjoyable afternoon visiting this historical place. We also went into the museum and that was really worth the small amount we paid for the ticket!",
          "Coming from the UK where we're lucky if our Roman ruins get over a metre high and date from anything earlier than 2nd century AD (!)it is seriously exciting to see such extensive and early remains. But the signs are few,the museum does not sell a guidebook and though there's an",
          "We got the funicular up to St Just and walked over to the Theatres which are free to enter. They are well preserved and have great views over Lyon. The walk back down to vieux Lyon is lovely too.",
          "It's not just Ruins It's history and it's monumental in a very good shape one of the most impressive and beautiful roman theater with the close Vienne one On Fourviere Hill , The praying hill in Lyon with also a small theater a gallo roman museum and an awesome view of Lyon",
          "Lyon continues to amaze me with its preservation of history. The Roman amphitheater is no exception and a must-see. They also host several performances throughout the summer, something that I'd love to catch on my next visit.",
          "A fascinating sidetrip up the steep roads of Vieux Lyon, worth the hike. Visitors are allowed to walk around the ruins and experience it from all viewpoints. Much of the city of Lyon is visible from the ruins.",
          "This area really shows how important Lugdunum (Lyon) was in Roman times: restoration has been reasonable, giving an idea of the size without attempting to recreate everything. The performances there must be memorable.",
          "For just a few euros you can walk round the fascinating museum, the building itself is worth a look inside. Then outside you can walk round the old theatre remains - or have a picnic as we did!",
          "We really enjoyed an hour or so wandering the Roman ruins on Fourvi\u00e8re Hill. The ruins themselves are free to enter but if you'd like to visit the museum this will cost 10e each. A great place to explore on a sunny day and a great walk from the old town. If you're not keen on",
          "We stopped here as part of hop on hop off bus. Spent around 30 minutes exploring and taking photos then walked up to the Basilica. Great site and wonderful that it is free. There is a Gallo museum but we didn't stop in. You can spend as little or as much time here as you like",
          "This is a large Roman site, well excavated and preserved. Great views over the city. Free entrance. Not particularly good if you have mobility problems - I am waiting on a knee replacement so couldn't do the whole site",
          "A very large and a much smaller amphitheater right next to the Basilica. These will require a steep walk either up or down. Use the funicular to get up the hill.",
          "I did not know that the Romans were the previous residents of Lyon! Their history has been well preserved both in a museum near the amphitheater and what is left of the structures. Easy walking to all corners of the ruins. Bring your camera!",
          "Walk around the ruins of the houses and streets and the amphitheatres which are now used for concerts. The Roman Gallo Museum is a must, the mosaics are just fabulous. Very clever people these Romans.",
          "The amphitheater is next to the Musee Gallo Romans, a collection of artifacts and tombstones from the Roman era. This is a must for any history or archaeology aficionados .",
          "Easy to get to and very interesting outside at the ruins and inside the museum. Audio guide was free and added to the museum exhibits.",
          "The attached museum would make this a great outing on a rainy day. Take the Funicular up and walk down via the Cathedral on a good day.",
          "We found the theater by accident when walking up toward the basilica, and walked around for a while. It's very pretty, with a stunning view of the city!",
          "Very good to explore this area. So much history. Up the hill so need to be good at walking or take a taxi there.",
          "This is a most interesting attraction with 2theatres, a forum and many inscribed funerary stones. There are excellent views over the city.",
          "It's a great theater, the accustic it's amazing. We could almost image how it should be 2 thousand years ago.",
          "Fantastic place free to roam around well preserved and maintained there is also a small amphitheatre on site",
          "A must see, go early we had the place to ourselves. The theatres are in pretty good condition and impressive",
          "I liked this view very much. It's nice and silent here which is ideal for a picnic. Also try to visit the cathedral once you are there",
          "Impressive. Came here with my 10 year old. This is a great place to ponder authenticity and site usage if you are a heritage enthusiast. We thought is was neat to find the mosaic and think about what all the rooms were used for.",
          "Well preserved roman ruins but used for modern concerts in an excellent setting. They were rehearsing for a play in the nearby park which was most interesting to see",
          "Walked to here from the basilica....worth the short walk and the climb down the steps to soak up the atmosphere of the theatre. Some information boards would make it better.",
          "These 2 amfitheatres are in good state of conservation. They usually do some music festivals in summer. Take the funiculaire to go to Fourviere and then walk <5min to get there.",
          "The place is really nice, but i will be better if there is tour guide for this place or you can drop by the musem. The musem entry is free only on Jeudi if i not mistaken",
          "Such a well preserved UNESCO protected part of Lyon's Roman history, much dating back to the 3rd century AD. It was good to see the place being used for outdoor concerts- enabling people to incorporate history into the present. Free admission and one of the best Roman roads I",
          "You can reach the site either on foot from the Fourviere Basilica or via the San Just Funicular alighting at Minimes but ion July it was a complete waste of time trekking up here in the heat! However from a tourist perspective wanting to appreciate a significant Roman site and",
          "The Roman theatres are certainly an impressive sight in an amazing location but there were a couple of aspects that we found disappointing - a general lack of signage and information so that we did not really know what we were looking at and the story behind it - the modern",
          "If you're into ancient sites then this is a priority in Lyon. The ruins are pretty good and you get a wonderful view from up the top. The museum that is next to the site is very good and has some great exhibits - well worth a visit.",
          "Amazing example of Roman life. The thought of the reach of the Roman Empire, the buildings, the commerce and the recreation of some 2000 plus years ago is boggling. Fascinating piece of history.",
          "Great environment... Though the fact that the amount of lightning during the concert did not cause the show to stop was concerning.",
          "We saw the Roman theatres after visiting the Gallo-Roman Museum which is close by. There is no cost to wander around the 2 theatres, and was interesting to speculate how they built these at the top of Fourviere Hill.",
          "Was surreal but magical. Not sure why a band was playing but maybe doing a sound check for an evening concert. Bring some water and a baguette and enjoy this special place.",
          "Sadly we didn't get to explore it all due to the summer concert set up, What we saw was well maintained. Would have enjoyed more signage around explaining what we were looking at. Kids enjoyed climbing over the ruins and trying out the smaller amphitheatre acoustics.",
          "I loved Lyon and the Roman ruins and museum. The museum was particularly interesting ( loved the statue of Neptune pulled from the river and also the mosaics). No, this isn't the forum in Rome ( which I was fortunate to finally visit in January), but if you're in the fantastic",
          "Wonderful restoration of ancient theater. The adjacent museum tells the story of ancient Lyon from the times of the Gaul through occupation by the Romans with many artifacts from these periods. Definitely worth the effort.",
          "Interesting Roman theaters ruins. Although not to impressive (maybe due to the fact that I'm coming from an ancient Roman city?). Still worth a visit.",
          "Like many of these places, of course nice to have a look back in history. But the history is disturbed by the scenes being built for the shows that are taking place. If you want to see Roman history there are much better places - E.g. In the North of England.",
          "We were astounded by the size and excellent condition of this amphitheater. As we walked around there was a group of musicians warming up for a concert that evening. I'm sure it is a great spot to hear music.",
          "Excellent historical site of Gallo-Roman, also a place for some events like concerts, exhibits and other phenomenal performances, well kept and nice area to roam around.",
          "This would be a great place to see a band or play - all of the seats have a good view and interesting to see it still being used after 2000 years for the same thing! Take the funicular up and walk back down.",
          "Be sure to include a trip through the museum on a visit to the Roman ruins in Lyon. The museum is well laid out, descriptions in English as well as French and at the end you can walk right out to the ruins, which you will understand much better after the Museum.",
          "Was here last year. Little hard to find but worth of looking. Museum is also great place to learn something about roman history of this area.",
          "Museum and restored ruins of Gallo-Roman era in Lyon. An excellent archeological and historical site with many exhibits, explanations, and even the chance to see artistic performances in the the restored amphitheaters.",
          "Saw this area on the way up to the Basilique Notre Dame de Fourviere. Interesting area to view how the Romans lived during their time in this city.",
          "If you have taken the funicular to Notre Dame Fourviere then just a little way down the hill lie these so well preserved Roman ruins. Unfortunately at the time we were there they were being used for concerts and so we had limited access. Nevertheless it was well worth the trip",
          "We arrived via the tram and we're greatly surprised by the Roman theatres. The architecture and quality that they are kept in is excellent. We walking all the way from top to bottom and enjoyed thinking ab poo ut what they looked like in the Roman days. It's a good workout on",
          "The theaters (outdoors) themselves are interesting, but the museum, quietly hidden into the hillside in at least 4 levels, offers an in in-depth history of Lyon from the Roman era, including English translations, with tons of large artifacts. It was definitely worth more time",
          "Took the funicular arrives just outside the site. Entry is free of charge. Amphitheatre has been adapted as a live venue for music concerts and you could stumble in on a sound check of a famous band. The site is very open so be aware of the heat.",
          "As far as ruins go, this one is a typical Roman artifact. It is free to enter, but if they have a concert planned for the evening, they will close the entrances around 6 pm. We did not go to any performances, but it was a nice place to visit. Our kids enjoyed climbing the ruins.",
          "There is a certain feeling you get whilst wandering around centuries old Roman ruins. I love it. The view of the city is spectacular and I imagine the concerts, etc held there are fantastic. If you are heading up to the cathedral anyway, this is definitely worth a stop. I",
          "I'm a big fan of Roman history, and these ruins were wonderful in that regard. They're very well preserved, free to visit, and set in picturesque garden settings with a view of the city. Alongside exploring them, we spent time just sitting in the amphitheater enjoying the",
          "What do you do with an thousands year old Theatre? Use it as a theatre of course. Fascinating, a way to help finance restoration and preservation, while providing an amazing theatre experience. Worth the stop",
          "It's a beautiful spot to see some of Lyon's roman heritage. You can see why they have chosen it as the setting for the summer music festival I imagine seeing a performance here would be quite special. Also access to the theatres is free so if you don't have time to go round the",
          "As always in France access was well planned. A furnicular railway free to use with a metro ticket. Unmarked toilet (singular as only the disabled cubicle was unlocked, hence a long slow queue) was a low point. Amazing location, no explabation on site. Two badly scratched",
          "2,000 years old and still in use! Now that's built to last. Easy to find and walk around. Combine with a trip to the Basilica makes for a great afternoon.",
          "The Roman Amphitheater remains are a must see when in Lyon especially if you are visiting the Basillica at Fourviere. Great example of planning and stonework which has stood the test of time. Used for concerts and light shows etc.",
          "We ventured up by furniculare to the Basilica and walked down to the ruins. Nothing compared to other Romance ruins, but a great view of Lyon and a really amazing place to see a concert. We only saw a sound check and it sounded great in the arena and all the way up to the",
          "Well preserved and great for children to explore. If you like walking you will enjoy it. They were setting up for a concert when we visited so ir was fun watching the sound checks ETC.",
          "Really vast expanse of Roman ruins, very interesting and with beautiful views of the surrounding area during the summer months. Lovely place for a walk, to explore the history, and to sit and chill.",
          "I believe Lyon was the capital city of Roman Gaul hence the wonderful amphitheatre. I think it is great that it's used for pop concerts. Romans borrowed and followed all sorts of stuff from earlier civilisations.To wander amongst such history is marvellous.",
          "Looking at ruins without any guidance or information is just simply looking at a pile of rocks...... Wouldn't bother ....",
          "It is so much more than that of course. The history and fairly well intact amphitheatre is one of Lyon's highlights. The fact that you have free reign to climb on and amongst what remains brings you closer to the past. The scale of the construction and width of intact walls is",
          "Was pleasantly surprised at the Roman ruins and museum pieces. Check out the bronze statues and swords - lots of amazing mosaics and Roman writings. Best Easter Eggs - Celtic calendar and the bronze tablet of Claudius' plea to the Imperial Senate to let the Gallic provinces",
          "Not the highlight of the trip but still worth some time to visit. One can imagine the plays there used to be performed in ancient times.",
          "A must see item on your Lyon itinerary. One of the finest roman sites I have visited and still in use for entertainment today. Breathtaking.",
          "The place has a stunning view of Lyon, and you can climb around on the ruins while imagining the rock concerts of 2,000 years ago.",
          "The two Roman ampitheatres are stunning, and it is interesting how they are open to the public as part of a park and used for live summer performances. A stone's throw from the Fourvi\u00e8re basilica. Bit of a hike up the hill, but there is always the funicular (part of the city",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to the Gallo-Roman Theatres - liked how they have been repurposed as a modern concert venue. Good photo opportunities.",
          "Was only a whistle stop trip to be fair so can't really form too much of an opinion. Looked decent enough",
          "Fascinating site which we walked by on our way to Fourviere. It was raining so did not want to stop to fully explore but definitely looked to be well worth a trip at a later time.",
          "I liked this little museum both for its displays and for its architecture. If you have mobility issues, it is comfortable because there are ramps. Start at the top which is the earliest historically, and don't miss the light show/topographical model, which though in French, is",
          "The theatre is quite interesting if you're a fan of Roman ruins however it is still a functioning theatre so they have installed some modern features so the site has been spoilt a bit in my opinion however going up Fourviere Hill and visiting the Basilica is a must so when",
          "It's a 30 min hard walk up the hill, but worth it. Location is wonderful and ruins interesting as always. Worth to check also bacilica next to this place",
          "Both the large and small amphitheatres are impressive and both are used for events - suggest you check they are open to public before making a special trip. The associated museum is free entry. Great views, families were picnicing, great idea. Nice to sit and reflect.",
          "The gates close early when there is a concert in the theatre so be careful if leaving the grounds and want to walk back through. Nice visit free entrance.",
          "As a history nut I couldn't visit Lyon without seeing these remains - I can honestly say these are well worth the climb to see mostly complete Roman theatres is a brilliant treat if you are at all interested in history make these a priority while in Lyon.",
          "The remains are pretty unimpressive visually themselves but are a must so close to the basilica AND you must see the museum. We almost walked past the museum thinking it was a modern theatre. The preparation for a performance and the modern stage spoilt the attraction for us",
          "The Roman amphitheater was a surprise find for us after we walked up the hill from old Lyon to visit the basilica and explore the area. It was a glorious afternoon to sit in the sunshine up on the hill amongst the grass and the ruins and be taken back it's heyday.",
          "If you enjoy the old stones you can have a stop here during your site tour in our city. The place is \"rare\" with a beautifull view on Lyon city. But you can also plan to reserve places for a concert event. Don't forget a cushion for your back or the old stone will remind you!",
          "This was very cool, it's free to walk around and it's right around the corner from Basilique Norte Dame Fourviere. I like that it is still being used for concerts today. The museum was alright. Make sure to do this and the church n the same day.",
          "I'm kind of a sucker for Roman ruins, but it was great fun to clamber all over these. Good view of the city, and the museum really is stunning.",
          "During my first visit in Lyon in 2014, I discovered the Theares Romains de Fourviere quite by accident. I was on a business trip and had been through a stressful morning but decided to visit Fourviere in the afternoon after the morning's tasks were completed. Took the funicular",
          "A place up hill where you can have bird eye view of the city. Easy to go just by metro. It would be better if there is no other event stage preparation which block overall scene.",
          "A must to see for anyone visiting Lyon. A wonderful ride up the hill with the funicular with a great view. The theater itself is impressive and takes one back in time. The staff were friendly and even spoke English which was a great help.",
          "It's a great bit of history and kids absolutely love it! Take a picnic and a box of plasters and let them climb and explore everything!",
          "History comes alive here, particularly for people like myself, who are history lovers. Just could not get enough. You go up the steep hill either by walking up, which is quite a fitness exercise and very tiring for those who find such things hard to manage. Or you take the easy",
          "This can be reached by the furnicular railway. There is a large and a small amphitheater and there is a viewing area above to give a good view of all the ruins. Located near the basilica and the Fourvieres all three sites can be visited in one trip. Better to go mid week to",
          "This Roman theater is just 500 meters away from the funicular exit. It is a beautiful site well preserved worth to visit, especially if you like history. It is always impressive to see what our ancestors built last so long.",
          "Unfortunately they were setting up for the Summer Festival when we were there which kind of ruined it for us. However, I can imagine seeing your favourite artist there would be so exhilarating, and the line up looked fantastic. Bit of a shame for us though.",
          "These can be reached by the little funicular railway which you take from the bottom of the hill. There are two large Roman arenas , the larger of which is used for jazz concerts etc. If only Hyde Park had one!",
          "We walked around and through the remains of this awesome Roman theatre - there are actually two theatres! The restoration and maintenance work on these ruins has been carried out with care and a light hand. It is pleasing to see that they are used for the modern performance -",
          "I have to start by admitting that regretfully I didn't visit the next door museum of Roman Lyon and no doubt I should have done so to maximise my return from this visit. However an hour within the archaeological ruins brought its rewards. This is not the best Roman site I",
          "Lyon was the government and commerce center for the 3 Gauls, and was occupied for hundreds of years. This modern museum is built on the site of a Roman amphitheater and arena, on the hill of Fourviere. The museum itself had hundreds of uncovered Roman artifacts, arranged on 4",
          "Such a cool place! The ruins are really neat. The museum next door does an amazing job of really giving you an idea of what Lyon was like in the past. They also give good info and have a model on what the amphitheatre looked like back in gallo-roman times. The coolest thing to",
          "Let your imagination go wild - Roman centurions and all. Didn't get to see the museum - closed on Mondays.",
          "Interesting way to spend a few hours. The museum is very good and surprisingly big to walk around so allow some time. Ruins are very good and its easy to imagine them in the past",
          "Return within an hour and it costs only \u20ac2.80. Recommend you take the Fourviere line to the Basilica, check out the views and fine cathedral then walk over the Roman theatre ruins and return down the St Just line from Minimes station back to old town. Recommended.",
          "It was really romantic. A breath taking view. It's free to come here you just pay for the trains as usual. You can walk though. You can come by bike. So many ways to get there. There is a magnificent view of the whole of Lyon similar to what you get at the church! It's",
          "These Roman amphitheatres are set in the side of the Fouviere hillside below the church. There are two and the site is free and easy to access although decent footwear is required. Not sure about accessibility for those with disabilities though. It was being set-up for a concert",
          "Situated on the hill below the Basilica this Roman site was discovered and can now be visited. Gives an insight into Roman life, the theatre is great and still holds concerts today. We should not be too critical of the modern bands that perform here, after all the income helps",
          "We simply walked through this Roman theater while going down the mountain from the Cathedral on top of the city towards the river. We were told this was originally covered up and hidden, but during some construction in the mid 1900s, this amazing 2000 year old theater was",
          "Would be a great place to see a concert even today which it has been retrofit for. Quick trip to walk through the ruins and envision what it may have been like. Wear comfortable shoes - lots of large cobblestones and stairs.",
          "We had no idea of the emense size of the theatre and were blown away when we arrive there. The easiest way to get the to Theatre is to take the funicular all the way to the top and then come back down after seeing the Basilica. Unfortunately the Theatres museum was closed for a",
          "The 2 arenas have been nicely restored and are easily accessible from Fourviere via the funicular. We were disappointed since they had constructed a significant amount of metal stages, ramps, platforms and light stancions throughout the arena for purposes of concerts and",
          "This is right now the street from the main church Notre dame and about a 5 minute walk down the hill. If you are in the area i would recommend going. It is kind of small but worth it.",
          "It consists in two parts : an amphitheater and an odeon where concerts are held in the summer. I visited ages ago with a HongKong girl who asked me when it had been bombed. Well, no bombing but the Romans left remarkable ruins in Lyon.",
          "These Roman amphitheatres set in the side of the Fouviere hillside below the church. There are two and the site is free and easy to access. There is a funicular railway that is just below the remains. However I would take the other funicular to the top. Visit the church and see",
          "We took the Funicular to this spot on a bright Sunday morning. The amphi theatres are well preserved and the local council were setting up some rigging for a big concert when we arrived...what an impressive location. We also went to the museum next door, which was rammed full of",
          "The Roman theatre remains of Fourviere were extremely interesting. I was amazed at how they had survived for so many years and were in such good condition. Well worth a visit.",
          "Interesting Roman ruins set amongst a pleasant green park area. Great to walk around after a visit via the funicular to the church and miniature Eiffel Tower",
          "A freebie on the hillside accessible by the funicular railway which is part of the metro system - no extra transport fees either! Kids wil love being able to run up and over these ruins, through the old drains etc. Potential for views towards the mountains though low",
          "Well preserved and great to walk around. Near the cathedral and easy to get to on the funicular. Well worth a visit whilst in the old town",
          "If you only go for the architecture, you'll already be in for a treat. Good lesson in the early history of the area and Gaul. Mosaics, ceramics, stonework from both the site and the area. The amphitheater also provides a great view of Lyon. If you walk there, make sure you go",
          "This is reached via the furnicular railway that runs from the old part of Lyon. It was raining when we visited and also, part of it was roped off due to filming or a performance had taken place. There was no entry fee but I'm not sure this is always the case. There are good",
          "They have concerts and many events there. Just sitting on the steps and soaking in the sun felt like going back in time. Well worth going up all those steps but if you don't want to you can just explore the lower level.",
          "Very interesting to see this old theater, open freely for every one. It only 400 meters away from the cathedral , so when you finish the visit to cathedral, just walk opposite direction away from the iron tower. In few minutes, you find the theater",
          "This place is great to visit on the way to the basilica at the top of the hill. 20 minutes is all you really need to walk around and soak up the history. We had a local guide to give us the history.",
          "Go in the morning to avoid crowds. During good weather, it's a nice place for a picnic. Many steps to climb - providing a good work out and at the same time appreciate the historical site.",
          "Not as amazing as I thought it would be, but still interesting. Being so high up gives you an amazing view of Lyon. If you go to the Basilica, then absolutely stop and visit. It's history in the real and very cool. We didn't do the museum, but we should have!",
          "Can people say that this is uninteresting because it looks like other Roman amphitheater ruins? Like saying \"if you seen one Redwood tree, you have seen them all\". Magnificent theaters, completely accessible, no entrance fee, still used for summer concerts....Congrats, Lyon.",
          "Nice museum and Roman amphitheater. If you like Roman history it was worth the time and the five euros a piece to enter. You do not have to pay to enter the amphitheater only the museum.",
          "We preserved and used Roman ruins Wonderful to walk around them and imagine what it was like to live here 2000 years ago. Great signs and interpretation of ruins",
          "The theatres are not like the roman colliseum or other roman ruins we have seen. These still have some of the old foundation but have been renewed for modern concerts. They are interesting but not worth the trip by them selves. We would love to attend a concert there though!",
          "These Roman theatre ruins all look the same. Don't know how someone could spend 20 minutes here. Ever been to the Roman theatre in Tamorina - same thing. Admission fee. If you are going here see the church first and walk down and through the ruins to the tram.",

          "If you are into Roman ruins, this is a lovely spot to wander through. Up high over Lyon, superb views, and a peaceful place. Concerts are held in the amphitheatres. Well worth the climb, or use the Fourviere and walk back down, which is what I did.",
          "My wife and I are blessed to have visited practically all of the world's major Roman ruins in and out of Italy. This one is interesting but not spectacular - except for its location - so high above Lyon. Also well restored so concerts happen here frequently. Imagine a smaller,",

It looks like the larger one is still used for performances on some occasions, so there is some modern lighting sets in between the viewing steps. Must visit if in Lyon. Take either furnicular up",

So you need to be a bit mobile to climb up all those steps. It\u2019s also used for concerts so maybe they had the first digital blue screens. Less of a photo opportunity",

          "While some are hard to find, it is worth the detour to discover them. So clever, so artistic. They add a lot of life to areas that you may never ever have paid attention to. Best to pick up a map of the sites or take a tour which I think must exist.",

          "All murals say more than they seem to say. These say a lot about Lyonnaise culture and heroes but they also say much about how the Lyonnaise see themselves and their city. The absence of tags speaks of respect, even among disaffected youth who normally put graffiti wherever they",
          "You don't have to be an art lover to appreciate these wonderful works of art. They are so realistic that you feel as if the painted doors or aindows are actually real and you go closer for a clearer view.Similarly the people on these artworks are so realistic. Whole buildings",
          "I liked the painted walls very much. It was delightful to come across them by accident and be startled, and to think, 'Is this the real life, is this just fantasy?'. They are so realistic and unexpected. We made a special journey out to museum Tony Garnier which is on the tram",
          "A little startling the first time you see it, what appears to be a flat iron building on the edge of the river Sa\u00f4ne is quite the site from all three sides. Just outside of the centre of the districts on the Island between the river Sa\u00f4ne and Rhone it is an easy walk through",

          "These huge building sized frescos seem so real and you can see them in many parts of the old town. The theme behind the frescos vary and is drawn from history. It is very easy to miss these as they seem so realistic. Don't go in search of these. You will come across these when",

          "Another project I read about before going to view. Not being from France, I do not know about most of the people represented, so it was an educational visit, will read further to learn more. Great way to present info to the public and try to make the city a better place.",
          "Absolutely loved the murals. So much detail one can stand there for 1/2 hour looking at them and discovering all different elements to the murals. They are beautifully painted and makes Lyon come alive. We were fortunate to have plenty of time to take photos and stop and enjoy",

          "The Gadagne is a small museum at the center of the old city of Lyon. The museum is housed in a fascinating four storey building of the 16th century owned by two brothers from Florence who lived in Lyon. The museum has two sections, one that covers a wide range of Lyon\u2019s",
          "The setting is great, but the museum is disappointing. More like an exhibition of some interesting pieces from the archives, hardly any interesting object to see. Lyon has a 2000-old, fascinating history and should deserve more.",
          "lots of stuff to see, be quick on the first rooms as not really interesting... the part on the corporations of Lyon (18th cent) is way better. Huge building which would take too long if you wander too much so just go as you walk.. not a must seen but Worth the time if you have",
          "In Musee Gadgane you'll find 2 museums in one charming building: History museum that has a very interesting audio-guide that explains about Lyon's history during several centuries and a smaller Marionettes museum that is quite charming. You can buy a combined ticket for both",
          "The building itself is of great interest, in that its corners and shafts have been used imaginatively. There are translations of most of the information boards. In the more-recent history sections there are many on display with some topics, such as Freemasonry and Revolutions,",
          "I love museums, lived in Lyon, and wanted to learn what happened in Lyon in comparison with the better know history of Paris. The amount of content is overwhelming. I spent over four hours and had to have my audio guide replaced when the batteries ran out. I particularly liked",
          "The museum is big, but is not that interesting. It is the usual old style museum with boring displays. I did not learn much about Lyon history.",
          "Lyon has a long history and the story of its development is extremely well told in the first of these museums. Exhibits are arranged partly chronologically by floor and partly by genre: this can be confusing if you are bent on specific research, but I recommend wandering at will",

          "The Musee Gadagne is a wonderful little museum about the history of Lyon, as well as another section of the museum devoted to marionettes (which are closely tied to the history). We didn't see the marionette section, but the history was wonderful! It was free for students and",
          "The Musee Gadgne are in fact two museums under one roof. The first museum provides a cursory overview of Lyon's modern history which thanks much of its prosperity to its central location and the fabric industry. There are plenty of maps to display the changes in the landscape",
          "well, i must admit that we did not visit either of the museums but we did find a lovely garden on the roof. very peaceful. it is next to the cafe.",
          "If you want to know how Lyon came to be, this is the place to visit. Make sure you ask for an audio guide.",
          "Wonderful museum setting out the long history of Lyon, including the traditional puppets of France. Easy to get around and see the displays, very well set out and english explanation sheets. The restaurant has helpful staff and good food.",
          "For greater enjoyment of a visit to Lyon we recommend visiting here to appreciate the history of the city with its unique geography.",
          "This museum is extensive - its focus is the history of Lyon. I recommend a visit - The Cafe at the Musuem is truly Excellent! Best Coffee in Lyon - It is a nice place to linger..",

          "A beautiful building, but very little information available about its history. Three museums in one (puppets, history of Lyon, and a special exhibition on gastronomy). The puppet part was fine. The gastronomy exhibition targets the French rather than the international visitor.",
          "not really worth Euro 9 per person .... Quite a lot to see, but could do with better explanations despite having recorded guide ... Which went on too much! An hour is enough there and food exhib on Lyon fairly disappointing ... Too many old menus on display and not much ele!",
          "Sadly our guide book had wrong opening times for this. Closed Monday Tuesday",
          "A great help in grasping the rich history of Lyon, covering significant time periods to almost present. The display drew me in so much that I bought a book on the subject at the bookshop afterwards.",
          "Do you like history? Puppets and marionettes? Then you will like this museum which is a peculiar combination of the history of the city and a history of puppet shows for the general public. But Lyon claims that it was the city that put puppets on the map. I enjoyed visiting for",
          "this large and impressive building is down a back street in old lyon. lots to see, from paintings to furniture and more centered on local history of lyon through the centuries. the puppet museum in same building made us laugh and reminded us of our childhood! theres a very nice"

        "wiki": "La Place Bellecour is a large square in the centre of Lyon, France, to the north of the Ainay district. Measuring 312 m by 200 m (62,000 m\u00b2 or 15 acres),  it is one of the largest open squares (i.e. without any patches of greenery or trees) in Europe, and the third biggest square in France, behind the Place des Quinconces in Bordeaux (126,000 m\u00b2) and the Place de la Concorde in Paris (86,400 m\u00b2). It is also the largest pedestrian square in Europe: vehicles are allowed in Places de la Concorde and des Quinconces.\nIn the middle is an equestrian statue of king Louis XIV by Fran\u00e7ois-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lemot (1825). Another statue, representing the Petit Prince and Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, is at the west end of the square. The square also has two pavilions, housing the tourist information office of Lyon and an art gallery.\nThe square is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThis square forms the central focus of the Presqu'\u00eele (peninsula), between the Sa\u00f4ne and the Rh\u00f4ne, in the 2nd arrondissement of Lyon. It hosts the Lyon tourist office and the central post office. It is a focus of the city's shopping streets: four major streets (two of them pedestrianised) start here: the Rue de la R\u00e9publique, leading to the H\u00f4tel de Ville and the Opera Nouvel; the Rue Victor-Hugo and the Rue du Plat both lead to Perrache; and the Rue du Pr\u00e9sident \u00c9douard Herriot, with a concentration of luxury shops and leading to the Place des Terreaux. The quarter of Vieux Lyon and the Lyon Cathedral face the square over the Sa\u00f4ne.\nPlace Bellecour is the kilometer 0 of Lyon: all distances are counted from this point.\nThe square's metro station, also called Bellecour, is the intersection of lines A and D. The square is also served by many buses, including 10, 14 and 88.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the Gallo-Roman era, the quarter of Bellecour was an alluvial island. In Roman times, the quarter had military and commercial activities: remains of huts which served as warehouses for traders and Gallo-Roman boatmen, called Canabae, have been found in this area.In the late 12th century, the archbishop of Lyon had a vineyard there called Bella curtis (Beau jardin in French). Abandoned, the area became swampy.\nIn 1562, Fran\u00e7ois de Beaumont, baron des Adrets attacked Lyon, installed his soldiers on the \"Pr\u00e9 de Belle-cour\".In 1604, Henry IV forced the Lyon City Council to acquire what by then had become a pasture in order to create a public square, but the heirs of the Archbishop challenged this order in court, resulting in an interminable trial.\nMany years later, in 1708, Louis XIV obtained the ownership of the square. In 1715, it became the Place Royale. Named Place Louis-le-Grand, it was adorned with a bronze statue of the king made by Martin Desjardins. Around the square, some buildings were then constructed whose fa\u00e7ades were designed by Robert de Cotte, the first architect of Louis XIV.\nDuring the French Revolution, an altar dedicated to Liberty was erected on the square on 14 July 1790. The square changed its name and became the Place de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration. A guillotine was installed here in 1792. The royal statue was destroyed in 1793, and the square was then named Place de l'\u00c9galit\u00e9.\nOn 21 June 1800, Napoleon I, after his victory at Marengo, laid the foundation stone for new buildings. The square was renamed Place Bonaparte, later Place Napol\u00e9on. During the Bourbon Restoration, in 1825, a new statue of Louis XIV was erected.\nIt was only under the French Third Republic that the square took its current name: Place Bellecour.\n\n\n== Statues ==\n\nIn the center of the square, there is an equestrian statue of Louis XIV by Fran\u00e7ois-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lemot. It is accompanied, at his feet, by two allegorical statues of the Sa\u00f4ne and the Rh\u00f4ne, created by the brothers Nicolas and Guillaume Costou in 1720. The base came from a village in the Beaujolais: Le Perr\u00e9on.\nThe first statue was created in 1713 and destroyed during the French Revolution, in 1793, to make cannon. In 1825, the current statue, sculpted in Paris by Fran\u00e7ois-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lemot, was installed in the square. It was transported to Lyon in twelve days on a coupling drawn by twenty-four horses. The entrance of the statue into the city was a festive occasion that attracted a big audience.\nThere is also a statue of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry sitting in front of the Little Prince. It was erected in 2000 for the centenary of the aviator's birth.\n\n\n== Main events ==\nThroughout the year, a number of events take place on Place Bellecour :\n\nIn winter, an ice rink is installed.\nThere are sometimes concerts and events, including a book fair or a distribution of the \"Petit Paum\u00e9\".\nStudent or trade union demonstrations often pass through.\nOn the weekend of Pentecost, there is a p\u00e9tanque competition.\nEvery Friday night, the square is the starting point of a roller ride.\nIn winter, a 60-meter Ferris wheel is installed. Previously this was on the Place Antonin Poncet, but since 2006, due to extensive works, the wheel is located nearby, on the Place Bellecour. It is dismantled in early March.\n\n\n== Panorama ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of streets and squares in Lyon\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in French) Lyon Passionn\u00e9ment: the Place Bellecour\n(in French) Aerial view of the square\n(in French) History of the equestrian statue of Louis XIV\n(in French) Embellishment of the place Bellecour",

          "Our apartment is a one minute walk from this huge square but we noticed there were quite a few homeless young people with dogs and their belongings all laid out on the sidewalk across from the square. (infront of Monop) It is a shame because this unsightly scene detracts from",
          "The La Place Bellecour is a vast picturesque square (312m by 200m) in the centre of Lyon and is one of the largest open squares in Europe. In the centre of the square is a large statue of Louis XIV with impressive bronze sculptures on two sides of the base. The square has",

          "My fully loaded bicycle was stolen here. Police didn't even want me to write a report. A horrible experience. Be aware you are a target for theft (and the police don't care).",
          "My principal reason for visiting was to see the statue of my favourite author Antoinne de Saint Exupery which is situated in the square. I happened to visit on a saturday during the yellow vests protests. The statue is located in the far left hand corner, actually just outside",
          "This is a grand old square with some wonderful buildings to look at and plenty of places to sit and rest (the tourist info office is also here). Both rivers are nearby too. Two things spoil this otherwise pleasant square - Lyon has several electric scooter companies - a lot of",

          "Worth visiting if you were planning on being in the area, especially if you were going to visit Vieux Lyon. We had a car so used the car park underneath Place Bellecour, expensive but well located. There is a Sunday market to peruse just around the corner by the river.",

          "If the square were in London, Copenhagen, Paris or Rome; then I think it would have been used for better purpose. It is litterally just an open space without anything, And the underlay itself is pretty ugly.",

          "The biggest and proudest of all Lyon\u2019s public spaces. It\u2019s so big that you might use landmarks within it (like the giant Ferris wheel or the statue of Louis XIV) to help you get around. Lots of cool street performers and stuff like that, too.",

          "we rented an apartment across the street, so place Belcour was convenient to sit in the sun with a glass of wine or an ice cream; one afternoon there was a huge demonstration by CGT, kept well under control by CRS",
          "Beautiful old square with a great view of the Basilica. Nice gardens and good for people watching. Continue north through quaint winding streets to explore old Lyon.",
          "South of the main shopping area, it's where most busses pass through and where a main information centre is (south side). Useful HSBC cashpoint here (east side, not north as shown on googlemaps). Not much else here.",
          "Beautiful city one of my favourites. Some class hotels and some great eateries which you would expect. Great times here. I love Lyon.",
          "This large square in Lyon is in a busy location and has some nice features along one side such as flowers, shade and small shops, but the square itself is just asphalt and gravel with a statue of Louis XIV on a horse in the middle. The space is definitely in need of something",
          "I've never seen such a huge place! Plus it's an excellent starting point for going up to Fourviere's colline and Vieux Lyon.",
          "This place is huge and open, and the buildings surrounding it are not that impressive but still nice. The statue in the middle is cool, and there are lots of nice places to eat nearby.",
          "Our hotel was on this square but apart from the tourist information there wasn't much else here. As we visited in August when most of lyon is shut for the holidays maybe it has more going on during the year. Walk down to the river where it is much more vibrant.",
          "Most of the time the square is empty and doesn't look very hospitable due to its vast proportions. Not my favorite in Lyon...",
          "The monument was large and interesting. The space was fantastic and well worth a visit. It was tidy and clean and a wonderful meeting area",
          "Large esplanade in the city center, plenty of nice places to rest and drink, chic and urban and close to everything",
          "Huge open area with immediate access to stared restaurants.ancient monuments.top shopping.the kids can run ariund and let off steam.couples can walk hand in hand soaking up the french atmosphere.often a huge wheel to enjoy views if the while city.",
          "Maybe when there is an event going on, it can be interesting. Otherwise it's just a big empty area, not even landscaped well.",
          "A big plazza in the center of the city, the biggest in Europe (over 16 hectars), good place for promenade, the starting point of the tour bus.",
          "Anything at the periphery of this large place is more interesting and inviting, than the center of the place itself. So instead of crossing just walk around it and find a variety of interesting shops, restaurants and also the Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry memorial.",
          "You will have some good time if you go with a family or friends. There is a nice river close to this attraction and also there are some churches and good cafes that you can visit at the same time. The best is to enjoy a coffee after you had a long walk to visit this place along",
          "In the centre of the city and where you will find the Hop on Hop off bus but also the wonderful statue of Louis 1V",
          "A very busy and vibrant square with several caf\u00e9s, restaurants and places to sit, enjoy your lunch, and people watch. The square hosts many events throughout the year and week, be sure to look out for them in order to enjoy, or miss the potential crowds.",
          "There is not much here nowadays. You walk through or around on your way somewhere else.....unless there is an event going on.",
          "Still not too sure why you need a market square that is so large, but it is certainly worth visiting and taking in the really French atmosphere",
          "OK, an open space, nothing to really write home about. Just happens to be there between other roads...",
          "In my opinion this has to be one of the ugliest squares I've visited - it's supposed to be one of the largest open squares in Europe i.e. no grass or trees. It does hold regular events which is what draws people to it and there's numerous cafes in and around the square.",
          "This week they had a few days with a exhibition with many different countries. Free entrance and very funny to visit!",
          "The place can be reached by C9 bus from the main train station. It was just a big open space but a must see in Lyon. Several restaurants, coffee shops and shopping outlets are present in the area.",
          "I don't get the big draw here. It's a big square with a statue. I wouldn't waste my time. Lyon is just a big city with a river running through it. I will never return.",
          "There is a large open square where there are a lot of activities depending upon the time of the day and the season. In June during day time it is too hot to visit there.",
          "big square where lot of activities can take place there depending on the season and you casn enjoy walking in this square and chilling.",
          "Place Bellecour is a large expansive area in need of crowds to justly fulfil its destiny, as it no doubt has in the past. But, on a sunny day in April, it was mostly just an impressive, if largely empty, open space with good views of the hillside Basilica in the near distance.",
          "This contains the very busy information centre. Rather attractive but mainly unwelcoming hard surfaces and worth a few photos but little to occupy your time",
          "Fabulous largest square in Europe. Grab a seat at one of the self service cafes and watch the sun go down with a glass of chilled white wine.",
          "Nice Area , middel of everything Restaurants all over , information Center Its near. Nice for walking around",
          "I always have a hard time understanding the need for such large place. Yes it's nice and yes it has nice buildings around but when there is not a fair or something going on, the place is completely empty and has no real use. It feels like a waste of space. Anyway, i think this",
          "It's a must-see because the Tourist Bureau is located in the far corner. Otherwise, it is simply a large open square dominated by a humongous statue of the Louis the 14th. It's not a very human-scale square. There are no cafes or benches here. It is a square to walk through.",
          "A square, get info at the tourist desk and move on to the north or the old part. HlJjshhshaggahhahgf",
          "This big open square is dominated by a statue of Louis IX on horseback. The tourist information centre is in one corner of the square. There are lots of cafes and restaurants nearby and the hop-on hop-off bus terminus is here.",
          "A very large square central to Lyon which is Interesting in it's own right for, the architecture' and statuary",
          "With Louis 13th in the middle. It's so big that it feels slightly empty most of the time, but it's a fantastic place to take a break, hit the tourist office if you need more information, and have a picnic. Also great views of Fourviere hill from the square.",
          "Place Bellecour is a big piece of real estate but it's literally just a big open space of land with a statue in the middle. Perhaps things like markets or carnivals, etc. happen here but there was nothing like that when I was there.",
          "Large city square worth visiting if you are a tourist. Not much is there but there is a nice view of the Notre Dam.",
          "I didn't find the Place Bellecour worth the walk. It was very large and open, with not many places to sit and even fewer in the shade. Most large urban squares have cafes around the edges. I only saw one on the actual square. There are some gardens and playgrounds around the",
          "This is a huge empty square with a large statue of Louis IV in the middle, and nothing else... Ok, there are not many square's this big and perhaps on market day or some festival or whatever, this is a very nice huge area to have it on, but on a regular tuesday morning I saw",
          "By chance I walked through this charming square yesterday. It is not really a destination place but if you are walking around Lyon it is worth a small detour to walk across it and view the huge statue.",
          "This is a good size open air square. There is an Equestrian statue of king Louis 14 in the middle. - there is nothing much to see when there is no events. Pretty much same as other big Squares in Cuba, China or Russia.........big Empty Open Air Square One good thing is you",
          "Well worth a visit. Lovely statue and monumental scale in the center of Lyon. A definite must for any tourist.",
          "There are many different attractions that flow from this square. Most importantly the Tourist Office in located there. We found this a particularly good place to visit and get directions. Shopping is excellent from the both sides....and you can walk though the square on either",
          "Stunning views and large gathering place in the heart of Lyon! There are many shops and cafes around to enjoy the people watching.",
          "A must visit. Walking distance to everything. It's a very attractive squre. Very safe. Some very good restaurants nearby. It will take you to rue de la Republique.",
          "This is a big square with restaurants etc on the perimeter and a couple on the square itself. There are sometimes entertainers or musicians playing.",
          "I guess you need to see it but it's basically a big flat square. Toilets are on the back of tourist information.",
          "This is a great area! Has a great pizzaria right in front of it. Great to have a nice walk, see the stores. Loved it",
          "Very impressive square covered with red sand which makes it stand out from the white buildings surrounding it. Dominated by a statue of Louis IV and in one corner there is a statue of St.Exupery with the Little Prince looking over his shoulder.",
          "The Place is huge and is not in itself that attractive. The architecture of the buildings that surround it are quite grand and give a good reflection of the rest of the city. There is not much greenery and it is dusty when the weather is hot and dry. It is however at the heart",
          "A broad expanse in the middle of the city. Walking into Bellecour Square is somewhat surreal. You are walking the narrow streets and then, boom, you are in a vast square surrounded by a bustling city filled with shops, restaurants, and tourists too.",
          "Place Bellecour is very centrally located and most Lyon tourists will visit it, as the main Lyon tourist office is located on the square. The square is bounded by well restored and elegant building, and from the center of the square, you have nice views of the Fourvi\u00e8re Hill and",
          "Constructed to fit Napoleon's army, it is a plaza you will come across most probably even if not meant to.",
          "A must see in Lyon, very centrally located, beautiful architecture & close to all other major attractions in Lyon.",
          "Bounded by rows of elegant five- and six-story buildings housing shops on the ground floor and offices and apartments above, this vast space is perfect for a stroll, a cool drink in an open-air cafe, a visit to the Tourism Office in the southeast corner of the square, or",
          "Open space with shops around and toilets. Views of the Basilique on the hill. Coffee shops and ice cream available.",
          "It is located at the centre of Lyon, an empty square to relax, enjoy the French life, with live music being performed, with a beer in hand makes it unbeatable... Its close to the shopping street, to river Rhone and Soane and to the Funicular train...",
          "I'm not really sure what else to add. I walked through about three times on total. One time there was an event on which worked well in the space and would recommend if there was something on. Otherwise....it's a big square for events, if nothing is on there really isn't much to",
          "I loved getting pretty little bites to eat and sitting in the Place Bellecour on many a sunny day in the heart of Lyon. Nearby are old-world artisan shops, a range of high to medium-end clothing shops, and fabulous people-watching. It is the place to go when in Lyon.",
          "Place Bellecour is the center of the city, to see historical places, make some shopping, drink coffee and sightseeing. Nice enviroment",
          "Wide square with seats and cafes. The Lyon tourist office is also located where you can get lots of information on what to do and see in Lyon.",
          "A lot of very good views from this square right in the city centre, and also several shops for Lyonnaise specialties on its borders.",
          "A big square in the middle of the city. Nice place at nice with the Ferris wheel view. But that's it.",
          "If you are staying in Lyon, you cannot miss this central square, it is the very center of the town. Supposedly kilometre Zero of the town, it is the starting point or arriving point of all public transportation lines. The locals claim this is the largest square in Europe, but it",
          "it's just a big, empty square. the only thing to see is the statue of king louis XIV which looks so tiny in the huge space. so much wasted space.",
          "This place is perfect for a group to have as a meeting point, everything is nice around here and you can't miss the spot because of the massive wheel. They also have the tourist center here and alot of restaurants:)",
          "Can visit if someone has extra free time and wants to explore more and more places within a city. You can get little hang of local culture and local food here.",
          "Open place very easly reached for couples kids tourists local people. Metro station directly in front it. A lot of activities happen at this place.",
          "Excellent place to visit, a key one for lyon citizens. Many of them are used to have a meeting point under the horse tail. So if one day you are lost or have no battery, here is the meeting point",
          "Large citi square in the heart of Lyon in the center of \"like Island\" (between two soon- joining rivers Ron and Son). With a tourist information, monument of Louis XIV, metro station, The Wheel (open late evening, also in the winter, nicely iluminated). With some nice store",
          "It was one of the largest squares in France, with a wheel that offered panoramic views over the city. Very crowded although it was a rather cold and rainy day of January.",
          "A great meeting point which drives to many shops! Big & clean Ideal for families with kids special in spring or summer! With ability to many activities",
          "Lovely squire but a shame there is a hugh ferrisweel in the winter. This takes some of the grandure away.",
          "Place Bellecour was right off our hotel and a really nice square to walk through. Off the squares were lots of shopping and right on Place Bellecour were some really cute shops. Even in the winter it was really busy with tourist and locals alike.",
          "Place Bellecour is the main square in Lyon and here you can find everything. Shops, tourist information points, bars, restaurants and so on. In the middle of the square there is a huge statue of Louis XIV.",
          "Great place for periodic \"regrouping\" when traveling with others. It was convenient for us (Metro stop). A band was playing. The sun was shining. It was cold and fun.The statue of King Louis XIV is great to see and cannot be missed. Also Ferris wheel provides great views.",
          "We settled for the Saone Apartment- 5 Place Bellecour due to its central proximity to our tourist attraction sites in Lyon. Historic sites, Basilique Notre-Dame de Fourviere, Grand Theatre Antique Et Odeon... are within a 1.5km radius. Either side of Bellecour are the Rhone",
          "Our accommodation was a short walk from Place Bellecour,so we did spend time walking around and through Place Bellecour, its very good for taking photos of the area.",
          "It was a business trip to Lyon and the first day after work, I decided to visit Bellecour. The moment I stepped out of the metro-station, my eyes could not believe the beautiful views all around. It's a perfect place to spend a wonderful evening. Just keep walking across the",
          "It was an awesome day trip to Place Bellecour - just walking around and taking in the sights - friendly folk assisting where they could and a host of restaurants - take your pick....they cater for all moods",
          "The square was really beautiful especially at night time, The ferris wheel lit up in such beautiful colours and the surrounding streets were all decorated with Christmas lights which really created a perfect atmosphere to walk in.",
          "We stopped by here while on a tour of Europe with Insight Vacations. As it was in early May there wasn't a lot of things going on. It looks like there would be plenty of opportunity as this square is huge. We did get a chance to sit by a outside cafe and enjoy a liquid",
          "and this is the real color of the soil , what abig and impresive place in the heard of Lyon, one should pass there , and just sit look at the big wheele ,also the tourist information office is there.",
          "It is the main square in Bellcour area where you can find shopping street, tourist information and view of Notre Fame up on the hill.",
          "Before the use of mobile phones, and even today, all rendez vous were made conveniently under the \" tail of louis 14 th\" horse. The statue sits in the middle of place bellecour, in the heart of the presqu ile, between two major rivers. Saone and rhone. This is a good place to",
          "If you look at the photo you'll see the Cathedral and Fourviere Hill on the horizon which like this place is a must see in Lyon. It is also adjacent to one of the main shopping precincts and eating area's. We found it a great place to meet and venture out from.",
          "It was awesome but very cold and at night very horrible because there was no activities and very small city.",
          "I think Was better...But when I saw it...nothing. ..is Very very big But empty. ..With nothing inside...",
          "Surrounded by History the place is really a good place to visit. Walk, have lunch, shop local and non-local but all nice things in the small shops.",
          "Each Sunday in massive Place Bellecour, there is a modest stamp collecting market get-together featuring a group of men and women who are interested in all things philatelic. There are some genuine rarities here and not all are from France. The hours seem to be morning only",
          "A huge square with a magnificent view on the Fourviere hill is encircled with cafes, restaurants, and boutiques, including the famous Institut Paul Bocuse. The pavilion shelters the City Tourist Office.",
          "You can walk around. It is a great place. There are shops around. It is a big place and you can continue walking to explore the city.",
          "Nothing special about this square, except the view to the Fourviere hill. Good to sit and look at the masses of people passing by: I think the square itself is not much of a sight.",
          "This is the place you need to have seen when visiting Lyon. Generally it is just one big open space and nothing special, but for the inhabitants it is the main meeting place in town and their real city center. The place is surrounded by nice buildings, you are close to nice",
          "Half of the square was closed as it was the Lyon marathon. The fountain was also closed off!! I guess had all that been missing it would be a fantastic place with a great view of the buildings.",
          "This is central to everywhere and a good place to arrange to meet up with anyone. The tourist office is available here in the square and there are some lovely places to eat, in the restaurants around the square area. We sat in the beautiful weather and just ate and drank",

          "Use a scooter, walk, run, sing- It's a safe place to be in Lyon. Either you have an ice cream or baguette- It's perfectly fine to just sit down. If you have children with you- try having a stroller- as this can be a very tiring place ... Toilet can be a challenge here - so",
          "Large open square with Louis 14th on horseback, Hotels around and some busy roads leading through Lyon",
          "Buy a sandwich at the bar nearby and have lunch with a view in this attractive space near the centre of Lyon",
          "A huge area, I would assume at some times it would be utilized, but it seemed to me that it could have so many cultural, restaurant, market, visitor friendly uses - it seemed to be only utilized by one (very bad) evangelistic speaker.",
          "the square is large. The Tourist Office is at one end of the square. It is close to the Musee Decoratifs and the Musee Tissus. Nearby is the colorful flower tree of metal. The Bocuse Institute is on the corner, just opposite the Tourist Office. It is a good starting point.",
          "The Place Bellecour itself is not very interesting, but the shops and restaurants around it are. We recommend a stroll on the Rue Victor Hugo (lots of shops) and especially the Rue de Marronniers (lots of bars and restaurants).",
          "Other than it's size there is nothing really remarkable about this square. It is at the end of the main shopping street and there is an important metro station which bring a lot of people making it a very well known landmark.",
          "I like places where you visit without tickets, people sit on the side and you do your own thing. The place was huge, but in a sunny day you need to make sure that you have an umbrella or hat.",

          "Place Bellecour - the biggest plaza in France, filled with nothing except big statue in the middle. But just right there you will find a helpful Tourist Office, Metro station and many restaurants/cafes around. Walking distance to Old City, funicular to Fourviere Hill, Place des",
          "This is one of the biggest squares we have ever visited.It is very big, and most of the buildings around it seem to be residential. However, it is clearly a major local landmark, so it`s worth taking a look. We did not notice many cafes or eating places in the square.",
          "Huge Place, and obviously were popular with tourists and locals. Streets of restaurants fan out from it. Great to sit out and watch the world go by. Many bars and restaurants nearby",
          "I imagine that it'd be amazing when the large events are taking place there which our friends described. However, it was just a large square with a statue to us. Teeny play park in one corner. It was fine...a square...",
          "Massive \"square\" with lots of photo opportunities including Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re up on the hill in the distance. A few restaurants near by too so as to be able to sit and soak up the atmosphere.",
          "We stayed right on Place Bellecour with our windows overlooking the square. In the 8 weeiks we stayed it seemed there was just about always something happening there. Whether it be protests about something, or Paralympian previews, it always kept us entertained",
          "Great place to stroll around, very peaceful. Good views of city, cafes, toilets, fountains. Well worth a visit.",
          "A good meeting place with views of the Basilique and a statue of Louis XIV. There is sometimes a Ferris wheel that has good views of the city, but is extremely overpriced.",
          "This huge place gives me the creeps ... It's so huge, it's weird such a huge place in a city like this. The views are superb, but I don't feel good on this place. Strange ...",
          "Located in the centre of the city section which is built between the Saone and Rhone rivers, this square is a perfect spot to get a feel for this vibrant, historical and cultural city. Look up on the hill and you have great views to the Basilica and the model of the Eiffel",
          "The fanzone for Euro 2016 was held in Place Bellecour and it was the perfect venue. Great views of Fourviere, surrounded by the city, right in the city centre and perfectly flat for staging the fanzone with easy views of big screens.",
          "Visited the place Bellecour on several days during Euro 2016. The vast size of the square meant everyone could enjoy themselves, whatever they were there for - football or sightseeing. The atmosphere was always friendly, even during the screening of live matches. The proximity",
          "Squares don't come much bigger than the red asphalt desert of Place Bellecour which is the crossing point of the 2 main Metro lines. In the middle is a statue of King Louis XIV on horseback with some other bronzes either side of the plinth. On the south side is the Tourist",
          "Nice place to visit while in Lyon, the scene is pleasing and its a great meeting point. A must visit place while in Lyon",
          "Great place to hang out and watch the passersby. Tons of stores nearby to browse along rue de Republique and a good supply of restaurants. Pass a couple of hours and check it out.",
          "Go there first thing on a Sunday morning ... there's nobody else about and you really get to experience the scale of this place. And it's so quiet at this time of day.",
          "Although this is the largest civic space in Lyon, and one of the largest such in France, it truly fails to inspire. Use it only as a point of reference, or to visit the city's tourism office. Just a bunch of pink pebbles brimming in history. Good to catch bus transfers, and",
          "Enjoyable stroll around this park nearby some excellent shopping. Great view of the Basilica on top of the hill. Worth a brief visit traipsing to and from Old Town Lyon.",
          "For the people from Lyon, Bellecour square is the place to go when you want to go out. Enjoy the republique street, and go to the city hall, passing near the fountain of the republic !",
          "Can only advise what this square was like during the Euros as it was buzzing and a hive of activity but it is obviously a beautifully laid out square with the usual selection of civic pride statues. Very handy for the underground as there is a station right underneath the square",
          "Bellecour is, so I'm told, the largest pedestrian square in Europe. It certainly is big. In the two weeks that we have been staying next to it there have been things happening, keeping the square alive. For the first few days the European Football Cup was on and Bellecour was",
          "Nice enough square across the old city bridge, the architecture is not too old, a couple of baroque era buildings. I guess the old city in Lyon has limited options compared to Strasbourg and some other French cities.",
          "THis place is the Hub. In the winter, the ferris wheel is towering, in summer it hosts festivals. Right around the corner, on the Rhone. every Sunday,there is the Sunday market, Which was essential to my survival in France. There is one man who was responsible for taming my",
          "Place Bellecour appears to be the hub of the central city, and is a lively place. We passed through each day, stopping for a drink or some food - there are so many options around the square. It's a great place to stop and watch the city go by with a drink. The tourist info is",
          "This square has its own particular charm because it is one of the largest open squares in France without any tree or anything that could block the view of the beautiful basilica at the top of the hill. Also any important event can be celebrated in it, so it is very common to see",
          "Did not see the place Bellecour at its best as was being used as Fan Park for Euro 2016. Sure it is very pleasant.",
          "What an enormous square! Very easy to get there with the subway, the place des Jacobins is really close as is the delightful Rue Merci\u00e8re. I was there also on the Sunday during the Euro soccer game France -Ireland, and it was a sight to see! Very good security and",
          "Was here during the Euros so visited the fan zone so cant really comment on the Place as much as the fan Zone was located here. Great buzz about it and just at the bottom/top of the shopping street. Seemed to be a square that locals visited and sat around as there were benches.",
          "The Place Bellecour is in the centre of the city and is a great place to arrange to meet with friends as it has it's own metro station. There are plenty of shops, pubs and restaurants in the adjacent area.",
          "As far as European squares go this is not the prettiest but it has ample benches to just sit and take in the city. Unfortunately I could t enjoy it's full capacity due to large barriers and signage for the Euro cup.",
          "My purpose of visiting Lyon was to see a friend and her family but Lyon gave me a very deep impression. With the laidback atmosphere and a city still with old charm, I really liked the place though I'm only there for a day. Wish I could stay longer the next time",
          "A huge area which is largely empty, except for the majestic statue of the king and the Tourist Office, but also the hundreds of visitors who just keep on passing by. At the time of our visit there was a boules tournament going on and there were dozens of participants happily",
          "Taken to see this large 'Place' with wonderful views and very spacious. There were 'building' works taking place with scaffolding marring the sense of space",
          "Excellent! Easy to find and what a stunning back drop of the chapel. Easy access. Lots of friendly people too",
          "Honestly, most of Lyon is point-the-camera beautiful - absolutely stuffed full of renaissance buildings with the odd bit of medieval and Roman mixed in. This square is a central hub to the area between the two rivers and hosts the main (excellent) tourist office. Check it, and",
          "Perfect for the Euro 16 Fanzone, this large central square is home to the central tourist office, where the staff were excellent. Buses and Metro connections are, as you might expect, excellent. I assume that everything on the square is more expensive than in the streets just",
          "Lyon is a fabulous city, rich in history and filled with interesting places to visit. This is a good starting place!",
          "Centre square with a nearby old town and many restaurant and shopping experiences. Served as a Euro2016 fanzone. Lovely architecture around.",
          "This is a good base to start exploring Lyon, head North up rue de la republique and see the town! Metro stop - Bellecour",
          "You could visit the square if you have the time or want to go to the tourist office situated at one end. It is a large square with an impressive statue in the middle of king Louis XIV riding a horse. You can see people just relaxing around here or practicing various sports like",
          "The only thing here that is worth seeing is the Tourist Office. Otherwise, Bellecour is a huge, empty square of very little interest or distinction. We originally went because nearly every single guidebook called Bellecour magnificent. Not so.",
          "This square is just across the Saone and is the main square of the city- it is huge. It is also the home of the tourist office- where you might meet your guide and buy tickets for the funicular.",
          "Surrounded by buildings this very large square is often full of people and activities and has a small cafe (buvette)at one side. The Tourist office is there and any of the adjoining areas with pedestrian malls or small streets is worth walking. Museums are found on some of the",
          "You will find the tourist office here, two minutes walk from the Rhone. They were holding a boules tournament here while we were there.",
          "Unfortunately this large Plaza is undergoing major construction work, which has cut it off from any visits.",
          "This is an impressive square not very far from the square of Jacobins. You could walk to this place. The locals are busy practicing many sports activities here. There is also a huge elegant statue in the middle. If you are walking around town you will not miss this place.",
          "Huge square, also accommodating the Tourist Information Centre. Weekends see the local boules competitions and other events. Also a meeting point for local organisations and rallies, which can make an interesting spectacle. Worth heading from the square towards the Rhone, for a",
          "Large area where there is always something going on therefore there is always something to see. The square is surrounded by cafes. There are places for children to play and adults to sit and chat or relax.",
          "Wandering around after the rugby final the night before, we came upon this magnificent place which was being used for a Boules competition. The whole area was buzzing and it was great fun. Plenty of decent cafes surrounding the area and plenty of toilets.",
          "A place where u can relax and refresh. The garden near place Bellecour is worth to walk around Tourists information center is right on the heart of the place",
          "There are places on the side of the square where you can get a drink and there are many restaurants only a block away. During WWII the Germans publicly executed 5 resistance fighters here.",
          "When we visited at the end of April it was quiet, sparse and dull. Just a wide open space. The ferris wheel wasn't there and I didn't really see the point of it?! I wouldn't class it as an attraction in it's own right!",
          "this is nice place for family outing. lot of place for children to play. very nice and attractive buildings",
          "Plenty of space here and a few monuments to see but not much else. The ground is not sealed and gets quite dusty when the wind blows.",
          "It is an impressively large space, but is somewhat bleak. The cathedral on the hill behind the Old Town provides a magnificent backdrop. If the Place had more trees for shade, it would be much improved. In the NW corner of the Place there is a cute statue of Antoine de St.",
          "What is it with the French and horrible grass-free gravel squares? This is an immensely big square - one of the biggest in Europe I believe - and there's nothing in it aside from a statue. Helpfully it does have an exceptionally good tourist bureau at one of the edges of the",
          "In this square you will find a tourist office and very little else. I was expecting restaurants or cafes or points of interest, however, it is a bare square with a fountain and a tourist office. Additionally, the tourist office offers very little in terms of walking city",
          "This is the busy central 'hub' of the 2nd arrondissment where the tourist information is situated. Beautiful architecture surrounds a red graveled square where jugglers and other interesting artist gather. Metro lines available just off the square.",
          "It reminds me France during the 16th and 17th century, with large squares, tall magnificent buildings around them, open spaces, monuments and art-works. Definitely worth to visit",
          "Our hotel overlooked Place Bellecour and it was fun and interesting to watch the people come and go - tour groups, families with children, individuals on their way to and from work - a maze of activity.",
          "BEST PLACE FOR SHOPPING AND EATING. It is the heart of Lyon. there is one bakery there that sells a very good Le Parisian.",
          "I have to be honest and say- it's a bit disappointing in and of itself. An utterly massive square that i am sure looks impressive when full of smartly presented soldiers in dress uniform, but otherwise a bit boring and empty. The centre piece of course is the statue of Louis",
          "Bellecour is a very empty place, just with one monument. but it's cool. you have a vieu to the cathedrale fourvi\u00e8re and the \"mini eiffel Tower\".",
          "This square is large with numerous caf\u00e9s and restaurants to sit and relax at. The square has several fountains and benches that make this an ideal place for an impromptu picnic. The birds and people with exotic cars/motorcycles can be a bit annoying, but not too bad. The ferris",
          "A very big court with some beautiful status. Clean and ideal on sunny days. You can talk to guides in place and they will tell all you want know about this place. There's a metro station nearby. Nice place in general",
          "Yes, it was bitterly cold. However, we thoroughly enjoyed walking through this imposing square during our six-day stay in Lyon on the way to the streets of interesting shops which branch off it. Worth heading to the Tourist Information Centre located there on the first day to",
          "Bellecour is impressive when you see it from far (like the Fourvi\u00e8re), but there is not much on the actual place. There are however regulraly different types of public events that are organised which can be interesting",
          "As well as a statue in the middle, and a huge Ferris wheel at one end, this vast square occupies the middle of the shopping and pedestrian areas. I would not take a special tour unless you are particularly interested in architecture.",
          "Nicest Square in France. Huge with its Jules Cesar dressed on a horse Louis XIV King statue. Central part of Lyon for catching up in the middle of \"Presqu'Ile\" in between Saone & Rhone Rivers. A must do. Good start also for shopping in Rue de la R\u00e9 or Rue Emile Zola.",
          "You must walk round here if you come to Lyon just to people watch if nothing else Lots of nice cafes and a good tourist office who are mega helpful and friendly",
          "The \"Place Bellecour\" square was one of the first places I visited during my very first visit to Lyon. It is simply immense, and combines many things - history, culture, space, eating, shopping, transport and tourism! If this was not enough, there was a rally / demonstration",
          "There is a beautiful view of the Basilica at the top of the hill and by walking towards the east you can see the lovely floral sculpture. The square is being remodelled but should be splendid when finished. The tourist office is there in a demountable building.",
          "I have been living in Lyon for 1 semester and I usually spend my Saturday night sitting with friends at place bellecour. It's so peaceful to be there. Would rat\u00e9 5 stars.",
          "Its a beautiful area. Heart of Lyon. Lots of shops and restaurants. A beautiful view of 2 rivers. Highly recommended if you like to spend outdoors. Walking distance to the funicular to see the beautiful Basilique. Very helpful Tourist offices. Its a must go.",
          "It's a nice big square where you will find the tourist office and public transportation. From here you can see the hill and the Basillic church and the old city center.",
          "Not much of an attraction in my opinion...a massive square, one nice statue and view of the Basilique on Fourviere Hill...that's about it.",
          "This square is a great starting point to see the rest of the city. The best shopping is just north of the square, there are great restaurants in all directions, and lots of small fun alleys to wander through. Go get lost!",
          "To me Bellecour is the hub of Lyon, with streets loaded with great shopping and some good restaurants radiating out from it in all directions. It's easy to get to via the subway and surface transportation, and is an equally easy walk to the quai on the River Rhone. The",
          "It is an impressive square with a monument to Louis XIV in the centre and a Ferris Wheel at one end. Not a lot to do here other than explore the shops and avenues around the square. But it is a good place to use for orientation. I am sure in the summer, or with the winter",
          "The Place Bellecour has pretty views around but is very large with diagonal footpath. Surely a great place for events but on a normal day a large open square with little diversion other than the statues.",
          "Very good , authentic Indian food - but took a really long time to serve the food! We had a long wait.",
          "Built under Napoleon Bonaparte's time, Place Bellecour is a big square right in the \"Presquile\" the centre of Lyon. You can spend some time there and find the tourist information bureau.",
          "The square is huge and a great place to view all around. Tourism Centre was very helpful we got our two day ticket for transport and any tours which was ideal. The Wheel was great and a fab opportunity to take photos!",
          "The Place Bellecour was mostly empty when we visited just before New Year, though I assume it was often filled with something. We took the huge ferris wheel ride, which gives great views of the city, if you're not acrophobic (or even if you are!)",
          "This is a great place to visit briefly and to start your tours of the close by attractions of Lyon. The Lyon Tourism office is located here and is incredibly helpful. The Rue Victor Hugo with great shopping is also off the square. From here you can also get to St. Jean",
          "A lovely space. Civic parking is hidden underground below this square. Tons of things to see and do in the vicinity.",
          "It was a big square but plain and uninviting. Nothing encourage visitors to stay, no seating no fountain just a sculpture and a giant fun fair wheel. People just use it like a passageway to somewhere else, not a destination.",
          "This is a huge square. Nothing particularly amazing about the square itself but it does have a tourist info centre with helpful staff, free public toilets (a small tip might be appreciated) and a ferris wheel which is fun for \u20ac9.",
          "If you visit the city of Lyon you will be here at the centre. There are nice views of the old city anf the Basilica. The transit access is easy. The Rhone and Soan can be seen.",
          "The famous Place Bellecour is the city\u2019s biggest square and in fact the third biggest square in Europe. It serves as the city\u2019s meeting place for tourists and locals and as you look upon the majestic statue of Louis XIV with the Basilica of Fourviere in the distance, you are",
          "We visited on the night the Christmas Lights festival should have opened. There was still a lot of people out enjoying the evening. With the overlooking cathedral, it was a nice place to visit. Not worth a special trip, though.",
          "Lyon is a big City and Bellecour is a wide Square in the old city with a good view for Fourviere, it is good place for walking and taking photos with the statue of Louis XIV.",
          "This place it huge with shops and restaurants lining the edges. Pretty much the center of town and easy starting point for touring Old Lyon and the attractions on top of the hill.",
          "A good place to sit and enjoy the views of Fouviere hill, the basilica and the mini Eiffel tower. The tourist information office is here and is very helpful",
          "This vast public space has been used very unimaginatively, with far, far too much barren pavement. Creating the largest pedestrian square in Europe is a signal achievement, but couldn't more effort have been put into making it an attractive, user-friendly place? Very",
          "A nice square where you can see the statue of louis xiv. We loved lyon generally... Especially the central was great. So a walk for place bellecour to the place de terreaux and back is a very good idea.",
          "This is the main centre of Lyon and serves as the place to meet or organise a day trip. Distinct lack of toilets considering how many people use this area.",
          "The biggest square in Europe, supposedly. Not hard to find the place. The view of basilique and the metal tower in the distance.",
          "I'm told it's the largest square in France. It is across the road from the Rhone river. Bordering the square are restaurants and shops. We ate at L'espace (yellow awning) and it was great.",
          "They were having some kind of health fair here when we visited Lyon, so could not really see the square, but once the fair was gone still not much to see!",
          "Place Bellecour give access to nice places around : the shopping streets, the old town and is between the two rivers. Even if you don't plan to visit it, you will probably cross it anyway. If you like big squares you can go there, but place des Terreaux is much nicer in my",
          "We rented a small apartment just a couple of blocks away from Place Bellecour, just off the pedestrian street of Victor Hugo. We walked to everything including the Basilica (a long way up a steep hill) and vieux Lyon.",
          "Spacious on the one hand and cosy on the other, there is a tourist office, a metro station, small green spaces to sit and to contemplate the surroundings. Just great among the greatests: Fourvievre on the hill at distance and the Lois XIV in the centre.",
          "Great transport links from many parts of the city. The main Tourist Office located there with very helpful staff to guide you. Buy anOnlyLyon card which gives excellent value to your visit. Free transport trips free entry to all museums, free boat rides and guided tours of",
          "The word 'attraction' is probably a bit of overkill to describe this place. It's a big public space, with a tourism office, and Fran\u00e7ois-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lemot's impressive statue of King Louis XIV, who's neck, it seems, was almost as big as his horse's.",
          "It's really nice around the place, the really positive point is of the place is that it's difficult to find a free toilet in France but there is one in this place, and really clean and neat also. There are not many things to do in the place, but around it there is an amazing",
          "Lots of buses and a few metro lines go to Place Bellecour and it is a good point to aim for when looking for the main shopping streets and restaurants/bars",

          "Centre piece of Lyon , place to aim for via metro system as this is the hub of traveling around Lyon via metro connections to all other lines from here. Place is a huge square with plenty of cafes and surrounded by the main shopping areas of Lyon Central .",
          "We were a bit underwhelmed by the Place Bellecour. It was quite hot when we were there and all that red clay reminded us of the desert at home. The only reason to go there, in our opinion, was to visit the tourist information centre which we found to be very helpful. The statue",
          "Large and not a lot to see or do.Very close to the well known commercial street but don't miss the other side of the square for a shopping street that you can easily miss.",
          "With parking underneath and restaurants and bars nearby plus shopping in the square this is a great place to start in Lyon - good and high class shopping is nearby as well as those elegant boulevards that typify French cities",
          "Very big and open square with lot of restaurants, benches, tourist office. Very good for kids they have enough space to run and play",
          "Place Bellecour is a good starting point for touring Lyon. Large and vibrant pedestrian square is a connection point to embark either on the Vieux Lyon walk (just head into the direction of the Sa\u00f4ne, cross the bridge, and stroll along the embankment) or taking another direction",
          "Great space with a couple of terrace restaurants. This was our first stop after checking in - the tourist office is located on the corner of the plaza.",
          "Square is very large and empty there isn't anything on the square than one statue. You just can pass through it. There are so many better attractions in Lyon.",
          "This is apparently the largest pedestrian square in Europe. It is simply massive. There is a spectacular statue of Louis XIV in the centre and an art gallery at one end. When we visited, the square was deserted (mid-day and very hot!) so we were able to get a real perspective",
          "Place Bellacour is the main square in Lyon, however it is far from the prettiest! The tourist information centre is based here along with some of the more expensive hotels. There are shops nearby along with restaurants and cafe's. There is a metro station here too, so getting",
          "Place Belabour is huge. It is the true centre of Lyon and a cool place to sit and relax. There are a heap of shops surrounding the square and you can easily find food and clothing stores all around here.",
          "A massive square that holds a couple of big statues, an art gallery and the tourist information office. The third biggest square in France, its more of an empty square with barely no trees or benches at all. More like a cement desert, its a place that you will pass for sure...",
          "For a large square it was a bit under whelming, a few little modern shops near the info center & some little water features, for me it's not a destination spot, more a passing through one.",
          "Place Bellcour is walk through place to visit. It's not a place where you would spend the time but still it's a place to see. You can see the hills of Vieux Lyon and you can also find the tourist information here.",
          "One of the biggest squares in Europe apparently and it accommodates a lot of different events. When we were there a group of workers were on strike and making quite a racket. Just before we left Lyon they were setting up booths for different countries for some kind of",
          "I agree with other reviewers, this place has the ingredients to look pretty, and inviting, rather than just another few hundred feet to walk through to get to the other side. The lone useful spot for us was the more-helpful-than- average tourist info, where we bought Lyon Card",

          "If you're looking for a really really big slab of concrete with a statue in the middle, here it is. Sure, its big. but other than that, i didn't find anything spectacular about it. If you're in the neighbourhood, you may as well check it out.",

          "Our visit to Lyon was very impressive.It\u2019s the third largest city in France. We decided to stop over on our way to the airport for a return trip to Ireland. We got a pleasant surprise! Lyon with its 2 million inhabitants is the biggest French city we have visited since Paris.",

          "We're staying a few seconds from here so walk past all of the time. I keep looking for something to get excited about. So far....just a big empty space. I honestly expected, at the very least, a bunch of cafes with outdoor seating and some good people watching. I suppose",
          "In the very center of Lyon, is this huge square, but there is nothing to do here. No chairs, no grass. It's not pretty. There is one statue. The size is very impressive but overall it's boring. I suppose it's great for large events, christmas markets, make-shift shops, or",

          "I visited place Bellecour with a friend on a sunny afternoon. We sat in one of the Alfresco dining areas in the heart of the square and spent a great afternoon drinking and watching the locals cycle/walk by. I definitely recommend the house wine as cocktails were rather more",
          "This was one of the first attractions we went to in Lyon. Renault was having some kind of exhibition in the square. There were different kinds of trucks scattered along Rue de la R\u00e9publique as we walked toward the square. They also used chalk on the square of different areas",
          "Although it is very centrally located, the square itself is not particularly handsome. Rather, it has a kind of empty look, as if it is too large for itself. Of the various directions one can go in from here, we particularly liked the southern side, with its antique shops",

          "This is supposedly one of the biggest squares in Europe but it should also hold the title for one of the most boring. This vast expanse of concrete is a no-man's land with just a miserly statue in the middle. On one side, some old buildings and a handful of trees and plants have",

        "wiki": "The Mus\u00e9e des Confluences is a science centre and anthropology museum which opened on 20 December 2014 in the 2nd arrondissement of Lyon, (Rh\u00f4ne), France. It is located at the southern tip of the Presqu'\u00eele at the confluence of the Rh\u00f4ne and the Sa\u00f4ne, adjacent to Autoroute A7, and comprises part of a larger redevelopment project of the Confluence quarter of Lyon. The deconstructivist architectural design, said to resemble a floating crystal cloud of stainless steel and glass, was created by the Austrian firm Coop Himmelb(l)au.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe museum includes collections of natural science, anthropology, and Earth Sciences of the Mus\u00e9e d'histoire naturelle - Guimet. These collections will be supplemented by exhibitions of arts and crafts.\nThe four major exhibitions are called \"Origins - Stories of the World\", \"Species - the Web of life\", \"Societies - Human theatre,\" and \"Eternities - Visions of the beyond\". The first exhibition deals with questions of origin, both the Big Bang theory, history of the universe, as well as the birth of life and evolution of especially humans. The second exhibition, \"Species\", explores the links between humans and animals, and evolution of different species. The third exhibition, \"societies\" is about human societies and how humans build communities. And finally, \"Eternities\" deals with the meaning of life, the inevitable death of humans, and how that question has been dealt with in different societies.\nThe museum stands 44 m (144 ft) high, 150 m (492 ft) long, and 83 m (272 ft) wide. Total area will be 22,000 m\u00b2 (238,000 sq ft), 6,500 of which will be devoted to exhibitions, three times greater than the museum exhibition space. Nine concurrent exhibitions (4 permanent + 5 temporary), plus four discovery spaces and two auditoriums will be available. Construction cost was budgeted for \u20ac153 million, but the controversial final cost is now forecast to approach nearly \u20ac300 million\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in France\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site of the museum\nMus\u00e9e des Confluences on Mapolis\nMus\u00e9e des Confluence, on the site of Lyon",

          "Before you step through the doors you have your breath taken away by the building itself. Take time to walk around the outside & down to the point of the confluence. The extent of the permanent exhibits is amazing and the seasonal / travelling exhibitions we saw were just",
          "This museum is architecturally impressive and has some great philosophical content to absorb. Plenty of models, fossils and animals that are great for kids as well. Depending on your time frame you could spend half a day or more here to take everything in, but I spent an hour",

          "We visited this place in late November. The museum is housed in a modern building, the architecture itself is interesting to see. However, we did find the collection on display somewhat random. For example, they have one room dedicated to prison, which you can make visitor calls",
          "Impressive modern architecture that offers some great views on Lyon and its surroundings. There is a tram stop nearby, so you can take the public transport to reach this museum, which is situated somewhat out of the city center. You can also go by bike. It is a nice bike ride",
          "However on a fine day the surroundings are lovely and if you feel like the exercise there is a riverside walk back into town. Take about 1.5 hours. Interesting architecture along the quays.",
          "We have not visited Lyon for some years and did not know about this museum. It is wonderful. Really a most handsome structure, very well laid out. Both the interior and exterior are very architecturally interesting. There are splendid views. One nice thing is that it is easy to",
          "We weren't sure what to expect from this museum and we were totally enthralled by the concept. Its creativity and novel approach make a visit well worth the time and money. I loved seeing people of all ages being engaged in the exhibits and though technology is certainly on a",
          "This is a very modern museum which is well laid out and has good presentations. There are lifts and escalators to get around the building. There is a good viewing area at the top with a wacky roofline and a great caf\u00e9 with a good choice of food. There is also a nice shop.",
          "We spent hours here. Lived it. V interesting curatiin. For London visitors - it's a mix of all the hr natural history, science and V&A museums. Superb. The 'cafe' on the ground floor is a proper restaurant with prices accordingly lovely food and attentive service. Hence the top",
          "Very modern and superbly presented A mix of Natural History. Anthropology Global Awareness and fun Very highly recommended",
          "A spectacular building and superb exhibits make this one of our top destinations in Lyon. We saw the exhibit on headwear from all over the world and loved it! The permenant exhibit tries to answer the questions who are we, where did we come from and what's next; and does it in",
          "This stunning piece of modern architecture build at the confluence of the Rhone and the Saone Rivers, presents a contrast with the historical aspects of the city. Sitting like a spaceship, its inviting and provides a well presented collection of the history of man and and",
          "This was slightly disappointing, because it looks much larger that it is- a lot of useless corridors and empty spaces inside. Very modern architecture and some lovely views out over both the Rhone and Soane rivers. The displays were fantastic, especially on aboriginal culture,",
          "I am an Art historian, and have seen many museums. I am so delighted with this place: it is almost an answer to my wishes: multi-directional, art, sociology, ethology, architecture, philosophy. Sounds almost like a scary mixture, but it is not. The exhibits are very well",
          "One of the best museums I've ever visited (and I've visited quite many). Mus\u00e9e des Confluences combines natural history, art, ethnography, geography, antrophology, you name it. Permanent exhibitions are very interesting, and temporary exhibitions are like delicious cherries on",
          "Jaded gallery and museum visitors should take note! The Musee des Confluences in Lyon will restore your faith (and interest) in curated collections. With a perfect blend of Science, Natural History, Anthropology and Culture, housed in a truly Impressive contemporary building",
          "Despite its large size, there is surprisingly little in there but not too bad value for money. There are four permanent exhibitions and currently, three temporary. The app which is for an audio guide is not brilliant, there are numbered signs in the exhibitions but they don't",
          "This modern musee has both permanent and temporary exhibitions that are all well presented, informative - some with interactive aspects. Good for kids. I particularly enjoyed the temporary exhibition of head-dresses from around the world - a remarkable collection from a private",
          "We went to Confluence Shopping Center and Went to this museum by walking for 10-15 minutes. The building is very modern and impressive. You can see the whole new town from the top of this building. You will see all those modern buildings and housings. We had a drink in the",
          "The building is very impressive in design, modern in style. There are not that many things to see and whilst everything is very well presented, we were a little dissappointed.",
          "First impressions, arriving from the bridge, we\u2019re not good, but inside it is really interesting and gives very good views over the city, the confluence and the bridges. The best view of the building is from the confluence and it is worth walking as far as possible to see how",
          "The bulding itself is impressing.The garden and vues are very nice.Exebition was intrsting , shuld be more intresting for kids.",
          "When we travel we try and see everything we can. This museum happened to be very close to our hotel so we decided to go. Well worth the money. They had an Insect exhibit and an headdress exhibit. Both were very interesting.",
          "The museum itself whilst lovely plays second fiddle to the architecture around you. I would honest say head to the museum take the elevator and stairs to the rooftop terrace and spend some time up there viewing the two rivers of the confluence.",
          "The building is amazing but found the museum itself slightly boring. Advise walking through the confluence area to get there as the buildings are all different and interesting.",
          "My family and I were totally absorbed for hours taking in the exhibits. The section on the origins of life was *outstanding* and probably the best national history exhibition I have ever been to. The way the artefacts, science and films were put together was illuminating for",
          "The building itself is an impressive feat of modern architecture but if you're attracted to the rustic charm of the cobbled streets and bouchons of Lyon then this museum may feel a little sterile in comparison. The exhibitions within are certainly impressive in scope, detail",
          "One of my favorite museums in Lyon! They have some really cool exhibits, and I wish I could\u2019ve stayed there longer. 3 hours didn\u2019t feel like enough. It also has a garden with a nice view!",
          "A must on any visit to Lyon. We went on a wet morning in August expecting massive queues. There was a fairly short but quick queue for tickets but apart from that we felt no pressure from crowds, including the cafe. Amazing structure and several hands on exhibits. No need for an",
          "Take the Metro to the museum on a hot summer day for a fantastic experience. Enjoy the displays and then take time for lunch.",
          "We only visited the four permanent exhibits, take care to follow the map because the rooms are laid out strangely considering how you arrive and we ended up starting at the end... Anyway, a concise history of global evolution and societies, I felt like it wanted to make some",
          "Worth the visit. We did it on a wet day and it was ideal. Fascinating rooms and a really intriguing place.",
          "It\u2019s a nice and interesting place to visit, but only if you have time left in Lyon, after visiting the VieuxLyon and the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon. The entrance is free for students from all over the world between 18-26 years, and if you are under age is free too. I",
          "It's a bit out of the way but do go here. Its theme is all of life! It covers the natural world, human history, global civilisations, and the rooftop caf\u00e9 offers great views over both rivers.",
          "The fabulous Confluence of two rivers offers this marvel of architecture and its contents. The exhibits are stunning, the building is stunning, the location is stunning and even eating in the Bistro is, yes! stunning, do it, immerse, you will be so glad you did. Access is via",
          "on the confluence of the Rhone and the Shone river a mordern building with lot of learning oppurtunity.Also had the privilage to see the carcas of a prehistoric elephant like mammoth ,i think its called a Mastodon which was excavated from the same palce where the Museum stands.",
          "An incredible anthropology museum for all ages and individuals. There are two main levels, one of temporary exhibitions and one of permanent exhibits featuring four rooms on the second level involving the study of human cultures specifically on our origins, societies, species,",
          "This museum at the confluence of the 2 rivers cutting through Lyon, is an architectural marvel. The building alone is worth a visit. The permanent display houses an interesting philosophical analysis of the relationship mankind with death, the planet and culture. Fascinating",
          "It\u2019s a fairly average museum without particularly compelling exhibits. The architecture is impressive and there are outstanding views of the rivers.",
          "A trip to Lyon must include a visit to this unique architectural masterpiece. The building itself is such a visual delight enhanced by its location where the 2 rivers join. There are a number of permanent and temporary exhibitions that are available for viewing. Plan to spend",
          "We drove by this Musee and were amazed by the architecture of the building. Unfortunately due to the length of our stay we did not have time to return and explore, it will definitely be on our list of places to visit next time.",
          "The building and the location are stars here. There is a beautiful park below the building itself where the Rh\u00f4ne and Saone rivers come together. The exhibits are very interesting and well documented in English and French. The building is an incredible example of current",
          "To get here, take the little vaporetto which runs down the Saone to the Confluence area and then the number 1 tram or walk for ten minutes. The building is an impressive soaring design mixing spaceship with opera house and reminds you of the Guggenheim in Bilbao. The exhibits",
          "A recent reviewer said that you had to climb stairs to get to the Top level cafe. Not true. We were there today and caught the lift up. He also said although he did not pay the entry fee, the exhibits appeared geared towards children. How would he know if he didn't see the",
          "The exhibits seemed geared for the youngsters. We opted out of paying the entrance fee, but were allowed to wander up the impressive building. The Cafe is at the very top and accessible only via the stairs. The climb is good exercise, but not in the summer heat. Extremely",
          "Housed in a structure that is an architectural work of art, the permanent collection here follows the earth\u2019s evolution, including human evolution, in a totally immersive way. We went on a day filled with school excursions and the children were as rapt as us adults. The building",
          "This museum kept me engaged for 5 hours plus. The permanent exhibition is great and I also enjoyed the more temporary exhibits as well. It's hard to say or classify this museum but the best explanation I heard was it explores mankind great questions. Where do we come from?",
          "This new and modern museum has not only changed the face of the city, but also provides great information in the form of several museums ver professionally. It is also located where the two rivers of Lyon meet!",
          "Great museum with a large collection of artefacts. It's mostly a natural history museum, well-designed for children and adults alike, with interesting temporary exhibitions.",
          "This very modern museum is located where the river Rhone and Sarone meets. It is a great modern architecture designed by an Austrian architect. The permanent exhibition in the second floor is very well done. You can reach it easily via tram line 1.",
          "At the end of 4 days in Lyon, I was determined to add to the multitude of places visited (care of a 3-day Lyon Card), a visit to the spectacular Musee des Confluences, in the building reminiscent of the wimple of 'The Flying Nun' and an ominous Space Fighter! At the confluence",
          "This museums stands out as it is so unique in his architecture, lots to see. Take your time. Nearby, on the edge of the river, are a row of modern, architectural interesting buildings in strong colours.",
          "Stopped here on a rainy day when we were in Lyon, perfect rainy day activity. The atrium is stunning, you can really appreciate the architecture from here. There is a walkway that goes from one level to another in the atrium and that was a highlight for me. Stunning views",
          "The building is incredible! They have a great mix of temporary and permanent exhibitions which makes the visit attractive.",
          "Interesting museum with both permanent and temporary exhibitions , well worth a visit because of its architecture and the beautiful views from its rooftop over Lyon, Rhone and Saone rivers.",
          "In the Confluence museum, we only had time to visit two rooms in the top floor, popular science exhibitions on evolution and biology. A quick look at the others were of mild interest to us.",
          "one of the best museums I've ever been to. At first appearance a little random, but the exhibits presented are structured in a way that makes sense and transmits the narrative in a way that is understandable across the generations.",
          "Walk around the outside of this architecture marvel, see all the buildings nearby...but don't waste your money going inside this ho-hum museum.",
          "We spent a couple of hours here during our visit to Lyon, with the admission being included in the cost of the Lyon City Card. This is more of an exhibition space than a museum, but we enjoyed visiting the different areas- English translations on every exhibit. There is a",
          "High quality exhibitions, very instructive path from the first life on earth to the present times. Help you to understand how precious is life on our planet and how clever it is !",
          "Very smartly displayed, lots of interactive screens that help explain in children-friendly language several of the exhibits and mankind developments. And, on top of the great interior, it's just an amazing structure that really makes a difference in the landscape. Brilliant. 9\u20ac",
          "The museum is one thing to see but the area itself is the star. Basically you can not build a building in the Confluence area unless it is unusual. On Sunday when almost everything is closed people are walking all over the area just looking at the various buildings, you can't",
          "I had done no research on this museum and had no idea what the theme was (I vaguely thought it might be dedicated to the history of Lyon) but our hotel receptionist highly recommended it so we checked it out. And, we are so glad we did! Both the permanent and temporary",
          "Very interesting blend of natural history paired with social and political history - well done. Take the water ferry from the center of Lyon - you'll get another view of the City and dropped off relatively close to the museum. You'll still have a stroll but its worth the ride",
          "A variety of interesting exhibitions in a beautiful building just where the rivers Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne join together. Great also for kids at all ages. We have enjoyed an exhibition of African sculptures and another of Japanese spirits and divinities.",
          "The dominance of the museum on the confluence underlies its importance and the influence of science.",
          "We did not visit the regular galleries, but saw the two special exhibits, one on the Kalash people of Pakistan/Afghanistan and on the Japanese masks called \"Yokainoshima, esprits du Japon.\" I am a museum junkie, and visited about ten museums in Lyon (which is why I didn't have",
          "The architecture is beautiful and anyone that likes taking photographs of modern buildings will enjoy here. We didn\u2019t stay for as long as I think we should however this building holds some great exhibitions and it is worth the \u20ac5 entrance. If you don\u2019t fancy paying to explore",
          "Modern museum at confluence of rivers, excellent presentation with very good literature and details. The theme is different and nicely maintained, good for young children for understanding human development and different cultures. Building architecture is quite different & some",
          "Must see while here. Best museum I have ever been. Plenty to see and do. Great gift shop. Great views from the roof",
          "The Musee des Confluences is not to be missed for both its architecture and broad array of exhibits, which cover the wide spectrum of human and animal life. Of particular interest was the display and explanation of funerary rites throughout history and across many cultures, as",
          "Very modern architecture built where Lion's two rivers come together. Temporary exhibitions are attractive and nicely presented.",
          "What better way to travel to a museum but on a boat from the excellent market along the banks of the Sa\u00f4ne. Trouble is when you reach the Museum you are assailed by a steel and glass monstrosity with a vast windy, concreted undercourse with utterly useless square puddles that",
          "I went here for a special exhibition on the Japanese spiritual world. It was very busy. So success for the museum. But the many people, given the lack of space, didn't help to see all the exhibits well. All these exhibits are of course aesthetically beautiful, but the spiritual",
          "Since other reviews talk amply of the excellent exhibits, let's consider in the pics here the striking exterior and interior of this museum devoted to..... Creation And Eternity (my summary, not theirs). This area of Lyons is a marked departure from the old stone and timber of",
          "This is a striking modern building. Excellent exhibition on the top floor of the history of existence from the big bang to the present, with recognition of the broad ranges of human cultures. It's an important contrast to the absurd Arc \"museum\" in Kentucky.",
          "The museum advised that there was a section suitable for children. There is nothing for them to touch or 'experience' - one of the two rooms suitable for children consists of hundreds of taxidermy animals. While it is interesting, it definitely isn't something you take a younger",
          "An excellent natural history museum & anthropology displays with lots to offer for non-French speakers. The mammoth was impressive and the kids loved the digital information displays. Kids are free but still need a ticket. Well worth a visit.",
          "I have been quite impressed by the overall quality of the exhibitions, the in-depth, comprehensive and thought-provoking examination of our society, our history and nature. I could only say, kids in Lyon are quite blessed and privileged with museums of this standard. It is",
          "Part science museum, part natural history, part philosophical experience. A true gem of a museum - truly world class.",
          "I didn't actually enter the building however the area surrounding it is very interesting as well as it being an architecturely great building.",
          "To tell the truth, we came for a cultural event, so can't address the actual museum. But the setting - at the confluence of the Rhone and Sa\u00f4ne Rivers - is spectacular, and the architecture dramatic. You can get here by the modern tramway from the center of Lyon.",
          "Unusual architecture for an unusual museum. Exhibits were not as focused as I am used to in American museums, but I found interesting things in every room even when I wasn't sure what tied one room to the other.",
          "Here on a dreary , wet and dull day but this museum succeeded in cheering me up! It has a rapidly changing exhibition space which is spread out over three floors. The exhibition spaces are divided into huge rooms, beautifully arranged and brilliantly lit with lots of exciting",
          "A very nice idea to expose the history of our existence. Very well structures, in chapters, in order to be easier the interpretation. Four units, but the last, was a surprise for me. Finally, despite the fact that we know many things, when someone is sharing with us",
          "A little out of the way, we needed to take a Metro and then the Tramway (with a little disrupted service due to demonstrations) we finally made it to the museum. The markings on the outside of the handicapped entrance were not readily seen. I went to the door and spoke with a",
          "Very beautiful museum... The temporary expositions from Hugo Pratz and Himalayas were great and so were the others... The arquitecture of the museum is something fantastic and its location and views to the city are very nice...",
          "This one was top of my list and I was not disappointed. I even downloaded their app which sadly is not that easy to use. My daughter and I visited the permanent exhibitions. I particularly loved the origins section, from the first human beings, the different species, and very",
          "Definitely do not go on a weekend! So crowded there were lines for every exhibit. The small restaurant was fully booked so we were forced to eat in the tiny cafeteria where you heat your own food in a microwave and it was so tiny we had to wait in line for quite a while.",
          "Spectacular modern building at the confluence of the Rh\u00f4ne and the Sa\u00f4ne with a great view from the upper floors. Three current (Nov 2018) exhibitions are very interesting especially the Pratt and the Kalabash. The permanent exhibits explore the relationship of man and nature.",
          "When you plan to visit the museum during weekend or a high-season it's good to book your tickets online - it will save you time waiting in the queue. Inside the permanent and temporary exhibitions will be interesting for both adults and children. A great view of the whole city",
          "This museum is in line with the best ones in the world NYC and London,Smart displays of nature and artifacts. Free app as well. nice views from the cafe on top",
          "This is a very modern building with unusual architectural features. Inside there are temporary and permanent exhibitions of various kinds as well as views over the confluence of the Rhone and the Saone. We visited on a public holiday and it was very crowded with families. The 2",
          "Go there for the location and the building in a day with good weather to appreciate the landscape. Do not expect to visit a museum with interesting permanent collection. The museum instead hosts temporary exposition that are worthwhile.",
          "I usually avoid natural history museums because they are such a snooze: a bunch of bones, a few dioramas, a lot of Latin names on tags. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Therefore, we thought we would just have a look at the outside of the spectacular-looking new spaceship-like building at",
          "A stunning building and a masterpiece of modern French steeel and glass architecture. Disappointed that there were not internal exhibits more associated with the two rivers and a permanent record of the importance of the confluence",
          "While it was very interesting, it\u2019s also a bit of a puzzle. I read about it ahead of visiting. It\u2019s very accessible and quite logical. It\u2019s not easy to understand how or why some exhibits are in and others aren\u2019t. It\u2019s impossible to to capture everything, I guess. Came away",
          "The museum is a new landmark for Lyon. You love it or you hate it. I love the shape of the building. You can enter for free and visit the museum shop at the ground floor and the terrace on the top floor. From the terrace you have a nice view on the river (Rh\u00f4ne). For the",
          "I was very ho-hum about visiting another European museum, but this one really blew me away. Of course the exterior is spectacular, but the way the exhibitions are visually presented was so interesting. When we entered the museum, a very helpful young man approached us with a",
          "This museum can be recommended. Exhibition was well organized and very modern Building itself is also worth of seeing",
          "This is one of the best museums I have visited. There a number of themed galleries Evolution, Society etc. What is really good is the way the artefacts are used to get across a number of themes and messages. You never have the feeling that there are too many things to take in",
          "This museum is clearly worth a visit. The building itself is very interesting and beautifully set (as the name implies) at a river junction. Having visited a lot of museums worldwide were you soon get sensory overloaded, the way the exhibits were presented here made us go",
          "I visited this over Heritage weekend when it was free. I'm not sure what I expected. I was told that as I was interested in environment and ecology this was a must. It took mankind through the ages to the ravages, I guess of endangered flora and fauna. Very interesting",
          "This unfortunately named museum is worth a trip to Lyon to see. It is Actually a museum of anthropology starting with the creation of the universe and working it's way through human development up through modern times. We left 1.5 hours to visit this massive presentation but",
          "The building is stunning. There are lots of rooms with themed exhibitions. We visited all the exhibitions that were open and it was interesting. There were artefacts but it\u2019s not the sort of museum that houses lots of paintings. Sculptures and relics more themed on the human",
          "Stunning building. Fabulous views up the river to the town. Exhibits were fascinating. Well worth a visit",
          "The building is striking but doesn't quite keep the promise it makes from the outside. The best views from the inside are from the staircases and from a small viewing platform on the top. The caf\u00e9's terrace doesn't really have a view. Still, the museum is worth a visit from an",
          "I liked the unique concept of the permanent exhibition. A nice break of the classical dusty collections. Multisensual experience. What kid (or grown nerd) doesn't want to touch Dinosaur fossils",
          "There is a permanent expo and temporary, the latter of higher interest being always well done and written. Although some texts are only available in French. I took my teen daughter here 3-4 times and every time you spend 2-3 great hours discovering a new theme. They had a great",
          "Great museum with a extensive range of exhibits! They have a temporary section and a permanent one, as well! 2 floors of rooms with different themes, and areas where you can touch fossils and skeletons, which is great for the kids and not only! Audio in English on some areas, as",
          "The exhibitions in this place are quite quirky.....there's a theme at each hall but the theme doesn't necessarily carry through...so you get dinosaur bones next to Japanese whacky art or the first Nokia phone and a food mixer. The building though is amazing! Apparently it's",
          "This was a rainy day activity. A very contemporary design in concrete & glass. Exhibits were ok but not a must see. The exhibit on death was sort of a downer. Nostalgic visit in the exhibit on technology from the late 1800s to today for those of us a certain age. The building",
          "This museum has an interesting construction which I suspect would be quite polarising but I quite liked it. I only did the permanent exhibition which covered themes like eternity, species, society and origins. I liked the eternity one but the others I thought were a touch",
          "Modern structure Is dominated area of two rivres confluence. Nice bridge Is near by. For modern architecture lovers Is perfect area!",
          "Beautiful setting where the Soane and Rh\u00f4ne rivers meet. Great exhibits. Visit the nearby modern buildings and shopping center. Incredible architecture",
          "The building is beautiful and the exhibitions are carefully designed. You get a glimpse of life on earth with nice pictures, movies and archeological foundings. The restaurant is on a beautiful location at the top of the building, but not very good. It looks like a highway fast",
          "Undoubtedly housed in a very modern building - think Guggenheim in Bilbao with lots of aluminium cladding - this museum was intriguing in terms of the collection and the way they were presented. As I remember it, we started with somerepresentations of stone-age family with lots",
          "In my opinion, the best museum in Lyon, can't believe it isn't higher up on the list of TripAdvisor. Beautiful, modern building with inside fascinating temporary expositions and a great collection of permanent rooms. The museum is set up in a very unique, educative way that",

          "We went on our last day before getting a late train. We left needing to come back to see the rest after 3 + hours. Probably take a whole day to really experience it all. This is a good example of a well curated modern museum with great use of technology. Download and use the",
          "Free for students! Worth a visit and the location is wonderfull, where the two rivers meet! Really enjoyed it!",
          "Really cool space with a good number of well organised exhibitions. Not overwhelming and good variety of things to see. Not too expensive either and price includes all special exhibits. Great place to escape the weather and learn about something.",

          "Lots of great exhibits going on. They a good permanent exhibit and interesting rotating ones. Easy to navigate and get through.",
          "The building is impressive, and can be reached fairly easily by streetcar or a not-overly long walk from the centre of town. But if you are hoping to learn anything about France, the Rhone, the Soane, or Lyon, you will be out of luck. It is a work of starchitecture, detached",
          "As many people living in Lyon, I was first against this new museum. The price of the building, 3 time higher at the end, the very strange look etc... Then, i went several time to visit with my gran children. I discover the place with their eyes. The pleasure they have is in the",

          "The building is dramatic and the temporary exhibitions were interesting but I found the permanent exhibition a bit predictable tho probably fine for local kids.",

          "Situated on the confluence of the Rhone and the Sa\u00f4ne,this museum is a must-see in Lyon , especially the Hugo Pratt temporary collection.",
          "Did not look at the collection, but the building and site alone are worth a visit...not to mention the Tony Garnier site",
          "Fantastic piece of design . I call it the star ship. Cant miss it as it is on the confluence of the Rhone and Soane rivers. The Museum itself has some really good and interesting things to see. You will have to find out yourself.",
          "It is worth going around this unique construction from the outside as both the Rh\u00f4ne and the Sa\u00f4ne join at this very spot. You then can enter the building and discover the permanent and the temporary exhibitions ; a lot of space to move about and a visit for all the family. I",
          "Plenty to see but it was rather spaced -out and wasn't as 'hands-on' as we had hoped. Our three girls ( 12,11,9) spent a couple of hours here, but, to be honest, I was a little disappointed with it.",
          "Beautifully presented themed exhibitions in the permanent collection with some good temporary ones. Great views from the room terrace bar",
          "It is a unique museum. A very successful - to some extent because oits unique site - deconstructive architecture, and a very interesting and extremely well presented collection. A very happy combination indeed.",
          "This is a spectacular building with great exhibitions. We didn't really do the museum justice as we didn't have enough time to see all of the exhibits but very much enjoyed the architecture - fascinating.",
          "Visited on a rainy morning and was astounded by how long we were there.Very interesting exhibits and themes,but probably not good for young children.Rooftop Caf\u00e9 was not good,long queue,expensive and poor food.If you have a Eurostar ticket you will get two for one admission to",
          "It was ok. I wouldn\u2019t travel all the way to go and see it. Interesting building. Not much to see and do other than look at the modern design.",
          "Visited here on a last day in Lyon. Everything else had been very positive but unfortunately the museum inside was sadly unwelming exhibits lacked continuity",
          "Spent a number of hours on a rainy day in this architectural gem of a building. Confluences refers to the location of the museum on the confluence of the Rhone and the Saone rivers. At its most basic and ambitious goal, the museum deals with the story of mankind and how",
          "A totally different kind of museum. Organised by themes and housed in an amazing modern building. The rooftop cafe is a bonus. Admission free with a Lyon card.",
          "Impressive building and impressive museum. Worth visiting but you need time. The ticket was 9\u20ac and it took us 2 hours to visit the two floors and every hall of the museum. There were exhibits about death, prehistoric animals, technological development, astronomy and many other",
          "Go to this museum as soon as you get to Lyon. There is a ferry boat that will take you there for 2 euros. The museum is a work of art, not only the art inside but the architecture, lighting and more. If you can visit it at night too.",
          "We wereadvised to allow at least 4 hours. We could only spare 2.5 and were really rushed. A fantastic museum with something for all ages. Will definately return. Priority access was granted with our City Cards. A boon given the queues on a rainy day.",
          "It's good to dedicate about 3h to visit the museum + the beautiful park outside. It offers a great view of both rivers in Lyon and the great opportunity to learn about humankind. Great visit!",
          "We spent half a day at the confluence museum and it was vey interesting we a Touaregs exhibition and also one of Hugo Pratt super exhibit of his works. Also there is 4 permanents exhibits about the origin and evolution of the world. We had a quick lunch at the cafeteria the view",
          "Of course it will polarise opinion - we loved it. Full of interest and loved the vortex. Also liked seeing the confluence of the rivers - the colour of each as they meet clearly visible. A long way down from all of the main attractions, so worth jumping the tram for a couple of",
          "This building is a very poor relation of Bilbao's Guggenheim. I have walked round and round it and it doesn't work from any angle. However inside it is a treasure house of cultural and natural diversity with some unusual themes - like death and people's ideas of the hereafter -",
          "The building and it's location is impressive. We saw a temporary exhibit on cinema and the Lumiere Brothers which was interesting. The rest of the museum is about science and evolution. Lots of animal skeletons and animal reproductions. Don't miss the rooftop terrace.",
          "We were a little disappointed with the museum. The staff were great and could hardly have been more helpful once we got inside the building. We had some difficulties finding the entrance due to confusing signage. The permanent collection offered some interesting displays of",
          "Great building . Odd museum. I would not visit a second time. It tried to cover a lot of topics. The poison one was interesting . The others were so memorable I cannot remember what they were about. A few Dinosaurs etc",
          "I wasn't quite sure what to expect as the museum aims to be so eclectic. Although many of the exhibits are the normal stuff you'd expect (still interesting), the Poison exhibition was fascinating, while seeing bits of meteors and old technology was simply mind-blowing. I was",
          "A must see in Lyon. Beautiful building with exciting architecture. Perfect location at the point where Rhone and Sa\u00f4ne meet. Very interesting permanent collection.",
          "The rooms are arranged by theme, not period, so it makes it different from the usual suspects and an true experience. it is designed to think about where we come from and where we want to go.It explores the possibilities of life. And there\u00b4s a roof top terrance and restaurant.",
          "We found the museum to be very interesting with well though out and presented static displays. Definitely worth a visit when in Lyon",
          "The 2 rivers of Lyon meet at this point. One can walk all the way to the point where they actually meet. Occasionally some swans r also seen. The museum is also a architectural marvel with a very unique shape. Must visit place if you are in Lyon.",
          "The collections were good, too, but the lighting was difficult in some rooms. The views over the flooding Saone and the Rhone Rivers was impressive.",
          "First time in a museum where I could see, at the same time: original items from Lumi\u00e8re brothers, a Black Widow specimen and all sorts of technology. Unmissable museum!",
          "\u0130t s really best museum for us newly built and designed especially stands and showplaces . Possible to see all the stages of humanbeings , animals, cinema, art , mechanic and technic inventions etc....",
          "Visited this new museum at the end of December, enjoyed it very much. There are a number of rooms so with fixed displays and others which feature special themed short term exhibits and of which were very interesting, most items on display are labelled in both French and English,",
          "The exterior is not the only thing you'll remember after your visit. The place offers not only some nice spots to sit or walk near the river but also a fantastic exhibition inside which can take up to 3 hours to see entirely. And you won't notice when the time has passed so",
          "A must see new museum in the city. The architecture of the building itself is a shiwstopper and the exibits are most interesting.",
          "The building itself is a must-see. Quite incredible and imaginative architecture. Parking was easy in January and just a 5 minute stroll away. The museums permanent and temporary displays are separated into a variety of large rooms and are interesting and really well put",
          "I can't remember last time I had so much fun in a museum, which I normally hate. This w.e in particular there was an exhibition on poisons and venoms which was absolutely fascinating. Easy to walk around, park, nice bar and restaurant available and a great view of the city.",
          "If there is just one museum that you would like to visit on a trip to Lyon, make it this one. It is set at the tip of the island where the two rivers meet hence the name. The building itself is a piece of architectural delight. The space, the light and the views are fascinating.",
          "The museum at the confluence of the Saone and the Rhone has some excellent exhibits a bit like the Smithsonian or a combined natural history science and v and a museums but with a gallic approach. Excellent lighting and signing in French and English.",
          "Situated as it's name suggests were the two rivers meet. It's a beautiful setting and a spectacular building. Inside it has permanent and temporary exhibitions which are truly intriguing . I found the lighting a little off putting at times . Unfortunately this was aggivated by",
          "Since a long time I wanted to visit this museum visible from the highway which pass in the center of Lyon, and I was not disappointed. The collection is rich, original and accessible to the kids. I really like the temporary exhibition about the Touareg and the Frere Lumiere.",
          "The architecture of the museum is so obviously different and, to some extent, challenging to come to terms with. But just to move between the rooms, to enter the cafe at the very top and to 'brave' the vision point is an experience in itself. Then, additionally, to tour the",
          "Large building at the end of the peninsula area of central Lyon and dominating the point of confluence. The building in itself is not handsome but explains how the meeting point of the Rh\u00f4ne and Siane has dominated the development of Lyon.",
          "Wow what an amazing museum, showing the history and development of humans throughout the world. The rooftop is a great to get an amazing view over the city. And the exhibitions were really informative.",
          "Good place but for a not french it's very difficult to understand all intereactive places....and more with children. Some translations are not very good ( is 1864 the 18th century???) and so on.... Nice views, nice arquitecture...but need some care and maintenance about this",
          "we found very interesting all the exhibiton, it is better to take a ticket for the big tour of the museum. On the top you will find a beautiful view and a snack bar.",
          "How life began. It's all here wonderfully presented. Also enjoyed the Lumiere cinematography exhibition. Nice views from bistro on top floor.",
          "This place is kind of a paradox. I will absolutely recommend seeing and visiting the building, the architecture is stunning and the view from the terrace on the roof has to be seen. But this is a museum as well, and there are many reasons why you shouldn't visit this museum.",
          "An unmissable museum for the building alone. Huge metal and glass building with a silver tiled roof sits at the confluence of the two rivers that run through Lyon.Filled with light and views of the rivers through the glass windows.",
          "We didn't go into the museum, but it was worth the walk from town just to see the building. If you are walking there I recommend you walk there alongside the left bank of the Rhone, and then back to town along the left bank of the Saone.",
          "I don\u2019t remember if I ever visited museum like it. The building looked like a huge metallic cloud in banks of rivers. Collection is very diversified, mixed with animals, alive or stuffed, plants, fossils, retro objects or funerals masks. As you see, we can think there isn\u2019t any",
          "Although tramline T1 will assure easy access to this part of Lyon, going here on a Monday will add some disappointment to your visit, as both the museum and the brasserie are closed...",
          "This is no a giant museum but the presentation in the permanent exhibits are beautifully presented in a unique building where the two rivers meet in southern Lyon. I thought the prehistoric fossils were wonderfully done with some skulls available to touch and feel. A lot of",
          "Stunning building worth seeing as much on the outside as what is on the inside. Internal layout and exhibits make for a interesting visit. Fortunate to visit one Sunday when entrance was free.",
          "A must visit for both the architecture and exhibitions that bring together 3 legacy museums at the point where the rivers meet.",
          "This is such a clever blend of artifacts, information and interactive displays. I absolutely loved it.",
          "We visited this lovely museum and it was free of charge for students under 26. For example the exhibition \"venenum\" was exciting and it's definitely worth of a visit.",
          "If you are interested in museums (natural and social history) and you appreciate modern architecture then you will find this place worth visiting. We spent over four hours here with our children (9&12). The exhibits were really well displayed and fascinating. The building itself",
          "We went to this museum mostly because we were curious about its architecture. The exhibitions turned out to be unusually well thought through. The confluence is the meeting of the two rivers in Lyon, where the museum is situated. From the roof of the museum you get spectacular",
          "This certainly is worth the trip out, either by boat or metro/tram. Very unique architecture, a great view of the two rivers merging, and interesting permanent and rotating exhibits. The current cinema (Lumiere), and poison, temporary exhibits are each worth the cost of",
          "This was such a welcome surprise. From its exterior I was expecting something very different than what I got. The museum is filled with beautifully and thoughtfully curated pieces around specific themes. Both the permanent and temporary exhibitions were so interesting and well",
          "How can that be?!! Closed every single Monday of the year!!! They\u2019ve spent a fortune of taxpayers money in design and size to create this stunning museum \u201cfrom the outside\u201d. I love mankind museums. We organised our visit to Lyon around visiting this museum. The only mistake",
          "We visited this place on a Sunday and found that admittance was free for all. The world and Lumiere exhibitions therein were both interesting and awesome. A visit there is a must.",
          "Try visiting Lyon and the new Coop [h]immelblau designed museum with a dozen architects, you'll get a dozen opinions on that. These days every city wants a Bilbao- type attraction and Lyon is no exception. Looking like a war-damaged mother ship from a Star Wars film, the",
          "You are sure of one thing when you start in that \"museum\" for the first time: it's that you do not know at all for what purpose it was built. Neither the panels, nor the notices you read, her or there, have helped you to understand one thing about it. It's by practicing",
          "Forming part of the striking modern architecture at the end of the presqu'isle, this is an impressive building. Entry is free with the Lyoncard and it is open until 10 pm on Thursdays. It appears to be basically a natural history cum anthropology museum. As well as the",
          "We saw this building from the hop-on hop-off bus and were blown away. I thought it must have been a Frank Gehry but we found out the architects were an Austrian Company. The deign and irregular shapes were brilliant and it is worth a visit for that alone. Unfortunately, the",
          "I spent an entire afternoon here, and could have been even longer. Fantastic combination of humanity and science. My personal favourite was the \"venenum\" exhibition on poisons.",
          "Marvellous architecture of the museum - huge location at the end of the 'confluence' in Lyon. It really is a prestige project and certainly worth a visit. The temporary exhibiton (Lumi\u00e8re cinema) as well as the permanent exhibition are very interesting.",
          "Musee de Confluance is the latest public prestige project in Lyon. Situated on a prime spot at the confluence of the Saone and the Rhone. The building was designed by famous Austrian Architect Firm Himmelblau. Everything is a question of taste, but this building is, to state it",
          "A pleasant tram ride to the confluence of the Rhine and Saone. Great building. To us a slightly odd collection of objects themed around Species, Society etc. Temporary exhibition on the development of French cinema and the Lumierre brothers is really good.",
          "This is really worth visiting whilst in Lyon. There is the permanent section which covers pretty well from the start of the world till today - extremely well done and fascinating. Then on another floor there was the temporary exhibition, so changes from time to time. It was all",
          "The permanent exhibition of the family Lumieire was fascinating historically and scientifically and how their work helped record images from all over the world at the turn of the last (19th to 20th) century. The temporary exhibitions of the history of poisons was interesting",
          "Couldn't put it better than LyndaMB on August 9,2017. It is muddled, interesting exterior, boring corporate interior; interesting grand themes, but the things chosen in the exhibits, while quite interesting, seem a bit random. I was disappointed because I saw the building under",
          "We visited this Museum, it was very worthwhile. Spent 3 hours, but could have spent more, probably 5-6 hour time allotment. Take the hop on hop off bus tour for two days and make this a stop.",
          "Interesting and diverse displays. One on cinema, one on snakes and venom, mummified cats! Beautiful architecture and view of the rivers merging.",
          "Not the usual kind of museum. The building itself is modern and contemporary and a work of art, on of its own. The exhibits are curious and interesting such as the one on death and the afterlife for instance. The evolution of technology, also so interesting. I also loved the",
          "Great Musee in the south of the city and a great day trip! However getting there is interesting. We thought we could take the metro for half of it and then walk it. The walk portion of our adventure put us in a seedy party of town with prostitutes on blocks and pimps watching us",
          "In a greatly designed building, we enjoyed everything but particularly the discussions on the changing concepts of death and on the history of poison. Don't forget to have a (so-so) coffee in the 4th floor cafeteria. The view is worth the not-so-good coffee.",
          "Simply wow!!!! Great esperienze! Great location! Great exhibitions! Great architecture! Great restaurant! We really enjoied!",
          "The thrilling aspects are the meeting of the two rivers and the view from the top of the building. The architecture is interesting from the outside, boring and corporate on the inside. It's a pity there is nothing about the rivers in the museum or indeed about any aspect of the",
          "This quite new museum sits at the point the Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne meet and is easily accessible by tram. Entry was \u20ac9.50. The building is modern steel and glass and is interesting in itself. Take the escalator to the top and there are 4 rooms charting the development of civilisations.",
          "Coop Himmelb(l)au architects have produced great works in Vienna and elsewhere but this is not one of them... Unfortunately the contents inside are displayed in a way that reflect the chaotic outside. Not convincing!",
          "In the super-modern building very old-fashioned curiosities collections re-arranged. Fascinating perspective of culture and civilisations. Absolute must if in Lyon.",
          "This very new museum is truely worth a visit. You can visit for the architecture or the exhibitions - or both. You may like the architecture or not but either way it is interesting. The exhibitions consist of a permanent part that tells the history of the universe and its",
          "This was our first visit on the list of many attractions Lyon City crds offers. We wish we have had more time to spend. Permanent exhibition of the development of the mankind is modern and concise. \"Poison\" exhibition is worth seeing. There is a very long list of credits",
          "I had an enjoyable time here it is quite interesting place to stroll through . Quite different to museums that I have visited before . A change from traditional older ones",
          "La Musee des Confluences is an interesting building in itself with good views from the top. The cafes are accessible without a ticket. They have an interesting permanent exhibition and very good temporary ones. Currently the exhibition about the Lumiere Brothers and film is",
          "We only had a few hours to enjoy this wonderful place - so opted to explore the building itself, the gardens, and then Floor 3 only. It really is spectacular - a flight of glass and steel, with wonderful views fro every direction. Decent place for coffee on the top floor with an",
          "Temporary exhibitions on Lumiere family and poisons were really excellent. I was not impressed by permament exhibition afterthen very much but the whole building has an awesome location and is well worth a visit.",
          "Fascinating deconstructive architecture at the meeting place of the rivers Saone and Rhone. Attractive exhibition(s) featuring the development of mankind and more.",
          "We only visited briefly but this building looked as thou it had originated from another planet! We need more time in Lyon.",
          "Amazing museum, both for architecture and exhibitions. If you are truly up to your eyeballs with Rubens, Rodin & Monet then this place will be a welcome respite. It has exhibitions to intrigue the intellectual and a splash of dinosaurs and the like to barter off with the",
          "This review deals only with the building and the location, as the museum was closed when we were there. The modern architecture looks like a giant space ship setting down on the confluence of the Rhone and Saone Rivers. Stunning building and site. Can;t wait to go back to see",
          "Designed by an Austran architect this building is a sight in itself. Supposed to represent a cloud, featuring the two hills of Lyon, this silver metallic and glass structure looks more like an alien mother ship but looks great at the point where the Sa\u00f4ne river flows into the",
          "If you're in Lyon for a few days then you should definitely give this museum a visit! Both temporary and permanent exhibitions were extremely interesting and very interactive, perfect for people of all ages! Plus, entry is free for students with a student ID card.",
          "Interested amd interactive museum experience. It was easy to spend over 3 hours browsing the various exhibits. Wonderful way to spend a wet afternoon.",
          "We originally met Dennis and Michel at their B&B in Lyon . Having enjoyed that we followed them when they moved to Carcassonne and we were not disappointed . The B&B is great as is Carcassonne.They treated us like family , the house is lovely as is the garden We will be back",
          "Like many other museums, the building is more spectacular than the exhibits it contains, still worth a look, and good for kids. You can park for free in the nearby shopping centre, just spend 20eu in Carrefour or have lunch there, then walk about 10 mins to the museum.",
          "We went to see this museum more for the architecture than for the exhibits but found the exhibits to very well done. It's easy to get to by taking the A Metro and T1 Tram and has a great view of the confluence of the Rhone and Saone Rivers. A perfect thing to do if the weather",
          "Recently opened, this museum is really terrific. From the outside, it suggests a futuristic dinosaur, or maybe a ship, metallic, angular but also swooping, sailing along and uniting the two rivers. You can see it also from several vantage points as you move around the city (a",

Headed up to the roof to orientate ourselves and admire the meeting of the rivers and some interesting",
          "Smashing building, worth a visit for just that. Easy to get to, tram stops at door. \u20ac9 per adult. Permanent exhibitions full of interesting artefacts, presented in interesting and informative ways. But only two temporary exhibitions meant unused space, and a sense of being",
          "Great architecture and interesting exhibitions. I liked to walk by the animals in 1:1size this getting a feel for their real size.",
          "The building is set on the confluence of two rivers. It is a very futuristic piece of architecture. Inside it seems very bleak with corridors which have almost \"hidden\" entrances till you get right up to them. I wish we had been given more time as 45 minutes was far too short",
          "The museum was wonderful with the exhibits set up to be enjoyed by both children and adults. Everything was bilingual. The permanent exhibits were in 4 rooms covering the origins the world, species and the web off life, societies and how they work together and finally eternities",
          "One has to see this museum which has the Rhone River on one side and the Saone on the other. Very modern with both permanent and temporary exhibtions. The one I enjoyed were artifacts that had been brought into the country illegally but were taken at customs. Had an ice cream",
          "My favorite museum. I go to all the new exhibitions and visited the permanent ones several times with visiting relatives and friends. The outside architecture is unimpressive (looks outdated already) and the inside is plain. It's all about the exhibitions. The permanent ones are",

          "A striking architectural building with great views from the roof. Small coffee bar 4th floor. Permanent displays very interesting covering a wide range of interest. The temporary display on \"venom\" was superb with details of venoms and toxins, their effects and origins, as well",

          "We rode our bicycles from Park Head of Gold to Musee des Confluences. It was a long way but such an easy ride and so pleasurable. Lyon has made the most of the banks of the River Rhone and the area around the Musee des Confluences was very peaceful and park like",

          "I am just amazed by this wonderful museum, it seems to defy the laws of both geometry and gravity! The exhibitions covering humanity and the planet.. are just remarkable. It should be on the to do list as it is definitely worth your while! You can spend quite a bit of time there",

          "We loved most of the exhibits, especially the Venenum (poison) one. It seemed a bit disjointed at first, switching back and forth between sources of poison and historical use of it, but it helped keep us from getting information overload. \u2026",
          "For a new-build, I thought the layout and flow of the visit could have been better.",

          "Outstanding location between the Rhone and Saone rivers. Architeture is monumental and worths the tour even if you're not interested in the exhibitions. Permanent and temporary shows have a big emphasis on museography, they give the feeling of an amusement park ride rather than a pluridisciplinary art-science work.",
          "A brand new museum with both interesting permanent and temporary collections. There is a nice view on the city and the rivers from the terrace. The price is fair as well.",

          "Even though I find an architectual design of museum pretencious and a mere copy of Franh Gery's aesthetic, exhibitions, both permanet and temporary, about Korto Malteze are just fantastic. You can find cool souvenirs in a museum shop, my tip would be T-shirt with Hugo Pratt's drawings from Korto comics.",

        "wiki": "The Place des Terreaux is a square located in the center of Lyon, France on the Presqu'\u00eele between the Rh\u00f4ne and the Sa\u00f4ne, at the foot of the hill of La Croix-Rousse in the 1st arrondissement of Lyon. The square belongs to the zone classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe square has these borders:\n\nOn the east by the Lyon City Hall\nOn the south by the Palais Saint-Pierre and the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon\nOn the west by a building through a gallery\nOn the north by civilian buildings marking the beginning of the slopes of the La Croix-Rousse\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The front wall of the square ===\nIn 1206, associations of merchants of Lyon ran to Archbishop Renaud II de Forez, who failed to comply with the charter signed in 1195 by violating the agreements made in respect of taxes on goods. To protect the village of Saint-Nizier from ecclesiastical power, the bourgeois of Lyon then decided to raise a wall at the foot of the hill of Saint-S\u00e9bastien (slope of the Croix-Rousse) and a tower on the Sa\u00f4ne to control the bridge of the Exchange, which was the sole passage between Saint-Nizier and Saint-Jean (a parish on the west side of the Sa\u00f4ne, in Vieux Lyon); de Forez intervened by force of arms in 1208, and peace returned through the intervention of Pope Innocent III.\nHowever, Renaud de Forez and his successors continued the works undertaken by the bourgeois of Lyon, in order to protect the city from a potential attack by the Dombes. A two-metre-thick and ten-metre-high new wall was built between the Sa\u00f4ne and Rh\u00f4ne. Approximately 500 metres long, this enclosure was pierced by two gates defended by drawbridges (la Porte de la P\u00eacherie o the Sa\u00f4ne et la porte de la Lanterne) and protected by ten towers. A crenelated walk and five stone booths allowed soldiers to watch at the top. The main wall was separated by a 22-metre ditch from another two-metre wall located to the north. In the fourteenth century, a third structure built into the slope was added, then, at the beginning of the 15th century, a new structure was built on the Saint S\u00e9bastien hilltop, consisting of a mound of earth protected by wood towers. In case of siege, the ditch, which was called Terralia nova (Foss\u00e9s of Terreaux) or Foss\u00e9s de la Lanterne, could be filled with water. This one entered when needed in a succession of basins, called the Neyron channel, dug laterally to the Rhone.\nUnder normal circumstances, the crossbowmen, then culverin men used ditches as a training location, first on the Sa\u00f4ne side, then from 1533 on the Rh\u00f4ne side.\n\n\n=== The garden and the square ===\n\nIn the 16th century, the walls crumbled. In 1538, the demolition of the enclosure was initiated. The ditch located on the Sa\u00f4ne side was filled later to build the Boucherie de la Lanterne. In 1555, the nuns of the convent Saint-Pierre were allowed to use the stones of the wall to repair the monastery. In 1578, the lands of the current Place des Terreaux were filled, and in 1617, the former ditch disappeared with the development of the gardens of city hall on which the Opera stand today.\nBetween 1646 and 1651, Simon Maupin built on the eastern side of the square the H\u00f4tel de ville de Lyon, rebuilt by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, after the fire of 1674. In the 17th century, the nuns of Saint-Pierre rebuilt their convent, which became in 1803 the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon.\nOn this square was beheaded the Henri Coiffier de Ruz\u00e9, Marquis of Cinq-Mars, who was a conspirator against Richelieu. During the French Revolution, the guillotine was installed and running at full speed during the tenure of Marie Joseph Chalier. After the siege of Lyon, 79 people were also beheaded.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, access to the site was expanded to accommodate the restructuring plan of the peninsula led by Claude-Marius Va\u00efsse. In 1855, the passage of Terreaux was opened between the square and the Lanterne street. The prefect also planned to drill a new street in the north axis of the Palais Saint-Pierre, but this project was never realized.\nAt the center of the square, the municipal officials inaugurated on 22 September 1891 an allegorical fountain of the Sa\u00f4ne, made by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi. The sculpted group called Char triomphant de la Garonne represents the Garonne and its four tributaries jumping into the ocean, all of which are symbolized by a woman leading a Quadriga. After the 1889 Exposition Universelle, the monument became too expensive for the city of Bordeaux and was bought in 1890 by the Mayor of Lyon, Antoine Gailleton.\nThe square was redeveloped in 1994 by architect and urban planner Christian Drevet and artist Daniel Buren, including an orthogonal rotation of 69 jets of water lined with 14 pillars. To build the underground parking of the square, the fountain was originally located in front of city hall, then moved to its current location in the axis of the palace Saint-Pierre.\nOn 29 September 1995, the square was classified as a monument historique.\nDuring the cold winter of 2012, the fountain situated in Place des Terreaux froze.\n\n\n== Photos ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of streets and squares in Lyon\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in French) History of the place",

          "In my opinion, probably the only place worth seeing in an ugly, dirty city. Ok, a stroll along the banks of the two rivers or on the main street from where you can reach the square is not bad, but I didn't like the atmosphere and the people at all. I didn't feel safe in this",

        "wiki": "Lyon or Lyons (UK: , US: , French: [lj\u0254\u0303] (listen); Arpitan: Liyon, pronounced [\u028ej\u0254\u0303]; Italian: Lione, pronounced [li\u02c8one]) is the third-largest city and second-largest urban area of France. It is located at the confluence of the rivers Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne, about 470 km (292 mi) south of Paris, 320 km (199 mi) north of Marseille and 56 km (35 mi) northeast of Saint-\u00c9tienne. Inhabitants of the city are called Lyonnais.\nLyon had a population of 513,275 in 2015. It is the capital of the Metropolis of Lyon and the region of Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes. The Lyon metropolitan area had a population of 2,265,375 in 2014. The city is known for its cuisine and gastronomy, and historical and architectural landmarks; part of it is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Lyon was historically an important area for the production and weaving of silk. Lyon played a significant role in the history of cinema: it is where Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re invented the cinematograph. It is also known for its light festival, the F\u00eate des Lumi\u00e8res, which begins every 8 December and lasts for four days, earning Lyon the title of Capital of Lights.\nEconomically, Lyon is a major centre for banking, as well as for the chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotech industries. The city contains a significant software industry with a particular focus on video games, and in recent years has fostered a growing local start-up sector. Lyon hosts the international headquarters of Interpol, the International Agency for Research on Cancer and Euronews. According to the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute, Lyon is considered a Beta city, as of 2018. It ranked second in France and 40th globally in Mercer's 2019 liveability rankings.\n\n\n== History of Lyon ==\n\n\n=== Ancient Lyon ===\n\nAccording to the historian Dio Cassius, in 43 BC, the Roman Senate ordered the creation of a settlement for Roman refugees of war with the Allobroges. These refugees had been expelled from Vienne and were now encamped at the confluence of the Sa\u00f4ne and Rh\u00f4ne rivers. The foundation was built on Fourvi\u00e8re hill and officially called Colonia Copia Felix Munatia, a name invoking prosperity and the blessing of the gods. The city became increasingly referred to as Lugdunum (and occasionally Lugudunum). The earliest translation of this Gaulish place-name as \"Desired Mountain\" is offered by the 9th-century Endlicher Glossary. In contrast, some modern scholars have proposed a Gaulish hill-fort named Lug[o]dunon, after the Celtic god Lugus ('Light', cognate with Old Irish Lugh, Modern Irish L\u00fa), and d\u00fanon (hill-fort).\n\nThe Romans recognised that Lugdunum's strategic location at the convergence of two navigable rivers made it a natural communications hub. The city became the starting point of main Roman roads in the area, and it quickly became the capital of the province, Gallia Lugdunensis. Two Emperors were born in this city: Claudius, whose speech is preserved in the Lyon Tablet in which he justifies the nomination of Gallic Senators, and Caracalla.\nEarly Christians in Lyon were martyred for their beliefs under the reigns of various Roman emperors, most notably Marcus Aurelius and Septimius Severus. Local saints from this period include Blandina, Pothinus, and Epipodius, among others. The Greek Irenaeus was the second bishop of Lyon during the latter part of the second century. To this day, the archbishop of Lyon is still referred to as \"Primat des Gaules\".Burgundians fleeing the destruction of Worms by the Huns in 437 were re-settled at Lugdunum. In 443 the Romans established the Kingdom of the Burgundians, and Lugdunum became its capital in 461. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, Lyon went to the Holy Roman Emperor Lothair I. It later was made part of the Kingdom of Arles. Lyon did not come under French control until the 14th century.\n\n\n=== Modern Lyon ===\nFernand Braudel remarked, \"Historians of Lyon are not sufficiently aware of the bi-polarity between Paris and Lyon, which is a constant structure in French development...from the late Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution\". In the late 15th century, the fairs introduced by Italian merchants made Lyon the economic counting house of France. Even the Bourse (treasury), built in 1749, resembled a public bazaar where accounts were settled in the open air. When international banking moved to Genoa, then Amsterdam, Lyon remained the banking centre of France.\nDuring the Renaissance, the city's development was driven by the silk trade, which strengthened its ties to Italy. Italian influence on Lyon's architecture is still visible among historic buildings. In the late 1400s and 1500s Lyon was also a key centre of literary activity and book publishing, both of French writers (such as Maurice Sc\u00e8ve, Antoine Heroet, and Louise Lab\u00e9) and of Italians in exile (such as Luigi Alamanni and Gian Giorgio Trissino).\n\nIn 1572, Lyon was a scene of mass violence by Catholics against Protestant Huguenots in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. Two centuries later, Lyon was again convulsed by violence when, during the French Revolution, the citizenry rose up against the National Convention and supported the Girondins. The city was besieged by Revolutionary armies for over two months before surrendering in October 1793. Many buildings were destroyed, especially around the Place Bellecour, while Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois and Joseph Fouch\u00e9 administered the execution of more than 2,000 people. The Convention ordered that its name be changed to \"Liberated City\" and a plaque was erected that proclaimed \"Lyons made war on Liberty; Lyons no longer exists.\" A decade later, Napoleon ordered the reconstruction of all the buildings demolished during this period.\nThe Convention was not the only target within Lyon during the 1789-1799 French Revolution. After the National Convention faded into history, the French Directory appeared and days after the September 4, 1797, Coup of 18 Fructidor, a Directory's commissioner was assassinated in Lyon.\nThe city became an important industrial town during the 19th century. In 1831 and 1834, the canuts (silk workers) of Lyon staged two major uprisings for better working conditions and pay. In 1862, the first of Lyon's extensive network of funicular railways began operation.\nDuring World War II, Lyon was a centre for the occupying Nazi forces, including Klaus Barbie, the infamous \"Butcher of Lyon\". But the city was also a stronghold of the French Resistance \u2013 the many secret passages known as traboules enabled people to escape Gestapo raids. On 3 September 1944, Lyon was liberated by the 1st Free French Division and the Forces Fran\u00e7aises de l'Int\u00e9rieur. The city is now home to a resistance museum.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne converge to the south of the historic city centre, forming a peninsula \u2013 the \"Presqu'\u00eele\" \u2013 bounded by two large hills to the west and north and a large plain eastward. Place Bellecour is located on the Presqu'\u00eele between the two rivers and is the third-largest public square in France. The broad, pedestrian-only Rue de la R\u00e9publique leads north from Place Bellecour.\nThe northern hill is La Croix-Rousse, known as \"the hill that works\" because it is traditionally home to many small silk workshops, an industry for which the city has long been renowned.The western hill is Fourvi\u00e8re, known as \"the hill that prays\" because it is the location for Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re basilica, several convents, and Archbishop residence. The district, Vieux Lyon, also hosts the Tour m\u00e9tallique (a highly visible TV tower, replicating the last stage of the Eiffel Tower) and one of the city's funicular railways. Fourvi\u00e8re, along with portions of the Presqu'\u00eele and much of La Croix-Rousse, is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.East of the Rh\u00f4ne from the Presqu'\u00eele is a large flat area upon which sits much of modern Lyon and contains most of the city's population. Situated in this area is La Part-Dieu urban centre, which clusters the landmark structures Tour Part-Dieu, Tour Oxyg\u00e8ne, and Tour Swiss Life, as well as the city's primary railway station, Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu.\nNorth of this district lays the sixth arrondissement, which is home to one of Europe's largest urban parks, the Parc de la T\u00eate d'or, as well as Lyc\u00e9e du Parc and Interpol's world headquarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLyon has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), bordering on an oceanic climate (Cfb) due to the higher average temperature being around 22 \u00b0C. But in modified classifications such as that of Trewartha, France's third largest city has an oceanic climate (Do).  The mean temperature in Lyon in the coldest month is 3.2 \u00b0C (37.8 \u00b0F) in January and in the warmest month in July is 22 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Precipitation is adequate year-round, at an average of 830 mm (32.7 in), but the winter months are the driest. The highest recorded temperature was 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) on 13 August 2003 while the lowest recorded temperature was \u221224.6 \u00b0C (\u221212.3 \u00b0F) on 22 December 1938.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nLike Paris and Marseille, the city of Lyon is divided into a number of municipal arrondissements, each of which is identified by a number and has its own council and town hall. Five arrondissements were originally created in 1852, when three neighbouring communes (La Croix-Rousse, La Guilloti\u00e8re, and Vaise) were annexed by Lyon. Between 1867 and 1959, the third arrondissement (which originally covered the whole of the Left Bank of the Rh\u00f4ne) was split three times, creating a new arrondissement in each case. Then, in 1963, the commune of Saint-Rambert-l'\u00cele-Barbe was annexed to Lyon's fifth arrondissement. A year later, in 1964, the fifth was split to create Lyon's 9th \u2013 and, to date, final \u2013 arrondissement. Within each arrondissement, the recognisable quartiers or neighbourhoods are:\n\n1st arrondissement: Slopes of La Croix-Rousse, Terreaux, Martini\u00e8re/St-Vincent\n2nd arrondissement: Cordeliers, Bellecour, Ainay, Perrache, Confluence, Sainte-Blandine\n3rd arrondissement: Guilloti\u00e8re (north), Pr\u00e9fecture, Part-Dieu, Villette, Dauphin\u00e9/Sans Souci, Montchat, Grange Blanche (north), Monplaisir (north)\n4th arrondissement: Plateau de la Croix-Rousse, Serin\n5th arrondissement: Vieux Lyon (Saint-Paul, Saint-Jean, Saint-Georges), Saint-Just, Saint-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e, Fourvi\u00e8re, Point du Jour, M\u00e9nival, Batti\u00e8res, Champvert (south)\n6th arrondissement: Brotteaux, Bellecombe, Parc de la T\u00eate d'or, Cit\u00e9 Internationale\n7th arrondissement: Guilloti\u00e8re (south), Jean Mac\u00e9, Gerland\n8th arrondissement: Monplaisir (south), Bachut, \u00c9tats-Unis, Grand Trou/Moulin \u00e0 Vent, Grange Blanche (south), La\u00ebnnec, Mermoz, Monplaisir-la-Plaine\n9th arrondissement: Vaise, Duch\u00e8re, Rochecardon, St-Rambert-l'\u00cele-Barbe, Gorge de Loup, Observance, Champvert (north)Geographically, Lyon's two main rivers, the Sa\u00f4ne and the Rh\u00f4ne, divide the arrondissements into three groups:\n\nTo the west of the Sa\u00f4ne, the fifth arrondissement covers the old city (Vieux Lyon), Fourvi\u00e8re hill and the plateau beyond. The 9th is immediately to the north, and stretches from Gorge de Loup, through Vaise to the neighbouring suburbs of \u00c9cully, Champagne-au-Mont-d'Or, Saint-Didier-au-Mont-d'Or, Saint-Cyr-au-Mont-d'Or and Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or.\nBetween the two rivers, on the Presqu'\u00eele, are the second, first, and fourth arrondissements. The second includes most of the city centre,  Bellecour and Perrache railway station, and reaches as far as the confluence of the two rivers. The first is directly to the north of the second and covers part of the city centre (including the H\u00f4tel de Ville) and the slopes of La Croix-Rousse. To the north of the Boulevard is the fourth arrondissement, which covers the Plateau of La Croix-Rousse, up to its boundary with the commune of Caluire-et-Cuire.\nTo the east of the Rh\u00f4ne, are the third, sixth, seventh, and eighth arrondissements.\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nThe Roman ruins on the hillside near the Fourvi\u00e8re Basilica, with the Ancient Theatre of Fourvi\u00e8re, the Odeon of Lyon and the accompanying Gallo-Roman museum;\nAmphitheatre of the Three Gauls \u2013 ruins of a Roman amphitheatre.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===\nCathedral of St. John, a medieval church with architectural elements of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, also the principal religious structure in the city and the seat of the Archbishop of Lyon;\nBasilica of St-Martin-d'Ainay, one of the rare surviving Romanesque basilica-style churches in Lyon;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Paul, Romanesque (12th and 13th century) and Gothic (15th\u201316th century) church;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Bonaventure, 14th- and 15th-century Gothic church;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Nizier, Gothic church from the 15th century, having a doorway carved in the 16th century by Philibert Delorme;\nVieux Lyon (English: Old Lyon) area, Medieval and Renaissance quarter of the town, with shops, dining and cobbled streets;\nThe many Renaissance h\u00f4tels particuliers of the Old Lyon quarter, such as the H\u00f4tel de Bullioud, were also built by Philibert Delorme.\n\n\n=== 17th and 18th centuries ===\nCity Hall on the Place des Terreaux, built by architects Jules Hardouin-Mansart and Robert de Cotte;\nMus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Lyon, fine arts museum housed in a former convent of the 17th century, including the Baroque chapelle Saint-Pierre;\nH\u00f4tel-Dieu de Lyon (17th and 18th century), historical hospital with a baroque chapel;\nTemple du Change (17th and 18th century), former stock exchange of Lyon, Protestant temple since the 18th century;\nPlace Bellecour, one of the largest town squares in Europe;\nChapelle de la Trinit\u00e9 (1622), the first Baroque chapel built in Lyon, and part of the former \u00c9cole de la Trinit\u00e9, now Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Amp\u00e8re;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Polycarpe (1665\u20131670), Classical church;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Just (16th to 18th century), Classical church;\nSaint-Bruno des Chartreux (17th and 18th century), church, masterpiece of Baroque architecture;\n\u00c9glise Notre Dame Saint-Vincent (18th century), Neo-classical church.\n\n\n=== 19th century and modern city ===\nOp\u00e9ra Nouvel (1831), renovated in 1993 by Jean Nouvel;\nTh\u00e9\u00e2tre des C\u00e9lestins (1877), designed by Gaspard Andr\u00e9;\nBasilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re, large 19th-century basilica on the top of Fourvi\u00e8re Hill;\nTour m\u00e9tallique de Fourvi\u00e8re (1894);\nLa Mouche Cattle Market and Abbatoir (1914, 1928), designed by Tony Garnier;\nSainte Marie de La Tourette monastery (1960) designed by Le Corbusier;\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry International Airport (formerly Satolas Airport), designed by Guillaume Gilbert;\nGare de Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (1994) by Santiago Calatrava;\nPalais des congr\u00e8s de Lyon (1998), designed by Renzo Piano and a group of buildings for various functions;\nTour du Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais;\nTour Oxyg\u00e8ne;\nTour Incity.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Lyon (Fine Arts Museum), main museum of the city and one of the largest art galleries in France.

Lyon and its region Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes represent one of the most important economies in Europe and, according to Loughborough University, can be compared to Philadelphia, Mumbai or Athens with regard to its international position. The city of Lyon is working in partnership to more easily enable the establishment of new headquarters in the territory (ADERLY, Chambre du commerce et d'industrie, Grand Lyon...). High-tech industries such as biotechnology, software development, video game (Arkane Studios, Ivory Tower, Eden Games, EA France, Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe), and internet services are also growing. Other important sectors include medical research and technology, non-profit institutions, and universities. Lyon is home to the P4-Inserm\u2013ean Merieux Laboratory which conducts top-level vaccine research.The city is home to the headquarters of many large companies such as Groupe SEB, Sanofi Pasteur, Renault Trucks, Norbert Dentressangle, LCL S.A., Descours & Cabaud, Merial, Point S, BioM\u00e9rieux, Iveco Bus, Compagnie Nationale du Rh\u00f4ne, GL Events, April Group, Boiron, Feu Vert, Panzani, Babolat, Euronews, Lyon Airports, LVL Medical, and inter-governmental agencies IARC, Interpol.\nThe specialisation of some sectors of activities has led to the creation of many main business centres:\nLa Part-Dieu, located in the 3rd arrondissement is the second biggest business quarter after La D\u00e9fense in Paris with over 1,600,000 m2 (17,222,256.67 sq ft) of office space and services and more than 55,000 jobs. Cit\u00e9 Internationale, created by the architect Renzo Piano is located in the border of the Parc de la T\u00eate d'Or in the 6th arrondissement. The worldwide headquarters of Interpol is located there. The district of Confluence, in the south of the historic centre, is a new pole of economical and cultural development.\nTourism is an important part of the Lyon economy, with one billion euros in 2007 and 3.5 million hotel-nights in 2006 provided by non-residents. Approximately 60% of tourists visit for business, with the rest for leisure. In January 2009, Lyon ranked first in France for hostels business. The festivals most important for attracting tourists are the F\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res, the Nuits de Fourvi\u00e8re every summer, the Biennale d'art contemporain and the Nuits Sonores.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nSince the Middle Ages, the region residents have spoken several dialects of Franco-Proven\u00e7al. The Lyonnais dialect was replaced by the French language as the importance of the city grew. However some \"frenchified\" Franco-Proven\u00e7al words can also be heard in the French of the Lyonnais, who call their little boys and girls \"gones\" and \"fenottes\" for example.\nThe Lumi\u00e8re brothers pioneered cinema in the town in 1895. The Institut Lumi\u00e8re, built as Auguste Lumiere's house, and a fascinating piece of architecture in its own right, holds many of their first inventions and other early cinematic and photographic artifacts.\n8 December each year is marked by the Festival of Lights (la F\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res), a celebration of thanks to the Virgin Mary, who purportedly saved the city from a deadly plague in the Middle Ages. During the event, the local population places candles (lumignons) at their windows and the city of Lyon organizes impressive large-scale light shows onto the sides of important Lyonnais monuments, such as the medieval Cath\u00e9drale St-Jean.\nThe Saint Francis of Sales church is famous for its large and unaltered Cavaill\u00e9-Coll pipe organ, attracting audiences from around the world.\nThe Op\u00e9ra Nouvel (New Opera House) is the home of the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon. The original opera house was re-designed by the distinguished French architect Jean Nouvel between 1985 and 1993 and is named after him.\nLyon is also the French capital of \"trompe l'\u0153il\" walls, a very ancient tradition. Many are to be seen around the city. This old tradition is now finding a contemporary expression, for example in the art of Guillaume Bottazzi.\nThe Brothers of the Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic congregation that operates schools in Europe and North America, was founded in Lyon in 1821.\nThe African Museum of Lyon is one of the oldest museums situated in Lyon.\nThe Museum of Resistance and Deportation looks at the various individuals prominent in the Resistance movement in World War II. The building is strongly linked to Klaus Barbie. Lyon sees itself as the center of the French resistance and many members were shot in Place Bellecour in the town center. The exhibition is largely a series of mini-biographies of those involved.\nThe unusual project Lyon Dubai City, a reproduction of some districts of Lyon in Dubai, is a major point for tourism in Lyon.\nLyon is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission Intercultural cities program.\n\n\n=== UNESCO World Heritage Site ===\nThe Historic Site of Lyon was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998. In its designation, UNESCO cited the \"exceptional testimony to the continuity of urban settlement over more than two millennia on a site of great commercial and strategic significance.\" The specific regions comprising the Historic Site include the Roman district and Fourvi\u00e8re, the Renaissance district (Vieux Lyon), the silk district (slopes of Croix-Rousse), and the Presqu'\u00eele, which features architecture from the 12th century to modern times.\nBoth Vieux Lyon and the slopes of Croix-Rousse are known for their narrow passageways (named traboules) that pass through buildings and link streets on either side. The first examples of traboules are thought to have been built in Lyon in the 4th century. The traboules allowed the inhabitants to get from their homes to the Sa\u00f4ne quickly and allowed the canuts on the Croix-Rousse hill to get from their workshops to the textile merchants at the foot of the hill.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\n\nLyon has a long and chronicled culinary arts tradition. The noted food critic Curnonsky referred to the city as \"the gastronomic capital of the world\", a claim repeated by later writers such as Bill Buford.  Renowned 3-star Michelin chefs such as Marie Bourgeois and Eug\u00e9nie Brazier developed Lyonnaise cuisine into a national phenomenon favoured by the French elite; a tradition which Paul Bocuse later turned into a worldwide success.The bouchon is a traditional Lyonnais restaurant that serves local fare such as sausages, duck p\u00e2t\u00e9 or roast pork, along with local wines. Two of France's best known wine-growing regions are located near the city: the Beaujolais region to the north and the C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne region to the south.  Another Lyon tradition is a type of brunch food called \"m\u00e2chons\", made of local charcuterie and usually accompanied by Beaujolais red wine. M\u00e2chons were the customary meal of the canuts, the city's silk workers, who ate a late-morning meal after they finished their shifts in the factories.Other traditional local dishes include coq au vin; quenelle; gras double; salade lyonnaise (lettuce with bacon, cro\u00fbtons and a poached egg); and the sausage-based rosette lyonnaise and andouillette. Popular local confections include marron glac\u00e9 and coussin de Lyon. Cervelle de canut (literally, \"silk worker's brains\") is a cheese spread/dip made of a base of fromage blanc, seasoned with chopped herbs, shallots, salt, pepper, olive oil and vinegar.\nMore recently, the french tacos was invented in Lyon suburbs in the early 2000s and is now worldwide famous.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nLyon is home to the football club Olympique Lyonnais (OL), whose men's team plays in Ligue 1 and has won the championship of that competition seven times, all consecutively from 2002 to 2008). OL played until December 2015 at the 43,000-seat Stade de Gerland, which also hosted matches of the 1998 FIFA World Cup.  Since 2016, the team has played at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais, a 59,000-seat stadium located in the eastern suburb of D\u00e9cines-Charpieu. OL operates a women's team, Olympique Lyonnais F\u00e9minin, which competes in and dominates Division 1 F\u00e9minine. They are on a streak of 13 top-flight championships (2007\u2013present), and additionally claim the four titles won by the original incarnation of FC Lyon, a women's football club that merged into OL in 2004 (the current FC Lyon was founded in 2009). The OL women have also won the UEFA Women's Champions League six times, including the two most recent editions in 2018 and 2019. Lyon will host the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Semi-Finals as well as the 7 July Final at Stade de Lyon.\nLyon has a rugby union team, Lyon OU, in the Top 14, which moved into Stade de Gerland full-time in 2017\u201318. In addition, Lyon has a rugby league side called Lyon Villeurbanne that plays in the French rugby league championship. The club's home is the Stade Georges Lyvet in Villeurbanne.\nLyon is also home to the Lyon Hockey Club, an ice hockey team that competes in France's national ice hockey league. The Patinoire Charlemagne is the seat of Club des Sports de Glace de Lyon, the club of Olympic ice dancing champions Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, and world champions Isabelle Delobel and Olivier Shoenfelder.

It was formed in 1987. It serves Japanese expatriate children who wish to continue their Japanese education whilst abroad.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nLyon\u2013Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport, located east of Lyon, serves as a base for domestic and international flights. It is a key transport facility for the entire Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, with coach links to other cities in the area. The in-house train station Gare de Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry connects the airport to the nationwide TGV network. The Rh\u00f4nexpress tram monopoly links the airport with the business quarter of La Part Dieu in less than 30 minutes, and offers connections with Underground A & B, Tramway T1, T3 & T4, and bus lines. Lyon public transport Sytral offers a bus service, Route 47, that links the airport to Meyzieu where passengers can change onto Tram T3. The regular price of public transport is \u20ac1.90, as opposed to \u20ac15 one way for the Rhonexpress. In the suburb of Bron, the smaller Lyon-Bron Airport provides an alternative for domestic aviation.\nLyon has two major railway stations: Lyon Part-Dieu, which was built to accommodate the TGV, and Lyon Perrache, an older station that now provides mostly regional service. Smaller railway stations include Gorge-de-Loup, Vaise, V\u00e9nissieux, Saint-Paul and Jean Mac\u00e9. Lyon was the first city to be connected to Paris by the TGV in 1981. Since that time the TGV train network has expanded and links Lyon directly to Perpignan, Toulouse, Nice, Marseille, Strasbourg, Nantes and Lille. International trains operate directly to Madrid, Barcelona, Milan, Turin, Geneva, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Brussels and London.\nThe city is at the heart of a dense road network and is located at the meeting point of several highways: A6 (to Paris); A7 (to Marseille); A42 (to Geneva); and A43 (to Grenoble). The city is now bypassed by the A46. A double motorway tunnel passes under Fourvi\u00e8re, connecting the A6 and the A7 autoroutes, both forming the \"Autoroute du Soleil\".\nLyon is served by the Eurolines intercity coach organisation. Its Lyon terminal is located at the city's Perrache railway station, which serves as an intermodal transportation hub for tramways, local and regional trains and buses, the terminus of Metro line A, of the Tramway T2, the bicycle service V\u00e9lo'v, and taxis.\n\nThe Transports en commun lyonnais (TCL), Lyon's public transit system, consisting of metro, tramways and buses, serves 62 communes of the Lyon metropolis. The metro network has four lines ( A   B   C   D ), 42 stations, and runs with a frequency of up to a train every 2 minutes. There are five Lyon tram lines ( T1  T2  T3  T4  T5) since April 2009: T1 from Debourg in the south to IUT-Feyssine in the north, Tram T2 from Perrache railway station to Saint-Priest in the south-east, Tram T3 from Part-Dieu to Meyzieu, Tram T4 from 'H\u00f4ptial Feyzin Venissieux' to Gaston Berger. Tram T5 from Grange Blanche, in the south-east to Eurexpo in the south-wast. The Lyon bus network consists of the Lyon trolleybus system, motorbuses, and coaches for areas outside the centre. There are also two funicular lines from Vieux Lyon to Saint-Just and Fourvi\u00e8re. The ticketing system is relatively simple as the city has only one public transport operator, the SYTRAL.\nThe public transit system has been complemented since 2005 by V\u00e9lo'v, a bicycle network providing a low-cost service where bicycles can be hired and returned at any of 340 stations throughout the city.  Borrowing a bicycle for less than 30 minutes is free. Free rental time can be extended for another 30 minutes at any station. Lyon was the first city in France to introduce this bicycle renting system. In 2011 the Auto'lib car rental service was introduced; it works much the same way as the Velo'v but for cars.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Lyon on a weekday is 45 minutes. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 17% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.7 km, while 4% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLyon is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission \"Intercultural cities\" program.\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nLyon is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGallia Lugdunensis\nList of movies set in Lyon\nList of people from Lyon\nList of streets and squares in Lyon\nM\u00e8res of France\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website(in French)\nVisit Lyon, the official website for tourism in France\nLyon Tourist Office and Convention Bureau\nLyon\u2019s English Language News and Information",

          "The wall artists have done a miraculous job. It is really tough to realize that these re drawings and not real stairs. All Lyon visitors must see them",
          "A fabulous mural with lots of beautiful details. This is the mural that started Lyons urban murals tradition. Take your time to study it and you will see all kinds of interesting details.",
          "We took a metro to Henon metro stop and walked for a short while to find this huge mural. Loved it. There are nice restaurants and not so touristic around Croix Rouge if you end up there at lunch or dinner time, Bistrot Orcia nearby Croix Rouge metro stop for example.",
          "Worth taking a walk up to see this amazing wall. I especially loved the description showing how it has changed over the years. Just genius!",
          "Our lovely Lyon Greeter Guide, Jean Claude, actually brought us here in his own car which otherwise we would not have found it at all. The mural is absolutely amazing--3D looking while it is not. About once every 10 years, the artists change the mural to reflect the aging of",
          "We visited this area with the Lyon Tram as it is a hike on foot. This mural is exquisite and there are many others in this area. Hurry for the artists of the world who sometimes just need a blank canvass.",
          "A very impressive piece of art. we took some pictures and then a walk around in the neighborhood which was nice.",
          "This is definitely worth the effort to see. One of the many murals in Lyon and one of the largest. Impressive.",
          "I cannot say that this is a \"must see\" item during your visit; however, if you have time and make your way to the top of the hill, then please have a look. It is very well executed and an interesting way to camouflage the actual face of the building behind the painting. Worth",
          "We didn't know about this mural so when we walked toward it from the Heonon metro we thought it was just another set of pretty buildings in our path - until we got closer! This is one amazing piece of illusionary artwork. Read about it on the panels in the passageway -",
          "The details in this work of art make it a must-see for tourists. The real and painted blend so well that you do a double-take when you realize that the French flag in the phot is blowing in the wind and is really hanging out of tje window.",
          "A little out of the way, but the Mur des Canuts in Lyon are a superb mural that\u2019s well worth a visit. This is not graffiti as I was expecting, but a piece of art.",
          "We caught a tram and then the funicular up to Croix-Rousse. Croix-Rousse is known as the \u201chill that works\u201d, as it was where the silk workers had their home factories in the 19Century. In 1987 it was decided that A blank wall in the area which was an eyesore, would be",
          "We visited using the tram & it was well worth the trip. Amazing sight. A wonderful disguise of a concrete wall. The tram tour was a great way to see Croix Rousse without climbing. Lasted about 1 hour",
          "We have seen Le Mur des Canuts twice now. Both times we saw it because we took the Lyon City Tram ride. This ride takes you up to Croix Rousse. On our first ride the driver stopped and let us get out to take photos. The second time the Driver hardly stopped. This was a shame.",
          "we walked up here and it took a while- but very cool to see and to see the evolution of the wall. Take a seat and take in the mural and all it has to offer.",
          "First of all, the neighborhood all around Croix Rousse is LOVELY. Ideally, take your partner to this site without telling them what it is. WOW. I self'ied myself with the mural in the background and got dozens of Likes by friends who could not believe what they saw. Be",
          "Amazing artistry if you are in the Croix-Rousse area and need a 15 minute diversion, or you enjoy street art and murals and want to take an easy ride on the C metro to the Henon station (a short walk downhill rather than an uphill walk). There are several other murals (labeled",
          "We stopped by the Le Mur Des Canuts during a Lyon City Tram tour and it was amazing to see how intricate and large this mural is. Windows of the building are incorporated into the mural and it has such depth. What is more impressive is the fact that this beautiful mural also",
          "We made a visit to Croix-Rousse, mainly in part to see this mural. It was worth the effort. Though its just a painting on the wall....stretch your imagination and take some pictures to be a part of the scene in the wall painting. Walk back down back to Place Carnot and enjoy",
          "These murals are painted on a flat wall and appear to be a three dimensional walkway in the city. Each decade they are changed to reflect current ideas. They are now reflecting the green earth with trees and plants on teh walkways. A must see in Lyon.",
          "It\u2019s difficult to believe on first sighting that this is a mural on a flat wall - the detail & perspective is amazing. The story of the wall & it\u2019s update over the years is also very interesting. Well worth the journey out there - use Henon on the metro line A",

          "I dragged my girlfriend on quite a walk to see this and it was worth it. I would recommend getting the subway still as this in itself is interesting going down the hill. The mural is a lot bigger than I expected and really interesting to just sit back and stare at all the",
          "We took a bike tour (electric bikes essential) around Lyon and this is one of the highlights. Massive blank wall transformed into a wonderful 3d picture which creates a real feeling of depth and perspective.",
          "very impressive fresque of the famous people native of Lyon. It's fun and colorful. If you are an artist, check it out.",
          "Well worth the trek to CroixRousse. The whole wall is a mural based on life in the area including silk weaving people.",
          "One of the best \"trompe-l'oeui\" I have ever seen on a building/wall. Its size is also massive! Try to find the few \"real\" elements in this huge canvas!",
          "This is a very interesting mural - actually, the latest of several. They've been updated over time, and there's a display of the previous versions. The artist actually aged the people in the earlier versions.",
          "There didn't seem to be much else to see in this neighbourhood besides this, but glad we made the walk up the hill to see this remarkable piece of art. The scale is incredible and we sat on a bench in front of it for some time, as there are so many individual scenes to notice.",
          "You really have to look close to see what's real and what's painted in this neighborhood. The major mural is the most interesting. Each person in the mural is from Lyon and many of these people are known worldwide. The technique is fascinating.",
          "This is even more amazing than the mur des lyonees. don't miss the small gallery on the left explaining the different phases of the painting",
          "The mini tram stopped for photos. From a block away you would not know that this wasn't the \"real thing.\" Definitely worth a visit",
          "This a place for which at the beginning you are thinking if it's worth going to, when you are going up the hill you are thinking about it twice as much but when you arrive at the place you see that is something not to lose.",
          "Le Mur Des Canuts is an amazing trompe l'oeil, which covers a surface of 1,200m\u00b2, it is hard to believe it is a flat surface, it is so life like. My husband wasn\u2019t looking properly and approached the ATM to get money out. There is so much happening in this mural and the detail",

          "Very good street art. Especially good is reading the history of the art across the years. Amazingly realistic and detailed. Worth the long walk. The rest of the area is uninteresting.",

          "A great reminder of the Lyon of the past - get a photo taken there and become a part of the mural! There are pictures of how the wall has changed over time to reflect the trends of each period... very clever and interesting!",
          "Cleverly painted with much to see and note. You must give yourself time to see the detail of the murals.",
          "One has to stand about 100 feet diagnolly across the road to get the best view. to save time, travel by metro to station Henon and it is just outside the exit",
          "I must say i almost walked right past this wall. Thank goodness there were a few people taking pictures there. Its a lovely mural and worth going there. Its close to the metro station as well in case you use public transport.",
          "This wall is a very nice painted wall, telling the history of this particular area of Lyon. However, it is situated in the Croix-Rousse area, which overall was a little disappointing for me. It's quite a trip if you want to reach this area from e.g. the Prequ'\u00eele area: you need",
          "This is well worth visiting. Fantastic wall murals which is very lifelike. Lyon is full of wall art and they are all worth visiting. The history of how Le Mur Des Canuts came about is very interesting and you can read all about it at the site.",
          "Le Mur Des Canuts are in the heart of silk district of Lyon, 1st. A canvas covers the building and it is updated every 10 years or so (if I recall correctly). Make the time to see this beautiful area of Lyon. Pictures do not do ,this work of art, justice,",
          "It\u2018s just a painting in the wall. Like, it\u2018s cute or whatever but it\u2018s def not a must see tho! Just go by and take a snap and move over with your life! There\u2018s more to see in Lyon! But i do like the area surrounding it, so cute!",
          "There are several well-executed wall murals around Lyon, many of them tucked away in the less touristy parts of Lyon. The best, in my view, is Le Mur des Canuts, but mainly because there are explanatory posters describing the history of this mural. It is huge too. It can be",
          "As a painter, I have a real admiration for murals and this one is particularly well done. Go there if you have the chance.",
          "If these walls could talk, they\u2019d tell you the story of Lyon. The Painted Walls of Lyon are a distinctive art form that brings art, history, and light to the districts of the city. The history of how the murals came to be is traced in the October 23, 2011, edition of France",
          "Definitely one of the highlights of our visit to Lyon. Incredible to believe it's a flat building. Plus the history is also fun in that it's changed over the years to reflect the changing attitudes and times in Lyon.",
          "Really liked seeing these - dotted all around central Lyon. Well worth a look and lot to explore in each one...",
          "These murals added interest to our walking tours! They were fun! They were interesting! They were another way to add beauty and art to the beautiful cityscape and another topic of discussion during our walk!",
          "Get to know this place via Lyon City Tram Tour, the driver allow us to dropby to have a 5mins photshot. Very distinctly especially from far.",
          "Well worth a walk up to the Croix Rousse area to see this spectacular mural of silk workers of the neighborhood in the 1800's. Looking at the mural of the buildings with windows and creepers- it all looks so real it's difficult to believe that it is all just an optical illusion",
          "When you see the before and after you are really in awe of the work that went into it. It\u00b4s def a must-see. you can get there by public transport or take the tram city tour, if you have the Lyon city card, the ride is free.",
          "Wow! Amazing! Exceptional! This left us in awe of the effort that went into detailing this wonderful mural. Yes, the photos capture its beauty but nothing can beat the pleasure of seeing it first-hand. We had bought the two-day Lyon pass and took the ride to see this wonderful",
          "Take some time off the beaten tourist tracking visit this wonderful illusion. Just off the Henon underground station, it looks and feels unique.",
          "I loved visiting this incredible wall. Its huge painting offers an incredible illusion. Great place for photos too. Worth walking just a few mins out of the more touristy areas in order to spot it.",
          "Le Mur Des Canuts is truly a masterpiece. You won't get tired of looking at all the details which seem so realistic, that nobody will be able to make a distinction in the selfie you'll take with your friends there.",
          "You can walk there from the \"quartier de la Croix-Rousse\" which is a hill with lots of short-cuts made of steps, some of them very steep. This itself is worth a visit. The Mur des Canuts is worth a visit. The boards close by which explain how it all came to be what it is today",
          "It's exactly what you see in the pictures -one side of one building painted up to look like a street scene. It is technically well executed but a bit of an empty novelty imo.",
          "Reading through the boards close by explaining the evolution of this magnificent work helps to explain how it all came to be what it is today Taking photos of each other against the background tricks friends and family into believing that it is all genuine Great fun!",
          "An absolute must when in Lyon. From a distance, one would believe that it is a \"real\" and not a painting!",
          "A clever and imaginative display of Lyon's famous people - but it helps to know your history of the area. A favourite spot for photos.",
          "It is a bit away from most tourist places, but worth a 10 mis walk from Croix Rousse without any doubts! We`ve spent 20-30 mins here just enjoying the extremally detailed painting about the typical lyonaise life and took some great pictures.",
          "Great place to start your visit of the Croix-Rousse district. Get off at the Henon metro station, go have a look at the impressive wall and start walking down the hill. If you're a fan of the street art and urban painting, this is a must-see!",
          "Amazing- it look so real from a distance. We took the lyon city tram- the driver allows us to stop for 5 mins to take photos.",
          "Lyon is a city of murals and this one is the best. It has a large staircase marching up at the center of the painting towards some distant buildings. On the bottom one can see a few shops and a bank. The pictures look almost real and only if you go closer you realise it is a",
          "The 3-D realistic mural covering an entire building, is the best of the many murals in Lyon. It is in the Croix-Rouse neighborhood. It is well worth the walk to get there. It is updated every 10 years, even the people painted in the mural appear to age. So neat.",
          "The highlight of the Lyon City Tram Tour to the Croix Rousse, which itself is well-worth doing. Made me want to explore the whole neighbourhood further on another trip.",
          "This apartment building has a huge fresco painted on the outside of the building which is just stunning. The subway stop - this part is a cog railway - is just metres from the building. You can buy a day pass for 5.20 euros which lasts 24 hours. You can then use your ticket to",
          "If you want to take nice photos or just chill enjoying the art, a 15min will be enough for this! There are benches to rest a little.",
          "My opinion is just a painting on the wall, not much to do around there ( maybe nothing ) and trying to get there by walk in , * sign * !",
          "Excellent example of how art can enhance and transform eyesores and dilapitaded areas into tourist attractions. This particular location was a big blank and ugly wall that now creates a vision or illusion of a dynamic and lively place. Nothing is what it seems, even when you are",
          "This is a major work of art on the wall of a building by artists from Lyon. A blank wall is more beautiful with paintings to look like a building.",
          "This is a wonderful mural covering an entire building and is one of the best of the many murals in Lyon. It is in the Croix-Rouse neighborhood and is well worth a visit.",
          "Really interesting, nice to see how the building looked before it was painted and how it's changed over the years. Very well done.",
          "We made our way on the metro to see this impressive mural. There is a small alcove in the wall which explains its history with photos of how it's changed over the years. There wasn't much else to do after taking some photo's so we walked back to l'hotel de ville through",
          "This gigantic hyper-realistic fresco depicting daily life in Lyon is great to look at in detail and worth a good look even if a bit out of the way.",
          "Was not sure whether to visit this site but it is easily accesible by metro and not far from the station. Impeessive 3D. visit the mur and then to walk down to croix rousse before going back to centre",
          "Easy train ride from hotel De ville, take Metro C towards Curie and get down at Henon.. Enjoy the beautiful murals and quick read on its history. Don't need more than 1 hour to go and come back from main city",
          "Great painting which describes the daily life of the then local people and what an imaginative way to make a focal point out of a very ordinary, featureless cement wall.",
          "it is worth a visit, The painting of the Lyonnais represents 25 historical figures from Lyon and 6 characters from the world.Lyon is well known for its wall paintings but this is one is my favorite because it is showing Lyon's famous people like L'Abb\u00e9 Pierre, Bernard Lacombe,",
          "huge and impressive wall painting with amazing 3D perspective. Worth a trip (close to a metro station).",
          "Although I'm not an art lover - these wall murals were amazing. a must see when you visit Lyon...there are many of them dotted around Lyon",
          "Impressive drawing. Worth a visit. Easy access by metro. Nice for taking pictures. One of the best wall art work.",
          "The art work on this wall is just amazing. It is hard to believe that everything is paint work and not the real thing. Stunning!",
          "So nice to see. One of the coolest street art places of this wonderful city. Totally recommend to go for a walk and admire its beauty. The city has such a strong character.",
          "Be sure to go and look at the posters round the back of the building that showcase the development of tha mural till its present form.",
          "We were reluctant before going there if it's worth it, but we were so wrong and speechless afterward. I don't remember having seen such a big thing elsewhere.",
          "Interesting \"living\" art disguising a large ugly wall. Small exhibits at the side show the progression of the work over about 30 years reflecting the changes of life style in the area",
          "Worth spending 15 minutes analyzing all the details done by the artists. It is a portrait of the neighborhood that in every restoration is updated including the age of the people in it. It is fascinating!",
          "These paintings on old buildings are spread around the area known as the Croix-Rousse. So cleverly don and so artistic. You can easily spend some time eyeing what these artists have done, whom they painted, etc,",
          "This wall has evolved over the years and is a marvel. If you are interested in street art done to a high level this is for you.",
          "On our first visit to La Croix-Rousse we were unable to find this amazing piece of artwork. We later discovered that the nearest Metro station is H\u00e9non & it was worth making the return journey to see it. It is utterly fascinating & deserves more publicity.",
          "They are at least 3 different ones that I saw. So well made, I really struggled trying to understand how they painted them. And sooooo big!!! You have to see them, there. Isn't a way I can fond to describe them",
          "Showcasing famous personalities from the Lyon history even the recent one, these walls are well worth the detour. The location is a bit off the usual tracks but not really far. Unusual and beautifully executed. Look for Paul Bocuse the famous Chef.",
          "Lyon is famous for its wall paintings but this is the best in my opinion. Not only does it show all aspects of the life of the canuts it is also updated on a regular basis.",
          "A massive trompe-l'oeil painting, on what must previously have been a hideous blank wall, that gives the illusion of an urban block with flats, shops and people. There are information panels in the nearby passage which explain its origins and the way in which it's been renewed",
          "it was an interesting, realistic portrayal of local life of the residents of lyon. a job well done by the artist.",
          "This is a very cool attraction in Lyon. It feels funny to stare at it so...if you stop in Lyon, search for it and you'l not regret!",
          "I think the title already says it - Nicely painted wall but I'd rather no make it an extra tour to visit. However ok if you happen to be in the Croix Rousse area.",
          "Located in Croix-Rousse ,you can walk but it is better to use the metro to Henon and come back by foot. You should see it as there are many details . Especially the combination of real and painted Windows is very nice.",
          "I have driven past this 100's of time and each time there is something else to notice, so simple but so clever,",
          "Certainly worth a little detour , this meters high painting in \"trompe l'oeil\" is just amazing! Quite unbelievable when you look at it that it actually hides a hideous FLAT wall ...",
          "take the metro D to Henon, go 150 meters and you are there. what a wounderfull site , really is !! whaen you go close and see all the details you can imagin how long did it take to put this creation on that building",
          "Astonishingly realistric mural of a city scene with many details to keep you entertained while you rest your feet on the bench.",
          "The mural is impressive. It's huge! Take some time to read the information at the corner of the building. I really love that the city took the effort to record down the changes in this neighbourhood.",
          "It is located in Croix-Rousse in Lyon, one of the must see in the city, you can see many of them when walking ..surprise !",
          "This is a wall painting on a massive scale that shows the life and activities of the local \"canuts\" or silkweavers. From the metro walk left a few hundred mteres and you cant miss it. The \"trompe l'oeil\" effect makes the wall look 3D and there is lots of details to explore. Make",
          "Le Mur des Canuts is a way to bring back to new residential areas to the tourism. This \"wall painting\" in particular depicts partly the life in town and gives life with very fresh colours the walls of a boring building facade. Nicely done, worth the picture(-s).",
          "Too many large cities around the globe seem to undervalue the artistic representation of their own culture. Lyon has created some very unique fresco wall paintings, all done with consumate expertise and a touch of humour throughout. This one is up in Croix-Rousse district and id",
          "Its amazing that this has been gradually painted over a period of years. From a distance, you cant even tell its a painting. Well worth a visit to appreciate the work thats gone into this. From what I can tell people actually live in the building too, which makes it all the",
          "The trompe-l'oeil painting on this block is unbelievably realistic and will have you standing and staring for ages! There is a lovely little exhibition to the left of the painted wall which describes its history and creation. Easiest way to get to it is to get the Metro line C",
          "It is really amazing to see these walls. The walls are changed into a picturesque beauty. On one of the walls you see paints of famous people of Lyon looking at you. You must take pictures or selfies with these figures.",
          "Definately worth the walk up the hill. Such a good idea to turn a negative into a positive. Very clever design plays tricks on your eyes. You will find yourself wanting to climb those stairs! Check out information boards below which show how it looked before and how it has",
          "This painting on a huge wall defies perspective to make you see things that do not exist, but only in image. There are a number of wall paintings in Lyon, but this one is the most famous. It is located in the Croix Rousse area, on top of the hill.",
          "Lovely well painted 'windows' with famous local people looking out of them! Keep your eyes open they are every where!!",
          "I loved this wall! So much nicer than the horrid old expanse of concrete it once was. It's great that you can read how this wall came to be and how it has been updated over the years. So very, very clever. I wish I lived nearby then I could look at it every day! We caught the",
          "Amazing street art and done to the perfection. Really interesting to see the explanations of the evolution of the wall.",
          "If you walk from the H\u00e9non direction you'll enjoy seeing the mural emerge form the streetscape. Take time to read the story boards (under the covered walkway) which describe the whys and whens....the characters in the mural have had years added as time has gone by. Fascinating",
          "The mural is quite large and when you see the before and after photos you will realise what a difference the mural makes to the building.",
          "Le Mur de Lyon! One of the painted walls that you will find in Lyon! There are some Maps where you will find Le tour des Murs! With that or with a quick research on the web, you can not afford to not see this! Impressive with is 3D effect, where you can actually get lost on",
          "The society that created this painting had also created several in Lyon, all outstanding for its precision. We had to do a double take on several parts of the paintings as it was very realistic. I recommend the one-hour tram-tour to visit this and other sights in Lyon, as to",
          "Not sure that it is worth a visit on its own unless you have a fascination for this type of art (Mur des Lyonnais is more interesting with local historical personalities) or are already visiting the hill. Take the C subway all the way to Henon and it is nearby, does not take",
          "It's a good painting in a wall, but I don't recomended to visit the area only for this painting. It's not worth it.",
          "A must when visiting Lyon. Stunningly executed murals, which are touched-up every 10 years or so by various artists, to adapt this large artwork to modern times.",
          "Located in the middle of residential area (the closest metro station is Henon) worth to stop by only if you are nearby. Don't make any special efforts if you are tied on time. Far away from city centre, Old historic part and Presqu'ile district. Nothing interesting around. Nice",
          "Impressive paiting and we had nice photos. On the wall inthe left of the paiting there are interesting explanations about the history of this amazing wall. You can take the tram for short visit.",
          "Yes, this did look very realistic, credits to the artists. I was thoroughly pleased with how they turned an ugly lifeless wall into a masterpiece. But if photos were what you were after, it is difficult to take a clean photo. Great to visit though.",
          "The talented artists did such a good job with the wall murals! They looked so real and the perspective drawing is incredible. I tried for so long to discern what was real and what was painted. I struggled to imagine what the original building looked like. The exhibit on the",
          "We went looking for this building in Croix Rousse and happened on it unexpectedly around a corner. You get a great view from across the intersection, but even more insight to the clever use of perspective by getting up close. The few simple historical images display the history",
          "Some truly gifted painters were at work here. Every time you look at it you see something more. How many cats do you see? How many windows are real and how many painted to seem real?",
          "It is a mural.. which is very big and look so real. Nice to see and take a few picture. But there is nothing much to see at the surounding area. Better take a metro the henoi then directly go to the mural and go back to the old city.",
          "A must-see on the Lyon tourist trail! Very life-like and impressive artwork, a true Lyon gem! In the lovely neighbourhood of Croix-Rousse.",
          "I love murals and this one is really special. You feel you can almost climb the stairs and touch the people depicted. To get there is also a good way to explore this neighborhood. It was a bit empty on a Monday afternoon in august so better maybe to go in the morning",
          "...it's amazing. Detailed, beautiful and so much to look at. Take time to have a focus on it - it's really worth it. Thankfully a friend explained who we were looking at. If you can have a local give you detail, it adds to the understanding.",
          "A quick and fascinating visit to very detail mural, a very beautiful and interesting place to see, well deserved to be appreciated and be thankful for those who made this possible to enjoy by many.",
          "Our Lyon Greeter guide took us there on the metro line so we came out facing Le Mur. Look carefully to see the characters and you to will be surprised. Well worth going up the hill. Le Mur des Canuts is an amazing work of art. Take time to study it and you will be",
          "Do not miss this wall. Take some time looking at the details. The perspective of the painting is amazing. Some objects in the painting seem very real.",
          "You will not believe you eyes and you mind will play tricks on you. The art work is amazing and it a perfect spot for imaginative photography",
          "We walked from the old city to this wall mural and I would suggest taking the Metro which has a stop very close by. The walk was quite steep and hot for us in the July sun. Once there we all really appreciated the scale and detail of the mural. It's a great example of turning",
          "My son and I took the metro to view the murals. A quick visit and we were back on the metro. We took pictures that we looked at later with my son \"blending into the mural\" Looks cool!",
          "A really cool place to go and sit. You need to take your time to look at all the murals, to discover details, and enjoy the creativity! I was in Valparaiso, Chile, and really recommend the city if you enjoyed le Mur des Canuts. Too bad my phone had run out of battery...",
          "This was a real surprise during our stay in Lyon. At first sight, it looks like a real building, with real stairs, people, cars... Then you realize it is a great painting. Do not miss it!",
          "We have walked by using google map to lead to this place. Before we see the highlight, graffiti giraffe on water piping was so cute. We then saw a tourist bus so that's it. It was so incredible mural which we have never seen before. It is so lively and humongous view. Splendid",
          "Since I spent a whole month in Lyon, I had time to go to Croix Rousse to see le mur des canutes. But if you're spending only a weekend in Lyon, there are a number of other things more interesting to see. Definitely not my favorite place in Lyon",
          "Very impressive murals, wonderfully designed and beautifully painted. They are, rightly, a source of pride for the city. The tour bus commentary makes the point that they are never tagged by graffiti artists. I reckon this is because an authentic mural is a community statement",
          "The murals are absolutely life like and very interesting to note that they were painted on the facades and changed over time. You do find similar ones all over Lyon. There are viewing benches for those who want to take in the details.",
          "I am very fond of murals and went to visit many of them. This one is very special because it's the 3rd updating, and each time they make the mural a little different and the painted people are older.",
          "Definitely this painted wall is better than just empty one :) And it's interesting to see how pictures were changed with time!",
          "This is worth a trip. Take the metro (yellow line) to Henon. Walk straight from the metro exit. Cross the street and pay attention. The mural is so realistic from certain points of view that it is surprising. You have to keep looking at it to absorb it all and it is well worth",
          "These huge building sized murals seem pretty real and its easy to miss. I would have missed it had someone not told me. There are many of these around the city and some have a meaning drawn from history. You don't have to go looking for these.",
          "What a great spot! Just across the street is a covered area with a photo of the first version, second version, and the current one. Many of the same people are featured in the mural, just aged 10 years. We saw it during a WONDERFUL Lyon City Greeter tour. (lyoncitygreeter.com)",
          "The pictures are all over the city and are enjoyable to look at because they depict different historical moments, famous people from Lyon, accomplishments and different aspects of life from the 1800s to modern day in Lyon. I think they are worth seeing because they really add",
          "Max 25 minute walk from Hotel de Ville area, close to Saone river, not difficult to be missed. Suggesting three dimensions for normal activities. Trompe l'oeil updated a couple of times during the last 30 years. Not to be missed if three \u00ees no time pressure.",
          "We were staying close to the Croix-Rousse area of the city, so it wasn't too much of a detour for us to go and see the rather alluring trompe l'oeil frescoes of Le Mur des Canuts. But be advised that it is quite a long way from central parts of Lyon. Originally first designed",
          "We were surprised to see this magnificent wall painting. There is so much symbolism in it. Good restaurants in the nice neighborhood and yes, it is for free!",
          "It is so well done that in some parts you can't really say if it is a paint or if it is real. It is amazing. Really worth checking it!",
          "Worth to see it if only you've visited everything else in Lyon. There is nothing that interesting in the neighborhood, but in the city center you can find some smaller painted walls",
          "this is a hidden jewel in Lyon. you can enjoy a nice walk up the streets of Crouix-roisse and be surprised by this Piece of art!",
          "Researched on internet for things to do in Lyon and found information on les fresques. So set about the city to find various painted murals, this one being the first I saw. Impressive realistic-looking large mural covering whole side of a building, and impressive talent to",
          "I stumbled upon this while walking through Croix Rousse on a Sunday morning. It's very well executed and the sort of thing you can stare at for ages and notice fun and new things. Really brightens up the neighbourhood.",
          "No doubt that the work is fantastic. You can stand and look wt the details for a long time. The story behind the art is great. But I don't think it worth going all the way to this part of town just to see it, which is what I did. If you are around the area stop by.",
          "Very nice use of a otherwise boring wall, its a colourful glimpse into life in Lyon. I wouldn't explicitly come in my first visit in the city but it's worth to do while exploring the Croix Rousse",
          "Reading on this project ahead of going to see this wall made it far more interesting. I totally enjoyed looking at the painting and appreciating its size and details.",
          "If you want to check out the traditional sewing machine this is a good place but there are nothing much to explore.",
          "Was very impressed by this mural. Highly recommended when you visit Croix rousse.It is also not crazy touristy crowded.",
          "Having our daughter with us helped as the map was quite tricky to follow. The secret laneways were well preserved although now most make up private residences. Being born in a county where war has not affected us it was so interesting to see how the French resistance moved",
          "I lived just a block from it for 5 months and it was a joy to walk past. Great pictures to be taken, history to be learned (the evolution of the wall is present) and just a lovely touch to a beautiful city.",
          "A very impressive piece of art, really. The murals of Lyon, several of them, shows what you can do with initiative, paint and some ideas, it sure beats leaving a crappy old wall to just be there with no purpose. Worth talking a walk round Croix Rousse area just to enjoy the",
          "This might be the largest fresco in Europe and it offers a glimpse of a day-to-day life in Lyon. I have enjoyed very much this relaxing experience.",
          "Lyon is full of these huge, painted walls which are quite imposing, but not that well made. You'll definitely notice them if you pass by, but you should not be explicitely looking for them in the city",
          "Although there are quite a few murals in Lyon, this one is the biggest and best. If you have never seen a 3D mural before go and look at this one. It won't take long and is worth the journey.",
          "Don't miss it when visiting Lyon. It is one of the few \"modern\" attractions worth visiting. To get there take the metro C line to Henon station and turn left when exiting the train. Climb the stairs and you will see the wall straight ahead. Metro C line is interesting on its own",
          "We viewed this wall from the hop on hop off bus then went back to have another look. Such detail and wonderful quirky glimpses. We were then delighted to see a similar wall in Quebec executed by the same artists. Great fun!",
          "Although slightly out of the way, if you have the time, it's something that you really need to see. Although only one (very big) wall, the artwork is astonishing. But there are other mural paintings hidden around Lyon.",
          "By the end of our trip, around night, we decided to get up on the hill of La Croix Rousse and looked for Le Mur des Canuts. We were happy to see it but it's nothing extravagant (unless we missed something about it)",
          "I was amazed by these painted buildings, You can hardly tell that the windows are all painted. There are at least four of these buildings that I visited in Lyon. One has famous people, another has books, and another has just ordinary windows. I highly recommend you take the time",
          "Well if you want to go just a little bit outside of the city center, which I recommend in any city you visit, this is a good pick. The wall painting was really nice in 3D and we took a buss there, we prefer bus since you will see more of the city that way.But of course the Henon",
          "This kind of mural is very unusual, I believe many artists, architects and city officials put their hearts and tears on those marvelous murals. It is a must see.",
          "This wall mural is not easy to find. The best way is to take the metro to Henon station and walk back towards Croix- Rousse metro station. There is only 1 road access to Croix Rousse and you will see this mural about 150m fom Henon Metro station. It is really a marvel to watch",
          "I was on a private tour and we walked up with commentary. Go if you have time as there are some picture worthy moments.",
          "It is a bit away from the centre but worth the trip with the subway. Already from a distance you experience how 'real' the painting is. Only when beneath it you realize the real-life size of it all. A must-see in Lyon",
          "These murals are amazing and very realistic. Definitely needs to be seen, especially for the art lovers.",
          "So much work has gone into this, it's changed and been added to over the years and the artwork has got better and better. Easy to find as there is a metro stop nearby.",
          "I went to this spot just to see this wall and was definitely worth it. I combined it by walking though the area and also going to the Ninkasi bar (bar of French special beers). it was like 10 minutes walking from the metro station, so pretty ok and nice walk. Was nicely made, I",
          "We saw these murals on a bus tour, so it was literally a drive-by attraction. It was very interesting, but after I saw it I wasn\u2019t disposed to return for a closer, more leisurely inspection of the artwork. I agree that Le Mur Des Canuts is not a destination attraction like",
          "The one near the Sa\u00f4ne river including all famous characters from the city of Lyon is more interesting, but this one is quite spectacular in its perspective. Worth a look if not a trip",
          "We saw something very similar in Quebec. Lyon was not as impressive but a fun bit of history and well done.",
          "Located not far from Hanon metro station or in the walking distance of Croix Rousse station. It's nice and fun to take a photo of the wall.",
          "We spent about 30 minutes admiring this piece of art. What was interesting in particulat to see how it has changed over time: how the buildings have been renovated as well as the people having got older! From now on, if I see an ugly concrete wall, I'll think of it as a lost",
          "One of several murals in Lyon, this one is really impressive. It's the third mural done on this building wall and recognizes the city's silk workers (canuts).",
          "An amazingly realistic, colorful, vibrant work of art. I could spend hours looking at it and admiring the little details. Indeed, I doubled back during my walk in the area just so that I could take one more look. Highly recommended.",
          "While understated, Le Mur Des Canuts is one of the most impressive things to see in Lyon. And like most of the other worthwhile things to see in Lyon, it's easy to get to and it's free.",
          "I think it's worth a little detour to see it. Since it's in a neighborhood with a really good gastronomic offer it would be perfecto for a double plan (eating + sightseeing)",
          "I think it is worth seeing. Left of the wall there are photos of how it looked like in different stages. But the angle in which you approach the location is important. Looking from another angle distorts the perspective and does not look realistic any longer.",
          "Great mural on the side of the buildings. I didn't realise at first that there was a \"legend\" with the names of the people featured in the murals, such as Paul Bocuse, the Lumiere Brothers, Antoine De Saint-Exupery (Le Petit Prince), and lots more. Certainly worth a walk from",
          "It was amazing to see the art of Le Mur Des Canuts. It was very impressing. Everyone who visit Lyon must see the beautiful and living art on the walls",
          "The mur is a 5 minute walk from the tube station. It is really pretty, and well done. Go there in the afternoon to get the best photos...!!",
          "Painted walls are traditionnal old arts in Lyon. You have to go and see one at least. Le mur des canuts is one of the greatest. Taking a picture or a selfie in front of the wall is such a fun. And is free, it's just in the street.",
          "The Mur des Canuts is definitely a little far from the heart of Lyon, but if you catch the metro up the steep hill to get there then it's definitely worth it. The wall is massive and extremely detailed making it look extremely realistic. We also had some fun posing with the",
          "This is a fascinating museum and a morning really well spent. To hear the tragic lives of the silk weavers and the story of silk embroidery weaving is really interesting. Wonderful shop selling gorgeous silk scarves, jackets etc. wonderful engaged attentive staff.",
          "In a lot of European cities now you can find similar paintings this one is impressive, but I'm not so sure it warrants the time to find, if your stay is short. I would much prefer to 'eat' my way through this gastronomic paradise",
          "take C-line metro and get off one block from the mural. So real even fooled me with some of the painting. Shows a construction crane near the top of mural. Didn't realise it was part of painting until about 50 metres away from the wall. Must see while visiting Croix-Rousse.",
          "If you have the time, visit \"Le Mur Des Canuts\", it is basically the back wall of pretty big building which was completely painted with a very realistic scene. You do notice that it is a painting, yet there are parts of the painting where you really question yourself if the wall",
          "Went there with the metro and despite the rain, it is worth the visit. Definitely a good way to make use of a flat wall and make it interesting. Everything was well done and at the real size. Kids love it too and took lots of picts.",
          "We took Metro C to Henon and it is just a short walk to see the wall. What an amazing transformation. From a large, ugly concrete facade a fascinating slice of Lyonnaise life has been depicted in a very creative way. It was interesting to see the progression of the artwork",
          "Le Mur Des Canuts is one of the unique landmarks of Lyon. We stumbled upon it coming down from the hills of Croix-Rousse and I was stunned with the brilliance of the whole idea of this enormous mural. The history of ordinary citizens of Lyon as well as those who made this city",
          "This is a series of buildings where the windows have been switched with pictures. Not totally sure what the point is except as a conversation piece. Some of the pictures carry a message if you study them closely. Spend not more then 10 minutes at this site.",
          "Visited this renowned wall during a short city break, it is truly a hidden gem in the hillside area of Lyon. Make sure you read the history underneath, it really puts everything in perspective. I also enjoyed studying every scene depicted in the mural as each part of the wall",
          "You know what it is from the forums, you approach and still think it is a real and beautiful ending of the boulevard. And then it strikes you, it's nothing more than a painting on a huge wall, like some other in Lyon. It mesmerizes you, everyone wants a picture with the shop or",
          "This is so fun to go see and to try to find everything and figure out who everyone in the painting is. I did research before I went to see it and I spent the better part of the morning looking at every single image and smiling at finding some little bit of a story about Lyon.",
          "We had climbed up the hill to Crois Rousse to find out more about silk weaving in Lyon, and had visited the silk weavers' museum (very interesting). I had read about Le Mur de Canuts and was interested but we were both feeling rather knackered. However I persuaded my husband",
          "A nice piece of public art. Take the metro train to Henon then walk back towards the old lyon area (south). Lots of detail.",
          "The mural is impressive in size and impressive in detail. The timeline of pictures in the little covered way to the left showing its transition from blank wall through three iterations of design over the years is interesting. But how to get there. The MosLyn TopTip\u2122 is to take",
          "I am always dragged to see art on holidays but this I didn't mind going out to! It was amazing, and you could genuinely study it for quite a while, admiring all the details. It's just by the Henon metro stop so easy to get to and definitely worth a trip - if you don't count",
          "Located away from the main tourist area, the mural is definetly worth seeing. The detail is amazing, and like how the scenes are current to today.",
          "Amazing piece of art with some much detail. Highly recommend a walk around Lyon to see the murals all around the city.",
          "Le Mur De Canuts is the largest and most impressive trompe l'oel mural I have ever seen. It provides a detailed view of Lyon street life including people hanging out, a bank, a puppet theater, silk weaving, gardening and faux building details. At the top is an artist studio,",
          "Situated in an unlikely position in a workers' suburb of Lyon, this is a magnificent trompe l'oeil work of art, which turns a blank ugly concrete wall into a whole street scene with amazing skill. It will give you a taste for finding the other painted walls around Lyon which",
          "You think you are coming out of the interesting bit of the Croix Rousse area, when you come upon this huge painted wall. The interest for me was in the scale and the detail, and the fact that the painting has been updated twice, rather than the sheer skill of the trompe d'oeil.",
          "This trompe l\u2019oeil is amazing. It was painted to look like a stairway up between a numbers of buildings. In a tunnel beside it, we read that it was actually the third update on the original. Each update has brought the buildings in line with current buildings in the area and has",
          "This is, in my opinion, the best fresco in Lyon. I did a tour of the different frescos and found this one to be simply outstanding. It's so realistic and the 3d effect with the stairs is amazing.... If you're doing a tour of the frescos I recommend leaving this one til close to",
          "Beautifully executed trompe l'oeil. Well worth seeing. A bit out of town - there are others near the river that are more central but this one is the best .",
          "One of many fine murals in Lyon. From the metro stop I asked a few people how to get to the mural and they helpfully pointed me in the right direction. I enjoyed sitting on the bench facing the mural. Too bad two local boys came and repeatedly kicked a ball against the mural -",
          "We were not looking for this. My wife and I had been walking in Croix-Rousse and decided to just take a random different route back down the hill. This wasn't on our to see list but it should be on yours. This is the best example of a large scale mural (one of the largest)",
          "Le Mur Des Canuts is a very nice evolving piece of modern art. First of all you need to get out in Henon subway station, follow the Boulevard des Canuts sign and when you walk upstairs you see the wall in front of you. It is nice to read the history of the wall. You need to sit",

          "We walked up the hill and the stairs from Lyon to the Croix Rouge area before finally finding this mural. Fortunately, a kindly old lady saw me looking at the map and walked with me the extra three or four blocks to find it. I would recommend taking a taxi to the mural and",
          "There are a number of amazing trope d'oeil murals throughout the city of Lyon the best known being Les Murs de Canuts which is repainted every 10 years showing how the neighborhood has changed. The history of Lyon can be seen by the meals found throughout the city, however",
          "There are a series of trompe l'oeil painted walls in Lyon. I particularly enjoyed the mur des Lyonnais, showing noted citizens through the years. It's a fun way to realize the history of the city, and the contributions of its citizens. The Mur des Canuts is also Interesting.",
          "Definitely visit this and the other murs peints of Lyon if you're anywhere near them. They are magnificent and quintessentially and uniquely Lyonnais. I also recommend le mur des Lyonnais and le mur des \u00e9crivains (both along the Sa\u00f4ne).",
          "There are several murals in Lyon painted by the collective that has gone on to do murals in a multitude of cities. The best is right near the Saone River pedestrian bridge and has many of the major characters from the history of Lyon. Life like and with an amazing use of",
          "Quite amazing and remarkably life like. We rounded a corner and there it was! Depicts life in Lyon and fun to see the various characters going about their day. Worth a visit. Also worth exploring the area as few tourists around. Several other smaller murals around. And it's",
          "I enjoy murals and this one is quite impressive. The size alone makes it worth visiting. Great scene depicting local life in Lyon. The information about the wall history is available. If you don't have a lot of time, just take the metro up to Henon station, it's a two minute",
          "This wall was a little off the beaten tourist path, but worth coming out to see. They update the mural every so often, and it had been re-painted last year. It was really amazing to see up close and personal. You need to see it to believe it!",
          "One of the most impressive of the 'murs peints' of Lyon: well worth the hike to La Croix Rousse, especially if you have a moment to look at the short history of the wall (displayed to the right of the wall as you look at it).",
          "On your visit to the Croix Rousse be sure to stop and visit this masterpiece originally created in the 1970's during an urban renewal project. The Mayor of Lyon at that time made many renewal decisions that I think were disastrous--including demolishing the gorgeous old Halles",
          "We learned a lot but unfortunately missed seeing the machines in that our host told us were on display. We did see the photos and the description though. Another high energy walk up the hill to visit the museum.",

          "What a great way to use plain walls. These murals are very well done and often tell a story, you can play spot the historic, local or international celebrities, some I bet you'll never guess others are easy. We did this as part of a guided tour of Lyon and our guide was great,",
          "We walked all the way long, looking for this amazing trope l'oeil, but you can save time and find it more easily just getting off the funicular at Croix Rousse. This impressive artwork depicts the ordinary life of Lyonnais people. The optical illusion offered by the 3D painting",
          "These paintings depict the lives of people of Lyon. This beautiful town will teach you that time is life's most precious luxury.",
          "Took a dozen photos of this very clever display of art. Recognized many of the people and loved the key once we found it. Exciting game of naming whos who and great execution by the artists.",
          "I started from metro Henon and made my way down. The signs pointing to Mur peint at the junction of Blvd des Canuts and Denfert Rochereau are quite cleareally. Remember to take picture with the adorable girl sitting on the steps.",

          "Most people that want to explore the new city, get off the funicular at Croix Rousse . Actually that was the starting point of the self audio guided tour that I picked from the Tourist Information kiosk. Well, my advise is to get off the next station, Henon, if you want to",
          "Purchased City Card for the day allowing access to transportation and museums ... so took opportunity to take subway out to see wall. A block away from exit to subway this work of art was so realistic we too walked towards corner before realizing what it was. Great photo op.",
          "Stumbled across this on an evening stroll. Impressive artwork depicting different individuals from throughout the history of Lyon.",
          "Don't miss this. Take the metro to the Henon station and walk down from there. It's easier than walking uphill from the Croix Rousse station which is what the guide books recommend",
          "This huge trompe l'oeil painting made by professional street artists depicts life in the neighbourhood. It is beautiful to see and its story is fascinating. The painting has a \"shelf life\" of 10 years so they repaint it every decade to make sure it evolves. Excellent guided tour",
          "Very nice wall art which depicts a slide of daily lyonnaise life. It's quite real too given that the art covers the WHOLE building. I had fun interacting with the different characters on the street level and taking pictures with them :)",
          "As you approach the wall it is really hard to tell it's just paint and not the real thing, well done.",
          "We could not beleive thsi mural was on a flat wall, it was so realistically 3D. Huge and really impressive, it was well worth finding, even though it is not in the centre of Lyon. It is only a short walk from the metro station at Henon.",
          "I've seen a mural like this in Quebec City and the Mur des Canuts is just as impressive, but different because it's more than one large mural - it's spread out throughout a small area on a few buildings. Some look pretty realistic from afar!",
          "Some great paintings that look very realistic at points throughout. It is an interesting curiosity that is worth the time to take a look at when you are on a site seeing tour of Lyon.",
          "This wall is beautiful, and has been updated as time goes on to be relevant to the modern day. The wall itself is very realistic, and you can scarcely tell that it is a painting when looking back at photos! Just by the side of the wall are some pictures of the past paintings,",
          "An interesting addition to the neighborhood and an interesting progression of history explained in English and French to the side. A nicely done work, impressively designed and executed and no grafitti in sight!",
          "The biggest wall painting in Europe , just 3 metro stations from the hotel the ville, 1 minute walking from the Hennon station, line C. Beatifull and impressive. The kids really enjoyed it and we felt the same. It has so many details and it is very colorful. Nothing else to",

          "The silk museum is in a very unassuming building, but the information is fascinating. My husband & I took the metro to the closest stop. Which was a good thing as that part of Lyon is situated at the top of a hill. The museum tells the history of the silk industry in Lyon. Try",
          "I had no idea what expect when the B&B owner told me it was worth looking at. An ugly street corner has been turned into a work of art. It is not the only mural in the city, \"Fresque des Lyonnais\" is also very impressive. Don't miss this if you visit lyon.",

          "It is only a wall with a painting on it, but the painting is so realistic! It's amazing how they have done it and made it all into proportion. I actually had to walk right up to the wall to check it wasn't really 3D!",
          "It is worth it to go to La Croix Rousse...take the walking tour recommended in the Michelin Guide. The whole area is very nice, out of the standard tourist route. Just taking the Metro/cog Railway from H\u00f4tel de Ville is worth it. The Mur des Canuts is a bonus. Well worth",

          "I just do not understand what all the fuss is about. Ok, the painter/painters must have been talented. And yes, the wall looks quite nice from far away. But, if that is all Lyon has to offer as an attraction, that is really sad. I saw a tour-bus parked in front of the wall",

        "wiki": "Lyon or Lyons (UK: , US: , French: [lj\u0254\u0303] (listen); Arpitan: Liyon, pronounced [\u028ej\u0254\u0303]; Italian: Lione, pronounced [li\u02c8one]) is the third-largest city and second-largest urban area of France. It is located at the confluence of the rivers Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne, about 470 km (292 mi) south of Paris, 320 km (199 mi) north of Marseille and 56 km (35 mi) northeast of Saint-\u00c9tienne. Inhabitants of the city are called Lyonnais.\nLyon had a population of 513,275 in 2015. It is the capital of the Metropolis of Lyon and the region of Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes. The Lyon metropolitan area had a population of 2,265,375 in 2014. The city is known for its cuisine and gastronomy, and historical and architectural landmarks; part of it is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Lyon was historically an important area for the production and weaving of silk. Lyon played a significant role in the history of cinema: it is where Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re invented the cinematograph. It is also known for its light festival, the F\u00eate des Lumi\u00e8res, which begins every 8 December and lasts for four days, earning Lyon the title of Capital of Lights.\nEconomically, Lyon is a major centre for banking, as well as for the chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotech industries. The city contains a significant software industry with a particular focus on video games, and in recent years has fostered a growing local start-up sector. Lyon hosts the international headquarters of Interpol, the International Agency for Research on Cancer and Euronews. According to the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute, Lyon is considered a Beta city, as of 2018. It ranked second in France and 40th globally in Mercer's 2019 liveability rankings.\n\n\n== History of Lyon ==\n\n\n=== Ancient Lyon ===\n\nAccording to the historian Dio Cassius, in 43 BC, the Roman Senate ordered the creation of a settlement for Roman refugees of war with the Allobroges. These refugees had been expelled from Vienne and were now encamped at the confluence of the Sa\u00f4ne and Rh\u00f4ne rivers. The foundation was built on Fourvi\u00e8re hill and officially called Colonia Copia Felix Munatia, a name invoking prosperity and the blessing of the gods. The city became increasingly referred to as Lugdunum (and occasionally Lugudunum). The earliest translation of this Gaulish place-name as \"Desired Mountain\" is offered by the 9th-century Endlicher Glossary. In contrast, some modern scholars have proposed a Gaulish hill-fort named Lug[o]dunon, after the Celtic god Lugus ('Light', cognate with Old Irish Lugh, Modern Irish L\u00fa), and d\u00fanon (hill-fort).\n\nThe Romans recognised that Lugdunum's strategic location at the convergence of two navigable rivers made it a natural communications hub. The city became the starting point of main Roman roads in the area, and it quickly became the capital of the province, Gallia Lugdunensis. Two Emperors were born in this city: Claudius, whose speech is preserved in the Lyon Tablet in which he justifies the nomination of Gallic Senators, and Caracalla.\nEarly Christians in Lyon were martyred for their beliefs under the reigns of various Roman emperors, most notably Marcus Aurelius and Septimius Severus. Local saints from this period include Blandina, Pothinus, and Epipodius, among others. The Greek Irenaeus was the second bishop of Lyon during the latter part of the second century. To this day, the archbishop of Lyon is still referred to as \"Primat des Gaules\".Burgundians fleeing the destruction of Worms by the Huns in 437 were re-settled at Lugdunum. In 443 the Romans established the Kingdom of the Burgundians, and Lugdunum became its capital in 461. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, Lyon went to the Holy Roman Emperor Lothair I. It later was made part of the Kingdom of Arles. Lyon did not come under French control until the 14th century.\n\n\n=== Modern Lyon ===\nFernand Braudel remarked, \"Historians of Lyon are not sufficiently aware of the bi-polarity between Paris and Lyon, which is a constant structure in French development...from the late Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution\". In the late 15th century, the fairs introduced by Italian merchants made Lyon the economic counting house of France. Even the Bourse (treasury), built in 1749, resembled a public bazaar where accounts were settled in the open air. When international banking moved to Genoa, then Amsterdam, Lyon remained the banking centre of France.\nDuring the Renaissance, the city's development was driven by the silk trade, which strengthened its ties to Italy. Italian influence on Lyon's architecture is still visible among historic buildings. In the late 1400s and 1500s Lyon was also a key centre of literary activity and book publishing, both of French writers (such as Maurice Sc\u00e8ve, Antoine Heroet, and Louise Lab\u00e9) and of Italians in exile (such as Luigi Alamanni and Gian Giorgio Trissino).\n\nIn 1572, Lyon was a scene of mass violence by Catholics against Protestant Huguenots in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. Two centuries later, Lyon was again convulsed by violence when, during the French Revolution, the citizenry rose up against the National Convention and supported the Girondins. The city was besieged by Revolutionary armies for over two months before surrendering in October 1793. Many buildings were destroyed, especially around the Place Bellecour, while Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois and Joseph Fouch\u00e9 administered the execution of more than 2,000 people. The Convention ordered that its name be changed to \"Liberated City\" and a plaque was erected that proclaimed \"Lyons made war on Liberty; Lyons no longer exists.\" A decade later, Napoleon ordered the reconstruction of all the buildings demolished during this period.\nThe Convention was not the only target within Lyon during the 1789-1799 French Revolution. After the National Convention faded into history, the French Directory appeared and days after the September 4, 1797, Coup of 18 Fructidor, a Directory's commissioner was assassinated in Lyon.\nThe city became an important industrial town during the 19th century. In 1831 and 1834, the canuts (silk workers) of Lyon staged two major uprisings for better working conditions and pay. In 1862, the first of Lyon's extensive network of funicular railways began operation.\nDuring World War II, Lyon was a centre for the occupying Nazi forces, including Klaus Barbie, the infamous \"Butcher of Lyon\". But the city was also a stronghold of the French Resistance \u2013 the many secret passages known as traboules enabled people to escape Gestapo raids. On 3 September 1944, Lyon was liberated by the 1st Free French Division and the Forces Fran\u00e7aises de l'Int\u00e9rieur. The city is now home to a resistance museum.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne converge to the south of the historic city centre, forming a peninsula \u2013 the \"Presqu'\u00eele\" \u2013 bounded by two large hills to the west and north and a large plain eastward. Place Bellecour is located on the Presqu'\u00eele between the two rivers and is the third-largest public square in France. The broad, pedestrian-only Rue de la R\u00e9publique leads north from Place Bellecour.\nThe northern hill is La Croix-Rousse, known as \"the hill that works\" because it is traditionally home to many small silk workshops, an industry for which the city has long been renowned.The western hill is Fourvi\u00e8re, known as \"the hill that prays\" because it is the location for Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re basilica, several convents, and Archbishop residence. The district, Vieux Lyon, also hosts the Tour m\u00e9tallique (a highly visible TV tower, replicating the last stage of the Eiffel Tower) and one of the city's funicular railways. Fourvi\u00e8re, along with portions of the Presqu'\u00eele and much of La Croix-Rousse, is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.East of the Rh\u00f4ne from the Presqu'\u00eele is a large flat area upon which sits much of modern Lyon and contains most of the city's population. Situated in this area is La Part-Dieu urban centre, which clusters the landmark structures Tour Part-Dieu, Tour Oxyg\u00e8ne, and Tour Swiss Life, as well as the city's primary railway station, Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu.\nNorth of this district lays the sixth arrondissement, which is home to one of Europe's largest urban parks, the Parc de la T\u00eate d'or, as well as Lyc\u00e9e du Parc and Interpol's world headquarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLyon has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), bordering on an oceanic climate (Cfb) due to the higher average temperature being around 22 \u00b0C. But in modified classifications such as that of Trewartha, France's third largest city has an oceanic climate (Do).  The mean temperature in Lyon in the coldest month is 3.2 \u00b0C (37.8 \u00b0F) in January and in the warmest month in July is 22 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Precipitation is adequate year-round, at an average of 830 mm (32.7 in), but the winter months are the driest. The highest recorded temperature was 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) on 13 August 2003 while the lowest recorded temperature was \u221224.6 \u00b0C (\u221212.3 \u00b0F) on 22 December 1938.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nLike Paris and Marseille, the city of Lyon is divided into a number of municipal arrondissements, each of which is identified by a number and has its own council and town hall. Five arrondissements were originally created in 1852, when three neighbouring communes (La Croix-Rousse, La Guilloti\u00e8re, and Vaise) were annexed by Lyon. Between 1867 and 1959, the third arrondissement (which originally covered the whole of the Left Bank of the Rh\u00f4ne) was split three times, creating a new arrondissement in each case. Then, in 1963, the commune of Saint-Rambert-l'\u00cele-Barbe was annexed to Lyon's fifth arrondissement. A year later, in 1964, the fifth was split to create Lyon's 9th \u2013 and, to date, final \u2013 arrondissement. Within each arrondissement, the recognisable quartiers or neighbourhoods are:\n\n1st arrondissement: Slopes of La Croix-Rousse, Terreaux, Martini\u00e8re/St-Vincent\n2nd arrondissement: Cordeliers, Bellecour, Ainay, Perrache, Confluence, Sainte-Blandine\n3rd arrondissement: Guilloti\u00e8re (north), Pr\u00e9fecture, Part-Dieu, Villette, Dauphin\u00e9/Sans Souci, Montchat, Grange Blanche (north), Monplaisir (north)\n4th arrondissement: Plateau de la Croix-Rousse, Serin\n5th arrondissement: Vieux Lyon (Saint-Paul, Saint-Jean, Saint-Georges), Saint-Just, Saint-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e, Fourvi\u00e8re, Point du Jour, M\u00e9nival, Batti\u00e8res, Champvert (south)\n6th arrondissement: Brotteaux, Bellecombe, Parc de la T\u00eate d'or, Cit\u00e9 Internationale\n7th arrondissement: Guilloti\u00e8re (south), Jean Mac\u00e9, Gerland\n8th arrondissement: Monplaisir (south), Bachut, \u00c9tats-Unis, Grand Trou/Moulin \u00e0 Vent, Grange Blanche (south), La\u00ebnnec, Mermoz, Monplaisir-la-Plaine\n9th arrondissement: Vaise, Duch\u00e8re, Rochecardon, St-Rambert-l'\u00cele-Barbe, Gorge de Loup, Observance, Champvert (north)Geographically, Lyon's two main rivers, the Sa\u00f4ne and the Rh\u00f4ne, divide the arrondissements into three groups:\n\nTo the west of the Sa\u00f4ne, the fifth arrondissement covers the old city (Vieux Lyon), Fourvi\u00e8re hill and the plateau beyond. The 9th is immediately to the north, and stretches from Gorge de Loup, through Vaise to the neighbouring suburbs of \u00c9cully, Champagne-au-Mont-d'Or, Saint-Didier-au-Mont-d'Or, Saint-Cyr-au-Mont-d'Or and Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or.\nBetween the two rivers, on the Presqu'\u00eele, are the second, first, and fourth arrondissements. The second includes most of the city centre,  Bellecour and Perrache railway station, and reaches as far as the confluence of the two rivers. The first is directly to the north of the second and covers part of the city centre (including the H\u00f4tel de Ville) and the slopes of La Croix-Rousse. To the north of the Boulevard is the fourth arrondissement, which covers the Plateau of La Croix-Rousse, up to its boundary with the commune of Caluire-et-Cuire.\nTo the east of the Rh\u00f4ne, are the third, sixth, seventh, and eighth arrondissements.\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nThe Roman ruins on the hillside near the Fourvi\u00e8re Basilica, with the Ancient Theatre of Fourvi\u00e8re, the Odeon of Lyon and the accompanying Gallo-Roman museum;\nAmphitheatre of the Three Gauls \u2013 ruins of a Roman amphitheatre.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===\nCathedral of St. John, a medieval church with architectural elements of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, also the principal religious structure in the city and the seat of the Archbishop of Lyon;\nBasilica of St-Martin-d'Ainay, one of the rare surviving Romanesque basilica-style churches in Lyon;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Paul, Romanesque (12th and 13th century) and Gothic (15th\u201316th century) church;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Bonaventure, 14th- and 15th-century Gothic church;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Nizier, Gothic church from the 15th century, having a doorway carved in the 16th century by Philibert Delorme;\nVieux Lyon (English: Old Lyon) area, Medieval and Renaissance quarter of the town, with shops, dining and cobbled streets;\nThe many Renaissance h\u00f4tels particuliers of the Old Lyon quarter, such as the H\u00f4tel de Bullioud, were also built by Philibert Delorme.\n\n\n=== 17th and 18th centuries ===\nCity Hall on the Place des Terreaux, built by architects Jules Hardouin-Mansart and Robert de Cotte;\nMus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Lyon, fine arts museum housed in a former convent of the 17th century, including the Baroque chapelle Saint-Pierre;\nH\u00f4tel-Dieu de Lyon (17th and 18th century), historical hospital with a baroque chapel;\nTemple du Change (17th and 18th century), former stock exchange of Lyon, Protestant temple since the 18th century;\nPlace Bellecour, one of the largest town squares in Europe;\nChapelle de la Trinit\u00e9 (1622), the first Baroque chapel built in Lyon, and part of the former \u00c9cole de la Trinit\u00e9, now Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Amp\u00e8re;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Polycarpe (1665\u20131670), Classical church;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Just (16th to 18th century), Classical church;\nSaint-Bruno des Chartreux (17th and 18th century), church, masterpiece of Baroque architecture;\n\u00c9glise Notre Dame Saint-Vincent (18th century), Neo-classical church.\n\n\n=== 19th century and modern city ===\nOp\u00e9ra Nouvel (1831), renovated in 1993 by Jean Nouvel;\nTh\u00e9\u00e2tre des C\u00e9lestins (1877), designed by Gaspard Andr\u00e9;\nBasilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re, large 19th-century basilica on the top of Fourvi\u00e8re Hill;\nTour m\u00e9tallique de Fourvi\u00e8re (1894);\nLa Mouche Cattle Market and Abbatoir (1914, 1928), designed by Tony Garnier;\nSainte Marie de La Tourette monastery (1960) designed by Le Corbusier;\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry International Airport (formerly Satolas Airport), designed by Guillaume Gilbert;\nGare de Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (1994) by Santiago Calatrava;\nPalais des congr\u00e8s de Lyon (1998), designed by Renzo Piano and a group of buildings for various functions;\nTour du Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais;\nTour Oxyg\u00e8ne;\nTour Incity.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Lyon (Fine Arts Museum), main museum of the city and one of the largest art galleries in France.

Located in the 6th arrondissement, it features a large lake on which boating takes place during the summer months.\nJardin botanique de Lyon (8 hectares), included in the Parc de la T\u00eate d'Or, is a municipal botanical garden and is open weekdays without charge. The garden was established in 1857 as a successor to earlier botanical gardens dating to 1796, and now describes itself as France's largest municipal botanical garden.\nParc de Gerland, in the south of the city (80 hectares);\nParc des hauteurs, in Fourvi\u00e8res;\nParc de Miribel-Jonage (2200 hectares);\nParc de Lacroix-Laval (115 hectares);\nParc de Parilly (178 hectares).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe GDP of Lyon was 74 billion euro in 2012, making it the second richest city in France after Paris. Lyon and its region Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes represent one of the most important economies in Europe and, according to Loughborough University, can be compared to Philadelphia, Mumbai or Athens with regard to its international position. The city of Lyon is working in partnership to more easily enable the establishment of new headquarters in the territory (ADERLY, Chambre du commerce et d'industrie, Grand Lyon...). High-tech industries such as biotechnology, software development, video game (Arkane Studios, Ivory Tower, Eden Games, EA France, Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe), and internet services are also growing. Other important sectors include medical research and technology, non-profit institutions, and universities. Lyon is home to the P4-Inserm\u2013ean Merieux Laboratory which conducts top-level vaccine research.The city is home to the headquarters of many large companies such as Groupe SEB, Sanofi Pasteur, Renault Trucks, Norbert Dentressangle, LCL S.A., Descours & Cabaud, Merial, Point S, BioM\u00e9rieux, Iveco Bus, Compagnie Nationale du Rh\u00f4ne, GL Events, April Group, Boiron, Feu Vert, Panzani, Babolat, Euronews, Lyon Airports, LVL Medical, and inter-governmental agencies IARC, Interpol.\nThe specialisation of some sectors of activities has led to the creation of many main business centres:\nLa Part-Dieu, located in the 3rd arrondissement is the second biggest business quarter after La D\u00e9fense in Paris with over 1,600,000 m2 (17,222,256.67 sq ft) of office space and services and more than 55,000 jobs. Cit\u00e9 Internationale, created by the architect Renzo Piano is located in the border of the Parc de la T\u00eate d'Or in the 6th arrondissement. The worldwide headquarters of Interpol is located there. The district of Confluence, in the south of the historic centre, is a new pole of economical and cultural development.\nTourism is an important part of the Lyon economy, with one billion euros in 2007 and 3.5 million hotel-nights in 2006 provided by non-residents. Approximately 60% of tourists visit for business, with the rest for leisure. In January 2009, Lyon ranked first in France for hostels business. The festivals most important for attracting tourists are the F\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res, the Nuits de Fourvi\u00e8re every summer, the Biennale d'art contemporain and the Nuits Sonores.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nSince the Middle Ages, the region residents have spoken several dialects of Franco-Proven\u00e7al. The Lyonnais dialect was replaced by the French language as the importance of the city grew. However some \"frenchified\" Franco-Proven\u00e7al words can also be heard in the French of the Lyonnais, who call their little boys and girls \"gones\" and \"fenottes\" for example.\nThe Lumi\u00e8re brothers pioneered cinema in the town in 1895. The Institut Lumi\u00e8re, built as Auguste Lumiere's house, and a fascinating piece of architecture in its own right, holds many of their first inventions and other early cinematic and photographic artifacts.\n8 December each year is marked by the Festival of Lights (la F\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res), a celebration of thanks to the Virgin Mary, who purportedly saved the city from a deadly plague in the Middle Ages. During the event, the local population places candles (lumignons) at their windows and the city of Lyon organizes impressive large-scale light shows onto the sides of important Lyonnais monuments, such as the medieval Cath\u00e9drale St-Jean.\nThe Saint Francis of Sales church is famous for its large and unaltered Cavaill\u00e9-Coll pipe organ, attracting audiences from around the world.\nThe Op\u00e9ra Nouvel (New Opera House) is the home of the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon. The original opera house was re-designed by the distinguished French architect Jean Nouvel between 1985 and 1993 and is named after him.\nLyon is also the French capital of \"trompe l'\u0153il\" walls, a very ancient tradition. Many are to be seen around the city. This old tradition is now finding a contemporary expression, for example in the art of Guillaume Bottazzi.\nThe Brothers of the Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic congregation that operates schools in Europe and North America, was founded in Lyon in 1821.\nThe African Museum of Lyon is one of the oldest museums situated in Lyon.\nThe Museum of Resistance and Deportation looks at the various individuals prominent in the Resistance movement in World War II. The building is strongly linked to Klaus Barbie. Lyon sees itself as the center of the French resistance and many members were shot in Place Bellecour in the town center. The exhibition is largely a series of mini-biographies of those involved.\nThe unusual project Lyon Dubai City, a reproduction of some districts of Lyon in Dubai, is a major point for tourism in Lyon.\nLyon is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission Intercultural cities program.\n\n\n=== UNESCO World Heritage Site ===\nThe Historic Site of Lyon was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998. In its designation, UNESCO cited the \"exceptional testimony to the continuity of urban settlement over more than two millennia on a site of great commercial and strategic significance.\" The specific regions comprising the Historic Site include the Roman district and Fourvi\u00e8re, the Renaissance district (Vieux Lyon), the silk district (slopes of Croix-Rousse), and the Presqu'\u00eele, which features architecture from the 12th century to modern times.\nBoth Vieux Lyon and the slopes of Croix-Rousse are known for their narrow passageways (named traboules) that pass through buildings and link streets on either side. The first examples of traboules are thought to have been built in Lyon in the 4th century. The traboules allowed the inhabitants to get from their homes to the Sa\u00f4ne quickly and allowed the canuts on the Croix-Rousse hill to get from their workshops to the textile merchants at the foot of the hill.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\n\nLyon has a long and chronicled culinary arts tradition. The noted food critic Curnonsky referred to the city as \"the gastronomic capital of the world\", a claim repeated by later writers such as Bill Buford.  Renowned 3-star Michelin chefs such as Marie Bourgeois and Eug\u00e9nie Brazier developed Lyonnaise cuisine into a national phenomenon favoured by the French elite; a tradition which Paul Bocuse later turned into a worldwide success.The bouchon is a traditional Lyonnais restaurant that serves local fare such as sausages, duck p\u00e2t\u00e9 or roast pork, along with local wines. Two of France's best known wine-growing regions are located near the city: the Beaujolais region to the north and the C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne region to the south.  Another Lyon tradition is a type of brunch food called \"m\u00e2chons\", made of local charcuterie and usually accompanied by Beaujolais red wine. M\u00e2chons were the customary meal of the canuts, the city's silk workers, who ate a late-morning meal after they finished their shifts in the factories.Other traditional local dishes include coq au vin; quenelle; gras double; salade lyonnaise (lettuce with bacon, cro\u00fbtons and a poached egg); and the sausage-based rosette lyonnaise and andouillette. Popular local confections include marron glac\u00e9 and coussin de Lyon. Cervelle de canut (literally, \"silk worker's brains\") is a cheese spread/dip made of a base of fromage blanc, seasoned with chopped herbs, shallots, salt, pepper, olive oil and vinegar.\nMore recently, the french tacos was invented in Lyon suburbs in the early 2000s and is now worldwide famous.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nLyon is home to the football club Olympique Lyonnais (OL), whose men's team plays in Ligue 1 and has won the championship of that competition seven times, all consecutively from 2002 to 2008). OL played until December 2015 at the 43,000-seat Stade de Gerland, which also hosted matches of the 1998 FIFA World Cup.  Since 2016, the team has played at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais, a 59,000-seat stadium located in the eastern suburb of D\u00e9cines-Charpieu. OL operates a women's team, Olympique Lyonnais F\u00e9minin, which competes in and dominates Division 1 F\u00e9minine. They are on a streak of 13 top-flight championships (2007\u2013present), and additionally claim the four titles won by the original incarnation of FC Lyon, a women's football club that merged into OL in 2004 (the current FC Lyon was founded in 2009). The OL women have also won the UEFA Women's Champions League six times, including the two most recent editions in 2018 and 2019. Lyon will host the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Semi-Finals as well as the 7 July Final at Stade de Lyon.\nLyon has a rugby union team, Lyon OU, in the Top 14, which moved into Stade de Gerland full-time in 2017\u201318. In addition, Lyon has a rugby league side called Lyon Villeurbanne that plays in the French rugby league championship. The club's home is the Stade Georges Lyvet in Villeurbanne.\nLyon is also home to the Lyon Hockey Club, an ice hockey team that competes in France's national ice hockey league. The Patinoire Charlemagne is the seat of Club des Sports de Glace de Lyon, the club of Olympic ice dancing champions Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, and world champions Isabelle Delobel and Olivier Shoenfelder.

It was formed in 1987. It serves Japanese expatriate children who wish to continue their Japanese education whilst abroad.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nLyon\u2013Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport, located east of Lyon, serves as a base for domestic and international flights. It is a key transport facility for the entire Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, with coach links to other cities in the area. The in-house train station Gare de Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry connects the airport to the nationwide TGV network. The Rh\u00f4nexpress tram monopoly links the airport with the business quarter of La Part Dieu in less than 30 minutes, and offers connections with Underground A & B, Tramway T1, T3 & T4, and bus lines. Lyon public transport Sytral offers a bus service, Route 47, that links the airport to Meyzieu where passengers can change onto Tram T3. The regular price of public transport is \u20ac1.90, as opposed to \u20ac15 one way for the Rhonexpress. In the suburb of Bron, the smaller Lyon-Bron Airport provides an alternative for domestic aviation.\nLyon has two major railway stations: Lyon Part-Dieu, which was built to accommodate the TGV, and Lyon Perrache, an older station that now provides mostly regional service. Smaller railway stations include Gorge-de-Loup, Vaise, V\u00e9nissieux, Saint-Paul and Jean Mac\u00e9. Lyon was the first city to be connected to Paris by the TGV in 1981. Since that time the TGV train network has expanded and links Lyon directly to Perpignan, Toulouse, Nice, Marseille, Strasbourg, Nantes and Lille. International trains operate directly to Madrid, Barcelona, Milan, Turin, Geneva, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Brussels and London.\nThe city is at the heart of a dense road network and is located at the meeting point of several highways: A6 (to Paris); A7 (to Marseille); A42 (to Geneva); and A43 (to Grenoble). The city is now bypassed by the A46. A double motorway tunnel passes under Fourvi\u00e8re, connecting the A6 and the A7 autoroutes, both forming the \"Autoroute du Soleil\".\nLyon is served by the Eurolines intercity coach organisation. Its Lyon terminal is located at the city's Perrache railway station, which serves as an intermodal transportation hub for tramways, local and regional trains and buses, the terminus of Metro line A, of the Tramway T2, the bicycle service V\u00e9lo'v, and taxis.\n\nThe Transports en commun lyonnais (TCL), Lyon's public transit system, consisting of metro, tramways and buses, serves 62 communes of the Lyon metropolis. The metro network has four lines ( A   B   C   D ), 42 stations, and runs with a frequency of up to a train every 2 minutes. There are five Lyon tram lines ( T1  T2  T3  T4  T5) since April 2009: T1 from Debourg in the south to IUT-Feyssine in the north, Tram T2 from Perrache railway station to Saint-Priest in the south-east, Tram T3 from Part-Dieu to Meyzieu, Tram T4 from 'H\u00f4ptial Feyzin Venissieux' to Gaston Berger. Tram T5 from Grange Blanche, in the south-east to Eurexpo in the south-wast. The Lyon bus network consists of the Lyon trolleybus system, motorbuses, and coaches for areas outside the centre. There are also two funicular lines from Vieux Lyon to Saint-Just and Fourvi\u00e8re. The ticketing system is relatively simple as the city has only one public transport operator, the SYTRAL.\nThe public transit system has been complemented since 2005 by V\u00e9lo'v, a bicycle network providing a low-cost service where bicycles can be hired and returned at any of 340 stations throughout the city.  Borrowing a bicycle for less than 30 minutes is free. Free rental time can be extended for another 30 minutes at any station. Lyon was the first city in France to introduce this bicycle renting system. In 2011 the Auto'lib car rental service was introduced; it works much the same way as the Velo'v but for cars.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Lyon on a weekday is 45 minutes. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 17% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.7 km, while 4% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLyon is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission \"Intercultural cities\" program.\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nLyon is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGallia Lugdunensis\nList of movies set in Lyon\nList of people from Lyon\nList of streets and squares in Lyon\nM\u00e8res of France\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website(in French)\nVisit Lyon, the official website for tourism in France\nLyon Tourist Office and Convention Bureau\nLyon\u2019s English Language News and Information",

          "Completely unexpected inside given its outside appearance and location. The most extraordinary food stalls/shops, most accompanied by a small restaurant. A great way to sample Lyons famous food culture.",
          "Their website says open on Mondays, but this applies to the restaurants. The shopping was limited to half a dozen places only. Will come back on another occasion. In the meantime their website sent me on a three hour round-trip to no purpose, hence the poor rating. Just be",

          "This was a very enjoyable experience. Our guide with Original Food Tours was friendly, informative, and very considerate of my eight-year-old granddaughter. It was interesting to learn some of the historical backgrounds that created Lyon\u2019s reputation for fine food. I was",

          "Lots of interesting food but very touristic and somehow expensive....anyways a lot of food to see...and always good for a coffee",
          "We went here to get some tasty things for the park. You can also enjoy good food here at some stands. Super nice big hall with lots of choice of very tasty things. You get good advice about cheeses and meat even if you don't speak French. We have achieved wonderful things here",

          "Our family could be discribed as 'foodies' and this was foodie heaven. Almost too many fantastic looking stalls selling the most amazing fresh produce. So good that we came back again the next day and did it all again",

          "This is definitely worth a tour as the variety of products is extensive. This is a learning experience about quality produce, seafood and meat. There are also bakery stands and chocolate merchants as well as restaurants and cooking classes. A must see in Lyon.",

It is a well laid out market with lots of places to have lunch. Lots of competition so the prices are reasonable. This is not a cheap market to buy food",

          "Whilst in Lyon, I took the opportunity to spent a little time in Les Halles. It was a gastronomic dream. It is packed with high quality eateries and food stalls. Even having eaten nothing, I felt 30 pounds heavier on leaving from just looking at the produce available.",
          "So this is obligatory in a short visit to Lyon and who am I to argue? Gorgeous cheese, meat, seafood, chocolates all sumptuously displayed with opportunity to taste the best cooking in town. What more can you ask of a short break in Lyon?",
          "Saturday morning at this market was very interesting. A fabulous selection of food to take home and also restaurants for lunch. We chose a little seafood restaurant and enjoyed fresh oysters, prawns and octopus as well as a very good glass of wine. Most of the diners were",
          "The quality and selection in this Food Market is amazing. We had a great experience seeing and tasting the various food on offer. We ended up having a seafood lunch of fresh oyster and sea urchin. Absolutely delightful!",
          "Seriously, you should visit this hall because it is included with variety of foods and observe the food culture of Lyonnais.",
          "Seriously, go here. Eat, drink, try new things, eat new food, and rejoice that you are in the epicenter of Western foodie culture. So much cheese, so many chocolates! Wander and enjoy yourself.",
          "Highly recommend a visit. There is everything you need for a great day of snacking all the way to perfect meal preparation in this food hall. You can find the worlds highest rated chicken and Waygu beef, the wine to pair with the menu and desserts to finish you off all in one",
          "The hall is totally amazing! The seafood, charcuterie, chocolate and everything. It is a great world of food and tastes. We went with my children, it is the first time they tried oysters and the best for me.",
          "What a wonderful experience--every possible gourmet delicacy all under one roof. Many of the purveyors have small tables/spots where you can enjoy their products so come hungry, you will leave over-stuffed! We visited using an organized tour, which was wonderful as we always",
          "Great experience, worth the walk from the old town, a foodie heaven. We had patanega and Spanish cheese, the service was not great but the food was. Best tip is to speak with an American accent to get the best service! The waitress waiter assumes you will tip well\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude02",
          "Excellent food market, you can buy or eat, don\u2019t miss, you need at least half day for enjoying from all",
          "Entering the Halles make you feel like a kid in a toy shop !!!! Every single display is close to a work of art and the outstanding quality is matched by an identical level of professionalism from the sales team. You are feeling the passion, the respect to the products being",
          "Amazing place with excellent food. You meet not only tourists here but locals as well enjoying the variety of food in excellent and fresh quality.",
          "Market with several options for buying cheeses, cold cuts, fish and seafood and assorted meats. It is possible to taste seafood, oysters and seafood in small restaurants or in a small food court that is served by the local fishmongers. It is the right place for fantastic sweets,",
          "What a great memorial to Paul Bocuse- so many perfect French cuisine experiences housed in this food temple. We cruised and admired and then opted for a dozen oyster that were beyond fresh and delicious coupled with a gorgeous white wine, crunchy buttered baguette and what else",
          "Would highly recommend this place - service is friendly & efficient across all establishments. A lot of traditional French food and all around a good time!",
          "As Lyon is the culinary capital of France, this place is a must visit while in the city. It is not a very big market, but all the suppliers are of high quality. A perfect place to enjoy a delicious lunch as well.",
          "The food here was fantastic! While the options were limited to only French food / cuisine (i.e. unlike the more 'International' food markets like Borough market), you're probably in Lyon to enjoy what the locals have to offer anyways. The prices for hot food / eating-in were",
          "If you love food, you will love this place. What can one say, they have everything, the quality is exceptional and the only problem is that you have to burn the calories somehow. Seafood, cakes, breads, cheeses, meats, veg, fruit, chocolates...yummy.",
          "The best Time to GO is probably on Saturday evening, around 6.30 pm. The place is quiet and it is easy to Walk and enjoy to watch the best traiteurs from Lyon. Most of the traiteurs\u2019 also propose some seats to have diner and especially try Hu\u00eetres",
          "High quality and delicious food on display from many artisan producers, many places to stop and dine with a great variety of artisan foods.Well worth a visit!",
          "You can walk a long time throughout the aisle, enjoying the different magazines with all types of french special foods?! In great to buy and eat french meals!! It is a must in Lyon!!",
          "This is one of the most famous places to eat in LYON. There are quite a few options of restaurants. Vast majority offer French food as their main dish. Prices are a bit expensive, but the food is good. It is worth a visit. Go during the week, cause the weekends are packed.",
          "Very nice food market with many different types of cheese, meats, and vegetables. It also has several restaurants but make sure you get there early.",
          "Very nicely situated grand hall in which one can find all the famous dishes of Lyon. From cheese varieties to meat and chicken. A great variety of patisserie selection. Pasta and pizza.....Wine, beer, champaigne. Vast selection of fish and vegetables... you can either purchase",
          "Not much to be said five star for everything. Just blooming marvellous an experience to last. If you like good food prepared by people that know then this is a place for you. Never have seen Hams and Cheese plus everything that great about Lyon and France. Plus the odd yellow",
          "It\u2019s our first visit to Lyon and our first stop was to this amazing place! There are so many choices and the food quality is top! No words for it, it\u2019s a MUST visit place and we will definitely go again!",
          "Made our way out to the food hall as it was opening and were able to get breakfast and our lunch from the stalls as they opened. Amazingly fresh and delicious food and goodies available at every stall. Spoilt for choice. Just remember to bring cash otherwise an absolute must",
          "Love this market. A wide variety of dining options plus groceries. Had some escargot with my sister at one of the restaurants here. We were there just before the market closed for the day (it was around 2pm I believe) so some of the restaurants or vendors weren\u2019t open when we",
          "Went to market two days before Christmas. As expected, crowd was enormous and the market was very busy. Nonetheless, it was a highly unique experience and a fantastic introduction to French cuisine and food. Produce is expensive, most locals shop at smaller markets along river",
          "Nice market with a lot of restaurants on the go Original and specialties Located near gare de lyon part dieu",
          "Obviously Paul Bocouse is not here but his figure lives on in this rich, heavy and deliciously well crafted cuisine! I love it and always make the call in to Erin on reception for my dinner, super superb the service is, a truly solid place to go with my money!",
          "We visited here with a local guide through Lyon City Greeters (free service) who was passionate about food (goes hand in hand!), which made it a far more interesting visit than had we come on our own. Everything is super expensive, so unless you have a specific reason to go to a",
          "As we arrived around 14:00, the place was full of people and most restaurant s were packed. Most places are a little expensive comparing to similar places in the city. I would consider redecorating the area that it would feel more welcoming. Today it felt a bit like a big hall",
          "After rave reviews of this place we were terribly disappointed.Yes,the stalls are nice and neat,but it lacks atmosphere or soul.Nowhere near as good as markets in other cities.Its sterile and uninteresting.Give it a miss and go to the outdoor market between Pont Wilson and Pont",
          "I hope it is the right place. In Lyon in front of IBIS hotel all several markets for seafood and cheese. We went to resturant called Maison... traditional seafood... all types. Very good. Only the king crab was not that much.",
          "Don't show up too early like we did or there will be few places to eat - I was craving breakfast but few places were open. This is ideal for lunch or a snack. It was still interesting watching impeccably clean stalls setting up various creations. If you're not inspired to eat",
          "The colours, smells and flavours are not to be missed! A highlight of Lyon and its gastronomy. Try the seafood that you choose yourself. Enjoy a glass of wine and some traditional 'plates', and take in the ambiance. Take home some traditional handmade pasta. It is all here.",
          "Just wow, come with an empty stomach, or a large cart to buy anything food related. Options cover everything that you might consider to out into your belly!! Can get very busy and be prepared to wait in line or have something cooked and served!",
          "We only intended to wander around and look at the amazing food on offer, but it all looked so inviting we stayed for a two hour lunch! It's probably top quality food at whichever place you choose but we went to Leon and had six beautiful oysters, half a dozen succulent prawns",
          "Lyon is the gastronomic capital of France. Chef Bocuse has created what Americans would call a Food Court. But on extra steroids. We visited on a Saturday afternoon--not the best choice as it was crowded as could be. But the food in the cases was a sight to behold. Whatever",
          "I love my food so this was the place for me. I spent over 4 hours wandering around this great indoor market ending up having lunch at the seafood place as you come in off Lafayette. Lovely freshly made paella I couldn't fault. Ended my trip to Lyon on a high!!",
          "This was a real let-down. Many stalls were not open and most seemed to be cafes or bars to eat - which would be nice if that's what you were looking for and came at the right time - like lunchtime. We went in the morning about 10 a.m. based on people's reviews saying it was",
          "Indoor open market for live clams, fresh fishes, produce, cured meats and cheese. Some vendors offer tables and food services. Must visit for whoever visiting Lyon France.",
          "If you want to see, taste and eat the BEST of what France has to offer, this is it. Also some Spanish and other high quality products. Fabulous for lunch, especially the seafood bars. Oysters, lobsters and champagne....move on to a cheese monger next, and pop by a bakery for a",
          "Led Halls is a gastronomic eye opener,not only can you buy your produce there you can sit down and enjoy a meal as well with the plethora of restaurants serving wonderful food,even if you visit just to look at what's available you won't be disappointed .",
          "This went easily in my top experiences in Lyon. This market is just perfect. You can find there everything from cakes to raw fish, the atmosphere is wonderful!",
          "We had lunch at Bellota Bellota. Excellent Spanish food. Authentic. Great wine list and the staff was wonderful. Great experience.",
          "An amazing and glorious array of pretty much everything you would ever want to eat and drink; cheese, charcuterie, meat, fish, fruit, vegetables and wine. We stayed on for a delicious lunch at one of the cafes and went home with bags full of goodies that lasted for our entire",
          "Even late after a long day of work, 9pm, we found an open seafood restaurant in the Halles. Oysters were so great, some with only some pepper, a recommendation from the waiter. Wine was excellent as well!",
          "In Part-Dieu, small stalls/shops with great quality produce. This is where to go for special treats - meats, cheeses, fancy cakes and tarts. Beautiful food at a higher price. Well worth a look for foodies.",
          "We went twice. For food and shopping. Tried many things from different shops inside and had a great time. A good taste of good French cooking.",
          "these halles are excellent. All kinds of fresh and made up food. Restaurants to sample delicious things - what more could you want!",
          "So many food stalls for shopping and good quality dining. Worth the hike(its an easy 15 minunre walk from city center",
          "Les Halles was so much fun! We bought a few gifts, sampled dishes and talked to the vendors who were always willing to discuss their products. Best of all was our lunch. Beautiful, generous and the cheese at the end was among the most extensive samples we had anywhere. We loved",
          "This is a very impressive open air market. We walked thru twice and took numerous pictures. The meat, fish,cheese,and produce choices look fresh and excellent quality. I only wish we had a place to cook !!!!",
          "It is a must visit!!! Total upmarket experience! Only quality! If you stay in self catering and want to buy and cook any imaginable quality food product this is a sure visit",
          "Amazing food stalls - probably not what I was expecting though. The cheese, charcuterie and seafood are amazing to look at but not that accessible for travellers unless you\u2019re staying in Lyon for a while and want to grab some next level gastro delights. We went in the morning,",
          "Almost too much to take in and some of the shops seem repetitive but it was loads of fun to walk around and pick up some goodies to ship home. We made sure to eat at one of the restaurants there before so we wouldnt over do.",
          "This a must visit for a foodie when visiting Lyon. You can buy and take home and you can eat there as well. I was heard saying \"it is quite a food emporium.\" The place is akin a temple of food. Not surprising it is a Paul Bocuse namesake. Merchants organize their goods and",
          "After an early breakfast at the hotel, we went to Halles Paul Bocuse. Having just been to his restaurant the night before, we could readily see how this famous chef had exerted his influences in the gastronomic development of the city. A bit of history. In 1859 Lyon created",
          "High end under cover food hall offering compassionate top class service & displays of food making it all so inviting. Just the right size & number of exhibitors to keep your interest fresh & intriguing. Great way to be adventurous & try local produce, you can eat in or takeaway",
          "Upsclae food market with beautiful presentations of food. It has everything edible. Very esthetic but a bit expensive. We went a round lunch time and bought a baguette and some cheeses and speciality meats and organized a nice picnic from it. For deserts the place has numerous",
          "Nice Halles with a lot of restaurants. Seems clean and with toilets. Not like an outdoor market, a bit more fancy but didn't seem morse ecpensive. Had lunch and brought sausage back home.",
          "Loads of very interesting stalls, plenty to see and try. Also had a meal at Paul Bocuse restaurant in the market, stunning seafood, and great service, an iconic place to eat.",
          "I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting here, but it was quite a bit smaller than I anticipated. We went alone, and I wish we would have done a guided tour - it was hard to know the protocols and etiquette so we ended up not eating there. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of rich history, if you",
          "Heard so much about Les Halles and our visit lived upto the hype! The cheese and meat stalls stood out the most.",
          "We made a reservation & ate there for an lunch on a guide book recommendation. No need for a reservation because there are so many restaurants. The food at the AOC was not that special. However the markets make the trip with it. Impressive variety & selection of high quality",
          "What more can I say... if you\u2019re in Lyon and don\u2019t go here you are short changing yourself. Make sure you visit Chez Antonin for the freshest seafood you could possibly imagine. Oysters freshly shucked and other seafood cooked to order - delicious!",
          "Loved it. Thanks God I don't live or work beside the Halles or I would gain a lot of weight very quickly. We tried some cheese I never heard about , tasted some delicious charcuterie, postries etc. only negative point : In some shops, the price are just ridiculously expensive.",
          "Very nice place!! Fine foods and reataurants. Somewhat on a pricey side. We had bery good oysters, escargots and canelles",
          "This fascinating marketplace has some of the best, high end food to buy in Lyon! High end market stalls that have meat, seafood, cheese, bread, pastries, chocolate, sweets, and wine! Our tour guide told us this is where she comes to get food for special occasions. Our tour",
          "This is a must in Lyon, products quality are amazing.. atmosphere is also great especially during Christmas and don\u2019t miss the oysters.. chez Merle or Rousseau.",
          "This is an amazing. Not located in the city center. A large place opened bu the chef paul bocus. Many places to buy great cheese, chocolate, cakes and sausages. There are also some amazing restaurants. Great place for gourmet lovers.",
          "A really nice place to visit, expensive products but amazing quality, you can even eat there if you want.",
          "We didn\u2019t a foodie tour with a guide around this covered market which is named in honour of Chef Paul Bocuse who used to buy his supplies from here. We tried the mini quenelles which looked like bread but was stuffed with pike fish accompanied with a vegetable from the artichoke",
          "A great place to wonder around either for the delicatessen or for a hearty lunch or tasty snack,very atmospheric",
          "Looking for best foodstuffs? Just pop in. Walk around patisserie, fish and cheese, wine and sea food. A particular indoor market. Want to cook or just have a break around a glass of wine sharing cheese or sea food, foie gras or charcuterie on the comptoir or a table just look",
          "You can't come to Lyon and not try this place as there is a great selection of food to buy and try at the same time",
          "We were in the area so dropped in on a Monday, virtually nothing was open. Apparently only the bare minimum is open on a Monday. Nevertheless, it was still interesting seeing the different types of seafood and snails, as well as the endless amount of cheese and smallgoods",
          "This has been on my bucket list for years after Rick Stein went here. It didn\u2019t disappoint but I wish I didn\u2019t have so much wine the night before so I could enjoy this place and eat and drink more! Very iconic, lots of cool places to try and sample. It\u2019s fairly cool inside and",
          "Wonderful! A must for lovers of fine food, fresh ingredients and very delicious the choices are endless! With very helpful and friendly service.",
          "Wonderful place great market but many shops were closed but we were able to stop for some charcuterie and wine",
          "Very disappointed. This was supposed to be the highlight to the end of our trip to Lyon. We arrived after 5pm to get some things for gifts and to eat on the train back to Paris. Mostly everything was closed, only a few places remained open, and they were closing. Very",
          "It's better to visit earlier in the day, as more of the stalls are open. I suspect the time of year influences this too. There are some nice charcuterie, patisserie and seafood stalls, and a few bars to have a drink and eat. But it is a mixed bag overall. Worth a visit if you",
          "There are some really nice options here and some not so good ones. If you want seafood it\u2019s a good stop. Unfortunately the place I wanted to go had stopped serving to check your times as it\u2019s not non-stop service at all locations.",
          "I've traveled the world to visit famous food halls and this one was a surprising letdown. It's an okay market, but not one I would consider one of the world's best. You'd think in a culinary capital like Lyon that a food hall bearing famed chef Paul Bocuse's name would knock it",
          "We arrived at about 11:30 on a Wednesday to a very quiet indoor market. Many booths and restaurants were closing by 1:30 or 2:30 so I am not sure how they sell anything! We did not have a kitchen in Lyon so only bought pralines and some cold salads to have as appetizers in our",
          "We walked a long way expecting this to be something special. We were disappointed. Unlike other classic market halls in Europe this one is in a modern, commercial building. Sure there are plenty of great food stalls, but if you arrive in the early afternoon it can be a ghost",
          "Came with expectations of wow but at 2.30 on Saturday the marketplace is almost like a ghost town so it was quite disappointing though still able to shop for some cheeses and cured meats. Though, services are rather snobbish reminding us of Paris and not very friendly to",
          "The food hall is quite crowded so give yourself time to be able to see it all. Even when it seems that places start to look the same, you can find something unique in each one.",
          "It was an enjoyable feast of eyes and nose...the wine and cheese shops...there were many food stalls...we ended up at an Italian food stall for a great lunch...",
          "This place deserves an applauds. We enjoyed a stroll around lots of super cute coffees and food establishments presented there and had a delisious meal as well . It was really delightful afternoon. Spoil yourself silly and go there for fun and food . You would love it.",
          "This is a high end market with superb produce. We went on Sunday and some shops were packing goods away at 12:00. Be aware of this!",
          "It blew my mind, the presentation, the colours, the smells and the variety of foods available in the covered market Les Halles de Lyon Paul Bocuse. There we found over 60 shops and artisan food makers offering their own uniques tastes of Lyon: cheese, fresh and cured meats,",
          "From a humble peasant meat to the spread of an epic banquet all tastes and pockets are catered for here , a feast for the eyes , nose and of course mouth.",
          "There is simply a stunning variety of foodstuffs to choose from here, all top end. The most unusual thing, I tried a surprisingly delicious and unusual savory macaroon -- Iberian ham flavored. This is a great place to grab a few different delicacies and take them out for a",
          "We were hoping for a quick lunch around 2:30pm but saw to our amazement that most stores were closed. The market advertises that it\u2019s open till 10:30pm but in reality the market is dead in the afternoon. Plan accordingly. This is not like the markets in Spain which are really",
          "Expecting to see one of those classic European covered food markets we were slightly disappointed to arrive at Les Halles de Lyon Paul Bocuse to find almost no fresh food, there's one fruit and vegetable store and a few cheese shops along with a butcher but it's mostly high end",
          "This was the high light of our trip! We walked to the market to meet our chef for our cooking lesson. When we first entered the market my wife and I were on sensory overload. The place is absolutely amazing. Our chef instructed us on picking out the fresh veggies to what to",
          "Taken from the name of the famous and renowned chef, this is a must go for all foodies out there. This visit will activate all your senses, and will make you beg for a bit more stomach space to try just one more bite of something else. Had the oysters at one of the many places,",
          "very interesting market with lots of meat fish and cheese delicious pastry. They have little areas to eat inside and outside close to the main train stations easy walking access to other restaurants.",
          "This is one of the most elegant hall or covered market that I have ever visited. The presentation of products if exquisite. The small restaurants offer shell fish as well as other items of the best quality .Definitely worth a visit!",
          "This market is amazing, all of the produce is beautifully presented and top notch. If I lived in Lyon I would shop here every day. The restaurants interspersed throughout the market all look inviting, it is hard to choose. We selected Resto Halle and loved it so much we",
          "Many restaurants,many options, nice and friendly people! Everything here is fresh! Although there was a \u201cdogs are not allowed \u201c sign, the security guard let us in and told us there was no problem. Some of the restaurants though were closed.",
          "Our venture out of the main tourist area in Lyon, to the indoor Halles revived by the late, great Chef Paul Bocuse, was a disappointment. A 20 minute walk east from the Presqu\u2019ile over the Pont Lafayette and along Cours Lafayette, we found a modern glassed 2 - storey building",
          "Lea Halles de Paul Bocuse is deservedly named after the great man. It is probably the most beautiful food hall I have ever been. The most fantastic produce. Definitely a most for a visit to Lyon!",
          "We visited mid-day in the middle of the week and it was not nearly as busy as I thought it might be. There are a plethora of vendors selling all manner of products Lyonnais: fresh local produce, pate, cheeses, baked goods, sausages and meat, fish and shellfish, chocolates, etc.",
          "Great place to spend some time enjoying the sites, flavoured and smells of the local food! Some nice \u2018tapas style\u2019 places to eat.",
          "Hungry? Who cares! Go anyway, you\u2019ll be hungry by the time your nose catches up with your eyes! From wines and cheeses to cassoulet to lentils du puy, there\u2019s something for every taste and every budget!",
          "Being short of time just spent an hour salivating over the goods on offer. Bought a few bits to take home but will return when next in town to eat at one of the many outlets.",
          "This is the most amazing indoor market I have ever been to, it doesn\u2019t even feel like your typical street markets, very clean and well presented. Each stall takes so much pride in presentation of individual products and if your feeling a little on the hungry side, have no fear",
          "We visited the Paul Bocuse Food Markets but surprised to see only quite a few of the vendors were not open on a Tuesday. Most were open and there were a selection of specialists with cheese, meats, seafood, butchery, bread, cakes and chocolateries. There were a number of bars",
          "A mecca for food lovers. A myriad bounty of delectable consumables. There any number of small restaurants to choose from within the complex. They have guided tours for those interested but you can easily ramble and delight your senses.",
          "We always like to visit local markets when overseas and Les Halles Paul Bocuse is a must do activity. Firstly it is easy to find and unless you are in walking distance there is a nearby Metro station, but we found using a taxi a better way to go as one can see a few more",
          "this is the best place t eat frog legs in Lyon - get there early, but also oyster and wine at any time of the day, and any other food - more expensive than other places but best quality",
          "It\u2019s a covered high quality food market and eat in shops. Sweet or savoury you can find everything u need to cook at home or eat there",
          "My wife and I visited on a Tuesday, mid-afternoon. Most of the eating places and about half of the shops were closed. We returned in the evening, hoping that the eating establishments would be open, but they were not, and by now most of the shops were also closed. The whole",
          "This Les Halles is in a league of its own. It\u2019s a food museum in which all the food is for sale. The assortment of cheeses and cured meats is truly amazing and beautifully arranged. There are many restaurants, so make sure you are hungry when you go.",
          "A must visit if in Lyon, not the cheapest produce but the highest quality I have seen anywhere. It's difficult to know where to start but the macarons just inside the main entrance are to die for, particularly the savory ones. You could do much worse than stop at the stall",
          "One of the best covered markets in France. This is not one of those covered markets that could be grouped under the banner of a normal French market as the produce is upmarket and the range somewhat limited. The quality of the produce is superb, especially if you are a lover",
          "Building and surrounding nothing special, but there are many shops with delicious food, really a gourmet heaven! There are also some good restaurants with good food, e.g. I had some oysters which were excellent. I think it is worth a visit once in Lyon if you are a food lover!",
          "I know people will argue that is commercialized and expensive trap but for us it was like a Disney land of food with an abundance of places to taste smell and view sea food meat vegetables cheese breads and sweets. It\u2019s a pity they close so early at noon...",
          "Just absolutely fabulous place for anyone who loves really good food. There are everything you can imagine and much more.",
          "I visited this market with my grandma on a very rainy day and OMG how delightfull. It's might be not in everyones wallet, but it is very very good quality price for a GOURMET experience. We had oysters at \"Maisson Rousseau\" and it was delicious. Definetly a plece to stop by and",
          "This is a great place for anyone that enjoys food and drink. Plenty of places to eat and pick up some amazing food. Highly recommend it",

          "This market place, where merchants sell variety of high-quality fresh food, is very impressive. Many people spend time there, sitting around stands or tables and eating seafood or meat products or all sorts of sweets. There is reasonably-priced large car garage attached to it.",
          "On a recent trip to Lyon we visited this collection of food shops and restaurants. Absolutely unbelievable assortment of food including fresh fish, meats of every type, pate, sausages, piles of (unknown) cheeses and prepared deserts. All of it was impeccable. Lunch at a little",

          "This was quite a long walk from our hotel but it was a bright morning. Les Halles were full of top quality food stalls and prices to match. Very interesting to look around. Masses of places to eat but we were a bit early. Would go back with a list and plenty of cash!!!",

          "This wonderful marketplace for the best produce is off the beaten track but well worth a visit. Two superb meals in two of the restaurants.",
          "A lovely afternoon spent wandering around the food hall. Would have loved to have bought more and tried lots but only a short visit to Lyon.",
          "We came through here on a rainy Wednesday afternoon and instead of checking first, we arrived to find many traders had already closed for the day. What was still open was really good but the atmosphere without all the stores open and the subsequent visitors was subdued. So get",
          "A HUGE array of food options await you. If you can eat it, someone is selling it here. Plenty of places with tables to \"eat in.\" Or, grab food for a picnic. It is close to the Part Dieu station, so if you are traveling from Lyon bt=y train, this is a perfect place to get food",
          "This place is foodie heaven. Stall after stall of food, wonderful selection of cheese, charcuterie, meat, seafood and patisserie. We wished we were staying in Lyon with a kitchen so that we could take advantage of the delicacies on offer.",

          "This food hall is definitely more like a collection of upscale restaurants and gourmet grocery stores than typical food halls that resemble indoor farmers markets. It is hard to decide what to buy but you can\u2019t make a bad choice!",
          "This is foodie heaven, Lyon style. Everything you could think of eating, with some emphasis on seafood / oysters. Really crowded when we went on the weekend, but not hard to find a place to eat.",
          "Formidable, confortable, beau . Nathalie\u2019s apartement est parfait .pour tous The apt is close to everything. We enjoyed the market with stunning variety of food, visited parks, museums and cathedrals. Washing, cooking and washing up is a real pleasure on the premises. I",
          "If you want to look at and smell food then this is the place. Everything under one roof . But it extremely busy. Restaurants can be a bit pricey and very busy, but to experience food on a grand scale you must visit.",
          "When I visited the market there were so many people there that it was really hard to walk and move around. The place itself is not anything special - a lot of meat and cheese and some pastries. I've seen a lot of better markets.",
          "Incredibly busy so you just don\u2019t get a chance to see anything only two of the restaurants looked interesting but they were very full and had a waiting list Smaller markets in regional towns are much more fun",
          "Amazing variety of foods - our single visit was not enough. Cafes were bustling with couples and families enjoying their meals, especially seafood. Variety of cheeses was astounding, which could be said for a multitude of other products. Go hungry, stay for a while.",
          "This has everything you could want. I stayed at a hotel just across the street and came here everyday (sometimes multiple times a day) to get cheese, bakery items, fruit, sweets, etc. I usually came in the morning and grabbed something for breakfast. I never found it",

          "This is not your traditional European market, but rather a jazzy, modern upscale building with quality food. The ambience is very refreshing and trendy. The prices are outrageous so buy if you must, but know that you are paying to be there, not because you are getting any value",

          "Quality produce and regional specialities plus great seafood. This is where locals go to stock up. Best to go in the mornings.",
          "This place is considered an attraction but I cannot recommend it for tourists. It is similar to a farmers' market with lots of people selling prepared food, vegetables, fruits, meat and cheese. Unless you are renting an apartment, I would give it a miss.",
          "There\u2019s arrays and arrays of food and restaurants. As the French take their food very seriously, everything is beautifully laid out and tempting. You can easily spend a good part of the day here, especially if you go and get a meal!",

          "A modern and mostly gourmand version of London's Burlington Arcade. Good for foodies but not for the rest of us.",
          "Since Lyon is so connected to Paul Bocuse, we had to check this out.We liked it because even though is is very comprehensive, it wasn't overwhelming in terms of its size.As expected all kinds of food ( and wine) was there, and we bought a few things to try back in our room. If",
          "You could spend serious money here! A fabulous market filled with meats and cheeses, cakes and delis. Most stalls have a small cafe/restaurant attached. This is clearly where the locals head for both shopping and lunch. Head here for lunch and to buy lots of treats. I am not one",
          "What an amazing selection of all different foods, presented in almost artistic displays. The cheeses, meats, poultry, sweets and wines were all tempting. We had a food tasting session put on by Sibilia of meats and cheeses with Beaujolais wines. All tasted great.",
          "Most beautiful selection of every sort of prepared food. Like nothing else. All looks so stunning. And what we have had measures up in taste. Great for an at home or apartment meal. And not too expensive for restaurant quality plus. Can also eat at little restaurants throughout.",
          "We spent a whole morning here walking around the different food outlets just ogling the delicious treats on offer. Our personal favourites were oysters with champagne and duck and foie gras p\u00e2t\u00e9 en croute. This is a real experience and really central.",
          "If you want the full French experience, this is the place to visit. Magnificent produce, superb cheeses, cold cuts, delicatessen and fish, excellent little restaurants (for a price, though) and even chocolate and wines ! The best covered market you will find in town. I love it",
          "This is the most amazing of all the Les Halles. Way better than Paris. The quality of the pastries, cheeses, and produce is off the chart, and the vendors were especially friendly and giving of their time. We never encountered a vendor who didn't know some English.",
          "If you like to eat, drink or smell wonderful scents this is your place. If you want to pontificate, split hairs and show the world what an opinionated gourmand you are then feel free to complain about the lack of Asian, North American, South American and African delicacies.",
          "Wow, wow and wow!!! This is the most amazing Market I have ever been to. So authentic, classy and amazing variety of delicious, quaint bars and cafes and treats. It is so extensive and yet retains its Lyonaise charm! Even though Lyon is fairly small and a great walking city,",
          "Don't miss a visit here, it's an eye opener, so glad I brought a cool bag with me, came home with cheeses and meats and glace fruits to die for. The stalls were so clean and the produce was first class, every stall we stopped at had a bonjour.",
          "This is an ideal restaurant, central, not far from the Parc de la Tete d'Or in the building that formerly housed the Gare de l'Est. The idiosyncratic freight train that noisily circulates above the heads of the customers is a quirk that I can easily forgive. The food is, as",

          "We loved wandering through this market - the stalls were overflowing with goods of all descriptions, beautifully presented, plenty of tastings on offer. With a nice cafe bar in the middle, a good lace to spend an hour or so if you get the chance. Many products are packaged",
          "we always seek out les Halles wherever we are in France. This one was very clean and airy but rather more upmarket in its goods and prices. Worth a visit but don't expect any bargains",
          "My wife and I took another guided walking tour, this time of the cooking traditions and practices centering on the area around Lyon and the historical culinary traditions Lyonnais. Since 1935, Lyon has been called \"world capital of gastronomy.\" We toured the Les Halles de Lyon",
          "I strolled over there early yesterday morning. Not all the stalls were open but most of them were, and the displays were marvelous. I bought some croissants, butter, and cheese, but if you want seafood, or pastry, or chocolate or meat you can find wonderful quality.",

          "I wish we had known that this market is so quiet during August. Many stalls were closed. I look forward to visiting some other time.",
          "Les Halles Bocuse are the perfect place to enjoy either a walk and discover the typical Lyonnaise Cuisine or take a break and taste some Quenelles, oysters or Saucisson Brioch\u00e9. You will find the best shops such as Mons (for cheese), Bobosse (for saucisson brioch\u00e9). I also",

          "This is the second time in four years that I've visited Les Halles - Lyon. Again I was not disappointed, the produce on show and for sale is amongst the best, if not the best in the world. Works of art are displayed for you to consume - from the best Jamon from Spain to the most",
          "Nice and colorful food market gives a lot of variety of foods to buy or to eat in. You can choose from everything - french and world cuisine, drinks and eat-in restaurants. Really nice to just go there and buy different small bites and eat them outside of the place.",

          "Whether you want to get provisions for your own cooking or hotel picnic or you want to graze all the choices right there, Les Halles is a must see in Lyon. Think about it as Boston's Faneuil Hall, only larger. We spent 3 hours there, many little eatery options there in addition",
          "This place is kind of out of the way from the city centre. There are different kinds of seafood, meats and vegetable and as well cooked foods and lots of desserts. While you are there, don't forget to check out the large mural of chef Paul Bocuse on one of the building wall",

          "Wonderful hall full of ingredients if you are lucky enough to have kitchen nearby or an empty refrigerated suitcase to take it all home. You can also have lunch in the market - its always good, every time and this time a simple St Marcellin croustade with salad was rated by us",
          "I visited around Easter time, when some of the stores were closed. Still got a good idea how much different sorts of options there are on a regular day. I can image the place being full of people on regular days. All items sold looked really good quality, and the restaurants",

          "The only time we could fit a trip in was on Easter Sunday morning, but it was advertised as open, so we strolled along at about 0800. Sadly quite a few of the stalls were closed. I'd hoped we could get a croissant and coffee there for breakfast, but sadly there was little",
          "We only had 30 minutes or so to wander around and didn't investigate the pricing too much. However, the range of amazing produce available was mind-blowing. Many of the stalls also had mini-restaurants attached to them were you could try some of the produce in a simply prepared",

          "Well you will not be surprised for me to say Lyon is the gastronomic capital in France and therefor hands down in the world. I am from Lyon. This place was created 20 years ago about. It replaces the Halle's that use to be place ses Cordeliers in a more modern setting. The",
          "After reading about Matt Feroze's experiences working at this market in his book The Cheese and I, this is a place we had to visit on our trip to Lyon. It is a food-lovers paradise and you could quite happily wander around here all morning taking in the sights, smells and",
          "This market is not in one of the most interesting boroughs but after you are inside get immersed into the food stalls. you can have a meal in one of the small restaurants inside. It's a place to go around to discover all that wonderful food. Cheeses and desserts are amazing.",
          "A paradise. We did shopping for cheese and meat and closed the morning with a french brunch: Oyster & Champagne. Comes at a price but still better then elsewhere. Try to be there at 09:30 latest. It gets very crowded.",
          "The surrounding streets are undergoing renovation thus making it difficult to find the bus stop. Outside looks like a 1970's concrete block. However, once inside this purpose built building, it is a remarkable feast of delicacies, restaurants, bars and just simple food stalls.",
          "Vast array of food, wine and restaurants in this undercover market. Went there at 10am on a Saturday morning and amazed by the number of people eating oysters for breakfast. Easy to see why Lyon is rated as the gastronomic capital of France with markets like this.",
          "There were more restaurants than I expected. Some of the stalls were vacant. After visiting Les Halles in Avignon I was expecting more. Never sampled or bought anything which is highly unusual for me in these types of markets. Best explored when you are not hunger because",
          "Wow , we have been in some food court before but this one is the best. Authentique, many choices very elegant .",
          "This was my 1st visit to Lyon. I stayed in an AirB&B right next door to Les Halles, which was within walking distance to everything, i.e. Train and bus station, centre of town both new and old. On Cours Lafayette. Day 1. Walking tour, with map in hand, of Les Halles to get",
          "What a great place to walk around for foodies! All fresh produce and at an impressive level of variety! I could spend a whole day just walking around, tasting and talking to the different artisans. Rhone Alpes' greatest all in one place!",
          "What an amazing display of produce. It is overwhelming the extent of what is on display. Three of us spent two hours wandering, looking closely, asking questions and generally becoming excited about lunch. We firstly enjoyed a glass of champagne before heading to quenelle",
          "We visited at 8pm. The closing times are shown online as 10.30, yet when we arrived, most of the shops were closed. There were possibly 5 sea food restaurants still open (and the smell of fish was very strong). We left with empty hands and hungry bellies.",
          "Really nice place to enjoy a good meal with friends and taste several flavours. Recommended for people who they don't know French and Mediterranean food.",
          "A food hall and restaurants all in one. The space is lively and modern. The selection superb. The prices are higher than the wonderful street markets but it is still a must see. My complaint, I was without a kitchen. Oh, the meals I could prepare.",
          "Cheese, chocolate, yogurt, saucisson... great food there even for tourists. I stopped by to have a look but finally went out with many small piece of cheeses with yaourt in my bag. A girl who sold milk product from her family's farm also gave me tiny pots of creme for free. I",
          "Enjoyed the food hall enormously. Definitely worth a stop. Have lunch here if you can. However, the building is modern and charmless.",
          "Everything that is good about fine food, delivery, service, display, all top quality, a real pleasure to visit. Whether it's to have a snack, breakfast, lunch, ap\u00e9ritif, dinner the ambiance is a pleasure to feel. Open all day and evening the displays of rich French food are",
          "And it's Bocuse. And Lyon. Definitely go if you are making dinner. Or if you want to see a lot of pretty food all in one place. It's an upscale food hall; like the other upscale food halls around. If you've been to one, you don't necessarily have to go to another, unless you",
          "All the food here is absolutely fantastic. There is so much choice and everything is of the highest quality. Make sure you come on an empty stomach. We enjoyed our first experience of frogs legs...",
          "There are 40 markets in Lyon but this is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, highlighting local specialities from charcuterie, p\u00e2t\u00e9s and reputed Poulet Bresse chickens, to rows and rows of cheese; freshwater fish and quenelles; to chocolate, bonbons and patisseries. Stalls are more",
          "This is an indoor marketplace with vendors selling charcuterie, cheese, meats, seafood, desserts and the like. The place is the cleanest marketplace I have ever visited and the food offered is over the top. The oysters were so fresh, they were delicious. I could go on about",
          "If you are only half a foody, go here. See and smell meats, vegetables, cheeses, cakes, breads, deserts. And cafes. This is no cheap market, but a smart place with highest quality foods. Enjoy!",

          "Having seen it Anthony bourdain I had great expectations for this place , but a tourist needs a guide or Antony bourdain himself to enjoy this place. Otherwise it is just another closed food market. Find someone who knows , ask or research before you go otherwise the shops are",
          "Les Halles are a paradise for food lovers. This is where you can buy the best Lyon foods to bring home. There are also several places to eat at a comptoir for a quick bite of proper food. A must to stop by when in Lyon.",
          "If interested in food this is the place to go. As Lyon is the food capital city it is where you can see the local food.",
          "I tasted one of the finest cheeses, chocolates and cakes at this market. A must visit for foodies in Lyon.",
          "It is a must for every foodie! You can get very hungry just by walking around and see those gourmet foods. They are very helpful and everyone can advise you tips for your cooking at home. It's a very fancy market and a little too pricy, but you will definately find something to",
          "One of the best market of the world. If you have a restaurant or you are housewife or only visitor, you can find everything what you want. Delicious breakfast or dinner, wonderful material for the cooking, or amazing gift for your friends.",
          "Everything you could imagine you can find in this market! It would be better though to be in a bigger place. The prices are ok if you consider it s more gourmet food I bought wine from Nicolas but unfortunately the didn't understand English. Praline are sooo yummi! A small",

          "Enjoyed a wander around and managed to have oysters and wine for breakfast followed by a great espresso. So may stalls to tempt you - we were tempted and bought lots to enjoy at a picnic. It's a lovely way to see people shop - made me envious that I have to go to a supermarket",
          "Came here twice on our quick visit to Lyon because it's totally worth it. We came in late morning one day, sat down and had some oysters with white wine (macon), and then started walking around, tasting and buying different food. We came back another day just to pick up a bunch",
          "The place to be if you are interested in delicacies! Cheese, charcuterie, fish and shellfish, meat, foie gras, black truffle from the region, fresh bread and pastries, pralines...Whatever your heart and palate desire :) Possibility to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner on the spot",
          "This place is more of a selection of fine food shops rather than a market. Went there on a full stomach so wasn't really in the mood. In hindsight, there is a lot of things I would have like to have bought.",
          "The market is so incredible I might go back again while I am here in Lyon! It is amazing to just admire the beautiful displays of food. There are also many bakery stands and sweets to buy, so a great place to get gifts. Also, many restaurants there seem to be a great place to",
          "Absolutely lovely place to visit for anyone who is the least gourmand and appreciates the sight of incredible food!",
          "We went to Les Halles de Lyon after a lazy morning of sleeping late in our Apart hotel. The sights and smells of this place is sure to delight any foodie or non-foodie. The plan was tour the whole place before settling at some place to eat, but we couldn't contain ourselves",
          "A wonderful celebration of everything food! Bustling lunch venue, get in early for a table and make sure you don't want to eat after 2pm as most eating places are closed but the food stalls are still open.",
          "we regretted that we had no kitchen to cook as the food looked so tempting ! The market is every day open and is very busy especially around lunchtime. Hard to get a place. But worth a visit and bring some time.",

          "We went there on our last day in Lyon. A busy satirday morning and we loved it. Everybody slurping on oysters, drinking aperitifs. Its perfect to take goodies home if you visit Lyon by car",
          "This is a must see in Lyon! I visited the place one day and then returned the next day. It's really amazing, the highest quality of food one can imagine. So much meat and cheese and seafood and sugared-fruits and caviar and truffels. Amazing, amazing, amazing!!!",

          "Very interesting attraction comprised of many overpriced and pretentious food items. Convenient to the bus, his is a great way to kill an hour. Very little is affordable and we were stunned by the amount of people there on a Tuesday. The Bocuse name is he pull. Buy the macarons,",
          "It's a gourmet food hall of quality with some nice little restaurants. A cross between an up market food hall and market. Nothing here you can't get elsewhere for much less but it's all in one place and Paul Bocuse puts his name to it! For the tourists it's ok.",
          "Had the opportunity to be in Les Halles de Lyon Paul Bocuse yesterday and I was amazed by the variety of choices for French cuisine. You get the chance to see and taste the different cuisine that you crave for. This place will awaken your sense for smell and taste. You can",
          "If you enjoy good food and a buzzing atmosphere, visit this food hall which is a treat for the senses. We visited on a rainy day in November and once inside we were transported to another world. The food stalls and restaurants offer the highest quality produce and the",

          "Les Halles Paul Bocuse was just across the road from our hotel and required a daily visit. Meat, fish, vegetables, cheese, beers and wine if the highest quality were all on sale. It certainly made you wish that you were self-catering!! To refer to Les Halles as a market would",
          "Good place for Lyonnaise foods, many up market shops selling authentic Lyonnaise's cuisines and raw cooking materials.",
          "What a wonderful food market! We were with a group and had a chance to sample sweets from Lyon, local prosciutto, sausage, oysters, wine and more. (I believe samples are available to individuals as well). There are places to eat in the market also (good for lunch).",
          "I really like European markets - those in the small villages as well as large city markets like the one in Lyon. Lyon is considered the gastronomical epicenter of France and its market reflects that excellence. You can shop for your home cooking needs or have lunch there to",
          "Living in Geneva, this place is soooooooo much cheaper than most markets around Geneva, like the one in Ferney! Good selection of Cheese, butcher, wines, and a nice place to enjoy oysters after all the shopping. Plan to go there once every two months for food shopping. Also,",
          "You will want to have a kitchen to be able to cook all the good things you will see in this place. Good that they have restaurants so that you can taste and not only see the wonderful food and ingredients presented in this place.",
          "This is a truly pristine high-end food market with some great restaurants. We purchase some of the best breads we had on the whole trip.",
          "Fabulous place to browse and stop for a drink or 2. Disappointment was that we couldn't eat past 6.30pm. Probably best to go at lunchtime",
          "A museum for food that you can sample!!! Excellent products of meat, fish, cheese, charcuterie, bread, pastries, chocolate, fruit and vegetables. Mixed in a bar stops to enjoy food and drink. A few sit down restaurants are mixed in the shops. Well worth a visit.",
          "We visited this market hoping for something a bit special, but left a bit disappointed. Paul Bocuse seems to be synonymous with Lyon and his name is associated with lots of food related venues and institutions. The market is a series of stalls and the produce no doubt is",
          "Lots of shops selling only the finest produce of the region. We had a incredible seafood extravaganza , oysters from Normandy, prawns from Madagascar seriously good food. Great salmon salad and fab service . Parking station is easily accessible . A must see!",
          "We thought we'd see something of Paul Bocuse but turned out to be a collection establishments serving different foods under one roof. Its only a 15 minute walk from the main train station going through a large mall so its easy to visit. Helps a lot when its raining. First",
          "Covered market situated near city centre full of vegetables, fruits, sausages of all kind especially those from Lyon, large varieties of cheeses, smell of freshly baked breads. Fresh seafood plus restaurant of which we consumed 6 ousins (sea urchin) each and plate of various",
          "A bit disappointing that there are not so many locals buying their food from this market. In fact, we saw more tourists when we came here. Yes, we were also tourists but we don't like going to the market to do some sight seeing but experience what the locals do. Yes there are",
          "It is a very cosy place to visit. You can find traditional french food and patisserie. Early in the morning is the best time to go. There are different kind of little shops where you can shop or eat and drink and enjoy the fresh food.",
          "This was one of our must see sights in Lyon and it didn't disappoint. The food displays inside are amazing and we spent a happy hour or so wandering around in awe. The prices are high so we didn't buy anything but it was well worth the visit. We went mid afternoon and it was",
          "Les Halles market is a lively,busy place where you can find loads of fresh produce from meat ,seafood ,fruit and veggies and sweets! It's very expensive and hard to get to the counter to be served,we found lovely produce in shops everywhere in Lyon,I guess if you are a serious",
          "A busy and vibrant indoor local market all be it very high end. Amazing cheese to buy and most stalls have the facilities for you to eat what you have bought or a chef to cook it for you. Best on week middays when office workers come for lunch. Quiet on Sunday. It is pricey but",

          "French food at it's best. A true art. An all-senses experience: visual, olfactive, and if you are fine with that level of prices, a taste experience you will never forget. Also, it's possible to eat and drink wine at many counters. The one with big tables located at the rue de",
          "A visit to Les Halles is a treat for the eyes even if you do not eat there. I went there around 16:30 on a Tuesday. There were not many people so it was really pleasant to wake around. All the stalls were very clean and laid out in an organised manner. There were all kinds",

          "This is the single best food market I've seen. The precision and quality of the food produce here is mesmeric. There is cake, cheese, meats, seafood of wonderful variety. The building is not particularly impressive but the stalls will blow your mind. Its worth taking a spare",
          "From the outside it is a pretty ugly building, but once inside you are in food heaven, great place to buy food for a picnic then go to one of Lyon's large gardens and sit in the sun and enjoy, you will want to buy from every seller, but if you are short of cash, just go in for a",
          "We had heard so much about these markets but were pretty disappointed. They aren't really like a proper market anymore - more an upmarket collection of cafes, restaurants and a few fancy food stalls.",
          "Great produce for taking away to cook at home. Really odd opening times for the bars and restaurants in the hall so we didn't eat there because nothing was open/signed. Very friendly service at each stall.",
          "This is a market for those with a bit of money! It is beautifully layed out and covered. Their stalls are beautiful. Loads of colour and culinary talent to be seen everywhere...... Fish you've never heard of, langoustines that are enormous, caviar, truffle bars, from ages, deli",
          "quite hard to find from the metro. Nice food stalls but quite expensive - few restaurants where you can have a meal or a drink/coffee which we did. we visited when it was raining so enjoyed it but I think if weather nice then there are alot of other things you can do.",
          "It took us a while to find this place situated on Garabaldi just off the junction of Lafayette, its an easy walk from the centre of Lyon from Cordeliers and across the Rhone. Pretty much whatever food you fancy is on display here and served on the countless restaurants. Every",

          "We were on a Viking cruise and took the opportunity to visit the market with the chef from our ship. What a sight! the most exquisite looking desserts and candied fruit, the rows and rows of different cheeses, the olives, the sausages, the oysters. As he said, \"I could spend",
          "This indoor market has the best for food in the Lyon tradition: sausage, cheese from all over France, wine, fresh fish and meat, oyster bar, foie gras, vegetable stall, you name it! All the produce are premium quality, so prices are a bit high.",
          "But not so many to eat. Unless you have a kitchen. If in a hotel, you are going to see many things, but not be able to sample. For being more touristy, I would have the stores selling amounts or little plates so they can be consumed on site, as places in Berlin -",
          "Went here twice on a single weekend in Lyon. What we enjoyed the most was eating oysters and escargot in different bars (really good quality). We also ate at the truffle place and at AOC and would not recommend either. Every single restaurant has very friendly people. There is",
          "I would definitely recommend a trip here. The food is amazing and there is loads to choose from. The quality is clearly very good too. I could have spent an absolute fortune! If you're heading to a park or out of the city for the day then this is the perfect place to pick up",
          "When in Lyon, make it a point to visit the food market. You can spend as much or as little time as you like. However, if you go on an empty stomach, plan to leave with a lighter wallet! Originally on Presque Ile, the market opened at its current location two years ago. It is",
          "Would certainly recommend all visitors to Lyon go here for a morning or afternoon. The stalls are fantastic and well worth seeing. They look so inviting and make you want to buy! We ate at one of the places selling oysters and it was wonderful.",

          "Stroll around for a few hours and feast on excellent snacks while visiting this upscale market featuring high end quality french products and edibles, it,s not cheap here though",
          "This was the second time that I visited Les Halles and it was just as great as the first time. Don't expect cheap eats, but do expect high-quality and fresh seafood and meats. Lots of stalls also to satisfy your sweet tooth.",

          "I have been here before and I just had to return. It is a feast for the eyes; the produce and restaurants in the market are wonderful. All the stall-holders we talked to were extremely polite, friendly and helpful. Next time, I might just have to hire a refrigerated van.",

          "You can be overwhelmed by the quality and choice in the market hall. The presentation of the food is absolutely stunning. There are multiple restaurants serving degustation menus. From memory one menu that included fresh oysters and langostines was 128\u20ac for two people. We",

          "This is an excellent place to visit. The location is quite hard to find, In a built up area of Lyon not near the main shopping district. However it was worth the trip. The market is full of stalls selling every type of food, cheese, meats, desserts, chocolates etc. Each",
          "Well, whenever you go to a restaurant in lyon you can hardly make a big mistake as 90% are professional, serious and effective. Lyon is well known for the French Gastronomy Capitale so if you wonder where is the epicentre or source of inspiration for fusion, authentic above all",
          "Les Halles, which is about 5 minute's walk from the Part-Dieu shopping center, is a covered market place with different stores selling various of local and regional food. There are butchers, poissoniers, fromagers (cheese stores), wine stores, chocolate stores, etc. etc.",
          "We had expected a bit more so we were a bit disappointed with this modern take on a traditional market hall. However, seen in the context of Lyon where we encountered so many fabulous places, it is only fair to say that had the Les Halles been located in most other cities, it",
          "A great break in the middle of a working day. This place is heaven for gastronomic lovers. From cheese to bakeries, oysters, wine and food. The entrance is free but you eat/drink and such and... A good coffee break + great canel\u00e9",

          "My wife was very much in anticipation of visiting this market. However, upon arrival we were quite surprised at how empty of vendors it was. We weren't the only visitors either as the website stated that the market would definitely be open when we visited in August.",
          "We were so looking forward to visiting and after checking the website for opening hours we decided to make a day for it. Unfortunately it was barely open with only a few stalls operating with hardly a soul there. It was a Monday and the website as well as the sign outside the",

          "What a wonderful place to try all the flavors of Lyon! However, there are no places to sit unless you are buying from the stalls/restaurants that serve food. So plan on buying and bringing home or enjoying the food at the restaurants. We did a little of both.",

          "It looked a short walk from the centre of town. On a hot day, it took 30 long, slow, sweaty minutes. Suss out the nearest metro or bus route before you go! It's foodie heaven! Having got there we were ready for a cooling drink and some sustenance. That's what they do best",
          "Had heard a lot about the place and had high expectations. For sure there was a lot of good quality stands. There was however a lot of lots that we're closed which to me is a sign of little activity. Difficult to taste things.",
          "Yes the produce is amazing. However I'd rather go to a local market. This lacks ambience and is full of tourists and tour groups. The site is not particularly central and requires a long walk for minimal reward. Stall upon stall in a dark, characterless building. If I was",
          "My wife and I visited \"Les Halles\" on a Sunday morning whilst on a short break to Lyon. The display of meat, cheeses, seafood, bread and pastries was truly first class. It was evidently the place to be seen for the locals. There are a number of restaurants and bars all packed.",
          "All the cheeses. And all the meats. And the fish and the shellfish and the offall and the sweets. This is what all food markets want to be when they grow up. It's not cheap but it's worth it.",

          "We spent a few hours wandering around all the stores enjoying the vast area of food and wines on display. We ended up having lunch consisting of cheese, bread, prosciutto and wine...as you do in France. Very nice though strangely they served us Spanish wine? Was not overly busy",
          "Wonderful experience.... a must do in Lyon. We had the most delicious oysters and champagne. The stalls are a feast for the eyes",
          "If you like simple sea food at lunch time then this is the place to go. Have a good look at all of the stalls offering fruit and vegetables, sea food and fish and fine ham and cheeses then choose a venue within the market to sit and enjoy some of the fare over a glass of wine.",

          "I have visited many food markets and I really was disappointed in Lyon's. I mean, it's the food capital of France and that's all they offer? There were no fruit or veggies. The cheese and bread options were poor. The charcuterie was scarce...",
          "It is simply all about food. Great food, expensive food, all sorts of food. No doubt the restaurants are good, presumably expensive. To be honest, though,if you're not interested in ogling food, don't bother. Recommended length of visit below is for non-foodies. No doubt foodies",

          "The amount and varieties of food were staggering. It really is something to see. I tried all kinds of wonderful things. One disappointment was the hours. It said it was open late (10:30 I believe) it really wasn't. I was excited to take my husband, who had been at work all day.",
          "We caught the C3 bus which was only the third stop from Cordeliers Metro Station in the Town centre. In the Hall there was a large range of food stores and restaurants, including pasties, cakes, cheese, confectionary, pate, wine, pasta, seafood and lots of reasonably priced",
          "Great address if you want to stock up with French delicacies or have a quick bite for lunch. Offers a little bit of all food cultures.",
          "Just an incredible range of small food shops, small restaurants. Meat, baking, chocolate, wine, cheese. Not many veggies, but that seems to be the Lyonnaise way. Great fun to explore, and good food options."

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Place des Jacobins is a square located in the 2nd arrondissement of Lyon. It was created in 1556 and a fountain was added in 1856. The square belongs to the zone classified as World Heritage Site by UNESCO. According to Jean Pelletier, this square is one of the most famous in Lyon, because of its location in the center of the 2nd arrondissement and its heavy traffic, as 12 streets lead here. The square, particularly its architecture and its features, has changed its appearance many times throughout years.\n\n\n== Successive names ==\nIn 1740, the square was called Place Confort which then absorbed the rue des Alards in 1556, named after a rich family who owned buildings in the neighborhood. In 1782, it became the Place des Jacobins, then, in 1794, was renamed Place de la Fraternit\u00e9. After changing its name twice \u2014 Place de la Pr\u00e9fecture in 1858, then Place de l'Imp\u00e9ratrice in 1868 \u2014, it was renamed Place des Jacobins in February 1871. The current name of the square comes from the Jacobins, also named religious Preachers of the Order of St. Dominic, who occupied the building on the southern side of the square from 1296. These Dominicans were called Jacobins when Philippe Auguste gave them a building in Paris and the brothers went on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela (Jacobus in Latin).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Square and buildings ===\nThe square was created in 1556 after a request by King Henri II who wanted to replace the monks cemetery, located at the north of the Jacobins church, with a market. One year later, the walls of the old cemetery of monks disappeared and the place became a public square. In 1562, some buildings were destroyed by the troops of the Baron des Adrets to open the rue Saint-Dominique. The square was then triangular and named Place de Confort.From 1296, the Jacobins had a convent on the place, with a garden, and Jacques Du\u00e8ze was elected Pope in this convent on 7 August 1316 by 23 cardinals locked in by the Count of Poitiers. Here Humbert II, the last Dauphin of Vienne (1348), made an assignment of his States to Charles, eldest son of the Duke of Normandy. In 1495, Charles VIII and his wife lived in the monastery. After the Revolution of 1789, the monastery was used as cars shed. Attempts to reestablish the cult and to create a parish named St. Pothin were unsuccessful.The Jacobins church was built over a period from 1657 to 1689 and, in the same time, a big portal added by architect Antoine Lepautre allowed the building to reach great notoriety, and famous people attended the offices, including Louis XII in 1501 and the Queen Mother in 1579. The convent was rebuilt in 1714 and eventually nationalized in 1793. A land contiguous to the chapel was sold in 1725 and bought by Vingtrinier in 1779, then by the State in 1822. The church was demolished in 1818 and the convent housed the prefecture of the Rhone from 1812 to 1852 under the leadership of prefect of Rh\u00f4ne Pierre de Bondy (and thus the street was renamed Place de la Pr\u00e9fecture at the time).Notable events that occurred on the square include executions of political opponents on 15 March 1590, a big firework to celebrate the peace in 1713, and shows by a temporary theater built by Falconnet and\nFarge in 1834, quickly destroyed by a fire.The square was enlarged twice: first in 1824, during the creation of the rue Centrale, built by the architects Beno\u00eet Poncet and Jean-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Savoye; then in 1860, when the square became trapezoidal as the rue Gasparin was opened and new buildings were added. Some mosaics found on the square provided indications of what Roman houses looked like.In 2004, a plaque recounting its history was added to the square.\n\n\n=== Cross and well ===\nOriginally, there was a cross on the square, but it was removed in 1562 by the Protestants. Subsequently, a formal approval in 1599 allowed to rebuild a cross, and between 1603 and 1609, Philippe Lalyame erected a pyramidal obelisk surmounted by a cross representing the Trinity and with the God's name in at least 24 languages. During the 1662 civil war, the Protestants considered this monument as a symbol of religious freedom and did not destroy it. After an urgent request by all residents of the quarter, based on the fact that this monument \"[was] one of the oldest in th[e] city\", this antiquated pyramid was rebuilt in 1739 by the consulate that also did add an inscription celebrating Louis XV. During the French Revolution, the pyramid was destroyed on 9 March 1793; only the pedestal of the fountain remained until 1813.\nHorace Cardon, who lived here, rebuilt the well in 1614 at his own expense. About one century later, the well was no longer sufficient for all the inhabitants of the neighborhood, especially in case of fire, and thus Antoine-Michel Perrache was entrusted to erect a new pump in 1759-60.\n\n\n=== Fountain ===\n\nA fountain was erected in 1856 by Louis Danton, a wealthy upholsterer, who bequeathed his fortune for a work designed by Lienard and melted by Barbezat. In 1866, when the rue Imp\u00e9riale (now rue \u00c9douard-Herriot) was opened, this rendered obsolete the fountain which was removed.A new fountain, designed by Desjardins, was inaugurated in 1868 to commemorate Claude-Marius Va\u00efsse but this politician was not liked and the fountain diameter (41.75 meters) was deemed as too excessive. At the fall of the Second Empire in 1870, the statue was not yet installed and was hidden in the customs warehouse. The statue could have been recast to erect that of Claude Bernard, which was never done, but it was recast without glory in 1902. The circle of the fountain of Desjardins was disassembled and reassembled in 1877 on the Place Carnot to host the fountain of the Republic until its final destruction in 1975 during the re-development of the square and the construction of the subway of Lyon. It was decided in 1877 to build a new fountain on the Place des Jacobins : a competition was launched from 18 January to 30 June.The city council decided to \"give to the Place des Jacobins and Lyon (Place de la R\u00e9publique) a monument\". Two \"second prizes\" were awarded, one to Gaspard Andr\u00e9 for his project name \"Art\". He was appointed to lead the final study, and his project, presented on 28 February 1878, was approved in May. On 17 June 1878, a second competition attributed to Degeorges the creation of the four main statues : the statue of Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin was created in Paris and the other three, the statues of G\u00e9rard Audran, Guillaume Coustou and Philibert de l'Orme were carved in Lyon. The four artists are represented with their respective clothes. Although the contract scheduled the completion for 1 November 1878, the statues were not completed until 1885. The works took place on 20 December 1881 and the monument was inaugurated on 14 July 1885. The fountain was included in the supplementary inventory of monument historiques (ISMH, 18/05/1992).\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nMost buildings of the square are wealthy, with five decorated floors; and built circa 1850. The No. 1 was built in 1860 after plans by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ginioz. The No. 4 of the Place des Jacobins is the painter Paul Borel's house, conducted by architect Pierre Bossan in 1863.To the east, there is a large house, and in front, three small older ones. To the north, the building has slate roofs and, to the south-west, an eleven-storey building with rounded balconies.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2nd arrondissement of Lyon\nGaspard Andr\u00e9\nList of streets and squares in Lyon\nWorld Heritage Site\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Style Louis XIV or Louis Quatorze ( LOO-ee ka-TORZ, -\u2060 k\u0259-, French: [lwi kat\u0254\u0281z] (listen)), also called French classicism, was the style of architecture and decorative arts intended to glorify King Louis XIV and his reign. It featured majesty, harmony and regularity.  It became the official style during the reign of Louis XIV (1643\u20131715), imposed upon artists by the newly established Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) and the Acad\u00e9mie royale d'architecture (Royal Academy of Architecture). It had an important influence upon the architecture of other European monarchs, from Frederick the Great of Prussia to Peter the Great of Russia. Major architects of the period included Fran\u00e7ois Mansart, Jules Hardouin Mansart, Robert de Cotte, Pierre Le Muet, Charles Perrault, and Louis Le Vau. Major monuments included the Palace of Versailles, the Grand Trianon at Versailles, and the Church of Les Invalides (1675\u201391).\nThe Louis XIV style had three periods. During the first period, which coincided with the youth of the King (1643-1660) and the regency of Anne of Austria, architecture and art were strongly influenced by the earlier style of Louis XIII and by the Baroque style imported from Italy. The early period saw the beginning of French classicism, particularly in the early works of Francois Mansart, such as the Chateau de Maisons (1630\u201351). During the second period (1660-1690), under the personal rule of the King, the style of architecture and decoration became more classical, triumphant and ostentatious, expressed in the building of the Chateau of Versailles, first by Louis Le Vau and then Jules Hardouin-Mansart. Until 1680, furniture was massive, decorated with a profusion of sculpture and gilding. In the later period, thanks to the development of the craft of marquetry, the furniture was decorated with different colors and different woods. The most prominent creator of furniture in the later period was Andr\u00e9 Charles Boulle. The final period of Louis XIV style, from about 1690 to 1715, is called the period of transition; it was influenced by Hardouin-Mansart and by the King's designer of fetes and ceremonies, Jean B\u00e9rain the Elder. The new style was lighter in form, and featured greater fantasy and freedom of line, thanks in part to the use of wrought iron decoration, and greater use of arabesque, grotesque  and coquille designs, which continued into the style of Louis XV.\n\n\n== Civil architecture ==\nThe model of civil architecture in the early part of the reign was Vaux le Vicomte (1658), by Louis Le Vau, built for the King's chief of finance Nicolas Fouquet and completed in 1658. Louis XIV charged Fouquet with theft, put him prison, and took the building for himself. The design was strongly influenced by the classicism of Fran\u00e7ois Mansart. It combined a facade dominated and rhymed by colossal classical columns, beneath a dome, imported from the Italian Baroque architecture, along with a number of original features, such as a semicircular salon which looked out on the vast French formal garden created by Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre.Based on the success of Vaux le Vicomte, Louis XIV selected Le Vau to construct an immense new palace at Versailles, to augment a smaller palace transformed from a hunting lodge by Louis XIII. This gradually became, over the decades, the master work of the Louis XIV style. Following the death of Le Vau in 1680, Jules Hardouin-Mansart took over the Versailles project; he broke away from the picturesque projections and dome and made a more sober and uniform facade of columns, with a flat roof topped by a balustrade and row of columns (1681). He used the same style to harmonize the other new buildings he created at Versailles, including the Orangerie and the Stables. Hardouin-Mansart constructed the Grand Trianon (completed 1687), single-story royal retreat with arched windows alternating with pairs of columns, and a flat roof and balustrade.\nAnother major new project undertaken by Louis was the construction of a new facade for the east side of the Louvre. In 1665 Louis invited the most famous sculptor architect of the Italian Baroque, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, to submit a design, but in 1667 rejected it in favor of a more sober and classical colonnade, designed by a committee of three, comprising Louis Le Vau, Charles Le Brun, and Claude Perrault.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Religious architecture ==\nIn the early period of his reign, Louis began building the church of Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce (1645\u20131710), the chapel of the Val-de-Grace hospital. The design was worked on successively by Mansart, Jacques Lemercier and Pierre Le Muet before being completed by Gabriel Leduc. Its picturesque tripartite facade, peristyle, detached columns, statues, and tondi, make it the most Italianate and Baroque of Paris churches. It served as the prototype for the later domes of Les Invalides and the Pantheon.The next major church built under Louis XIV was the church of Les Invalides (1680\u20131706). The nave of the church, by Lib\u00e9ral Bruant, was comparable to those of other churches of the period, with ionic pilasters and penetrating vaults, and an interior that resembled the high baroque style. The dome, by Hardouin-Mansart, was more revolutionary, sitting upon a structure with the plan of a Greek Cross. The design used superimposed orders of columns, in the classical style, but the dome achieved greater height, by resting on a double tambouror drum, and the facade and dome itself were richly decorated with sculptures, entablements in niches, and ornaments of gilded bronze alternating with the nervures, or ribs of the dome.The finest church interior of the late Louis XIV period is the chapel of the Chateau of Versailles, created between 1697 and 1710 by Hardouin-Mansart and his successor as court architect, Robert de Cotte.  The decor was carefully restrained, with light colors and sculptural detail in slight relief on the columns.  The interior of the chapel opened up and lightened by the use of classical columns placed on the tribune, one level above the ground floor, to support the weight of the vaulted ceiling.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== The Grand Style: Paris ==\nThough Louis XIV was later accused of having ignored Paris, his reign saw several massive architectural projects which opened up space and ornamented the center of the city. The idea of monumental urban squares surrounded by uniform architecture had begun in Italy, like many architectural ideas of Baroque period. The first such square in Paris was the Place Royal (now Place des Vosges) begun by Henry IV of France, completed with an equestrian statue of Louis XIII; then the Place Dauphine on the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, which featured an equestrian statue of Henry IV. The initial grand Paris projects of Louis XIV were new facades on the Louvre, one facing the Seine, the other facing to the east. These were showcases of the new monumental style of Louis XIV. The old brick and stone of the Henry IV squares was replaced by the Grand Style of monumental columns, which usually were part of the facade itself, rather than standing separately. All the buildings around the square were connected and built to the same height, in the same style. The ground floor featured a covered arcade for pedestrians.The first such complex of buildings built under Louis XIV was the Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations (now the Institut de France) (1662\u201368), facing the Louvre. It was designed by Louis Le Vau and Fran\u00e7ois d'Orbay, and combined the headquarters of the academies founded by the King, a chapel, and the library of Cardinal Mazarin. The H\u00f4tel Royal des Invalides \u2013 a complex for war veterans consisting of residences, a hospital, and a chapel \u2013 was constructed by Lib\u00e9ral Bruant and Jules Hardouin-Mansart (1671\u20131679). Louis XIV then commissioned Mansart to construct a separate private royal chapel featuring a striking dome, the \u00c9glise du D\u00f4me, which was added to complete the complex in 1708.\nThe next major project was the Place des Victoires (1684-1697), a real estate development of seven large buildings in three segments around an oval square, with an equestrian statue of Louis XIV planned for the centerpiece. This was built by an enterprising entrepreneur and nobleman of the court, Jean-Baptiste Pr\u00e9dot, combined with the architect Jules Haroudin-Mansart. The final urban project became the best-known, the Place Vend\u00f4me, also by Harouin-Mansart, between 1699 and 1702. In another innovation, this project was partially financed by the sale of lots around the square. All of these projects featured monumental facades in the Louis XIV style, giving a particular harmony to the squares.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Interior decoration ==\nIn the early Louis XIV style, the principle characteristics of decor were a richness of materials and an effort to achieve a monumental effect. The materials used included marble, often combined with multicolor stones, bronze, paintings, and mirrors. These were inserted into an extremely framework of columns, pilasters, niches, which extended up the walls and up upon the ceiling. The doors were surrounded with medallions, frontons and bas-reliefs. The chimneys were smaller than those during the Louis XIII era, but more ornate, with a marble shelf supporting vases, below a carved frame with a painting or mirrors, all surrounded by a thick border of carved leaves or flowers.\nDecorative elements on the walls of the early Louis XIV style were usually intended to celebrate the military success, majesty and cultural achievements of the King. They often featured military trophies, with helmets, oak leaves symbolizing victory, and masses of weapons, usually made of glided bronze or sculpted wood, in relief surrounded by marble. Other decorative elements celebrated the King personally: the head of the King was often represented as the sun god Apollo, surrounded by palm leaves or gilded rays of light. An eagle usually represented Jupiter. Other ornamental details included gilded numbers, royal batons, and crowns.\nThe Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles (1678\u20131684) was the summit of the early Louis XIV style.  Designed by Charles Le Brun, it combined a richness of materials (marble, gold, and bronze) which reflected in the mirrors.\nIn the late Louis XIV period, after 1690, new elements began to appear, that were less militaristic and more fantastic; particularly seashells, surrounded by elaborate sinuous lines and curves; and exotic designs, including arabesques and Chinoiserie.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Furniture ==\n\nDuring the first period of the reign of Louis XIV, furniture followed the previous style of Louis XIII, and was massive, and profusely decorated with sculpture and gilding. After 1680, thanks in large part to the furniture designer Andr\u00e9 Charles Boulle, a more original and delicate style appeared, sometimes known as Boulle work. It was based on the inlay of ebony and other rare woods, a technique first used in Florence in the 15th century, which was refined and developed by Boulle and others working for Louis XIV.  Furniture was inlaid with plaques of ebony, copper, and exotic woods of different colors.New and often enduring types of furniture appeared;  the commode, with two to four drawers, replaced the old coffre, or chest. The canap\u00e9, or sofa, appeared, in the form of a combination of two or three armchairs. New kinds of armchairs appeared, including the fauteuil en confessionale or \"Confessional armchair\", which had padded cushions ions on either side of the back of the chair.  The console table also made its first appearance; it was designed to be placed against a wall. Another new type of furniture was the table \u00e0 gibier, a marble-topped table for holding dishes. Early varieties of the desk appeared; the Mazarin desk had a central section set back, placed between two columns of drawers, with four feet on each column.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Ceramics ==\nAfter about 1650, Nevers faience (tin-glazed earthenware), which had long made wares in the Italian maiolica istoriato style, adopted the new French Court style, borrowing from metalwork and other decorative arts, and using prints after the new generation of court painters such as Simon Vouet and Charles Lebrun for the images, which were also painted in many colours.  The pieces were often extremely large and ornate, and apart from garden vases and wine-coolers, no doubt decorative rather than practical.In 1663 Colbert, recently made Louis XIV's finance minister, made a note that the other leading centre of French faience, Rouen faience, should be protected and encouraged, sent designs, and given commissions by the king.  Around 1670 the Rouen factory of the Poterat family received part of the large and prestigous commissions for Louis XIV's Trianon de porcelaine, a small palace whose walls were largely covered in painted tiles, in fact of faience rather than porcelain, which was demolished not long after.  Nevers and other centres shared these commissions, and others for large fittings and decorations for Loius's other palaces. Nevers garden vases in blue and white were prominently used in the gardens of the Chateau de Versailles.The French faience industry received another huge boost when, late in Louis's reign in 1709, the king pressured the wealthy to donate their silver plate, previously what they normally used to dine, to his treasury to help pay for his wars.  They was an \"overnight frenzy\" as the elite rushed to get faience replacements of the best quality.The reign also saw the earliest French porcelain in Rouen porcelain, although production was on a tiny scale; only nine small pieces are thought to survive.   The next factory, Saint-Cloud porcelain, from perhaps 1695 onwards, was more successful, though it was only in the following reign that French porcelain was produced in quantity.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Painting ==\nIn the first part of the reign, French painters were largely influenced by the Italians, particularly Caravaggio. Notable French painters included Nicolas Poussin, who was living in Rome; Claude Lorrain, who specialized in landscapes and spent most of his career in Rome; Louis Le Nain, who, along with his brothers, did mostly genre works; Eustache Le Sueur, and Charles Le Brun, who studied with Poussin in Rome and were influenced by him.\nWith the death in 1661 of Cardinal Mazarin, the King's prime minister, Louis decided to take personal charge of all aspects of government, including the arts. His chief advisor on the arts was Jean Colbert (1619\u20131683), who was also his finance minister. In 1663 Colbert reorganized the Royal furniture workshops, which made a wide variety of luxury goods, and added to it the Gobelins tapestry workshops. At the same time, with the assistance of Le Brun, Colbert took charge of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, which had been founded by Cardinal Mazarin. Colbert also took a dominant role in architecture, taking the title of Superintendent of buildings in 1664. In 1666, the French Academy in Rome was founded, to take advantage of Rome's position as the leading art center of Europe, and to assure a stream of well-trained painters. Le Brun became the dean of French painters under Louis XIV, involved in architectural projects and interior design.  His notable decorative works included the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles.The major painters of the later reign of Louis XIV included Hyacinthe Rigaud (1659\u20131743) who came to Paris in 1681, and attracted the attention of LeBrun.  LeBrun oriented him toward portrait painting, and he made a celebrated portrait of Louis XIV in 1701, surrounded by all the attributes of power, from the crown on the table to the red heels of his shoes. Rigaud soon had an elaborate workshop in place for making portraits of the nobility; he employed specialized artists to create the costumes and draperies, and others to paint the backgrounds, ranging from battlefields to gardens to salons, while he concentrated on the composition, colors and especially the faces.George de la Tour (1593\u20131652) was another important figure in the Louis XIV style; he was given a title, named court painter of the King, and received high payments for his portraits, though he rarely ever came to Paris, preferring to work in his home town of Lun\u00e9ville. His paintings, with their unusual light and dark effects, were unusually somber, the figures barely seen in the darkness, lit by torchlight, evoking meditation and pity. In addition to religious scenes, he did genre paintings, including the famous Tricheur or card cheat, showing a young noble being cheated at cards while others look on passively. The writer and later French culture minister Andre Malraux wrote in 1951, \"No other painter, not even Rembrandt, ever suggested such a vast and mysterious silence. La Tour is the only interpreter of the serene aspect of shadows.\"In his final years, Louis XIV's tastes changed again, under the influence of his morganic wife, Madame de Maintenon, toward more religious and meditative themes. He had all the paintings in his private room removed and replaced by a single canvas, Saint Sebastien being tended by Saint Irene (c. 1649) by Georges de la Tour.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sculpture ==\nThe most influential sculptor of the period was the Italian Gian Lorenzo Bernini, whose work in Rome inspired sculptors all over Europe. He traveled to France; his proposal for a new facade of the Louvre was rejected by the King, who wanted a more specifically French style, but the Bernini did make a bust of Louis XIV in 1665 which was greatly admired and imitated in France.\nOne of the most prominent sculptors under Louis XIV was Antoine Coysevox (pronounced \"qualzevo\") (1640\u20131720) from Lyon. He studied sculpture under Louis Lerambert and copied in marble ancient Roman works, including the Venus de Medici. In 1776, his bust of the King's official painter Charles Le Brun won him admission to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. He was soon producing monumental sculpture to accompany the new buildings constructed by Louis XIV; he made a Charlemagne for the royal chapel at Les Invalides, and then a large number of statues for the new Park at Versailles and then at the Chateau de Marly. He originally made the outdoor statues in weather-resistant stucco, then replaced them with marble works when they were finished in 1705. His work of Neptune from Marly is now in the Louvre, and his statues of Pan and a Flora and Dryad are now found in the Tuileries Gardens. His statue of The King's Fame riding Pegasus was originally made for the Chateau of Marly. After the Revolution it was moved to the Tuileries Gardens, and is now inside the Louvre. He also made a series of greatly admired portrait sculptures of the leading statesmen and artists of the time; Louis XIV at Versailles, Colbert (for his tomb at the Church of Saint Eustache; Cardinal Mazarin in the Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations (now the Institut de France) in Paris; the playwright Jean Racine; the architect Vauban and the garden designer Andre Le Notre.Jacques Sarazin was another notable sculptor working on projects for Louis XIV. He made many statues and decorations for the Palace of Versailles, as well as the Caryatids for the eastern facade of the Pavilion du Horloge of the Louvre, facing the Cour Carr\u00e9, which were based both on a study of the original Greek models, and on the work of Michelangelo.\nAnother notable sculptor of the Style Louis XV was Pierre Paul Puget (1620\u20131694), who was a sculptor, painter, engineer and architect. He was born in Marseille, and first sculpted ornaments for ships under construction. He then travelled to Italy, where he worked as an apprentice on the Baroque ceilings of the Palazzo Barberini and Palazzo Pitti. He travelled back and forth between Italy and France, painting, sculpting and wood-carving. He made his celebrated statue of caryatids for the city hall of Toulon in 1665\u201367, then was employed by Nicolas Fouquet to make a statue of Hercules for his chateau at Vaux-le-Vicomte. He continued to live in the south of France, making notable statues of Milo of Croton, Perseus and Andromeda (now in the Louvre).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Tapestries ==\nIn 1662 Jean Baptiste Colbert purchased the tapestry workshop of a family of Flemish artisans and transformed it into a royal workshop for the manufacture of furniture and tapestries, under the name of Gobelins tapestry. Colbert placed the workshop under the direction of the royal court painter, Charles Le Brun, who served in that position from 1663 until 1690. The workshop worked closely with the major painters of the court, who produced the designs. After 1697 the enterprise was reorganized, and thereafter was devoted entirely to the production of tapestries for the King.The themes and styles of the tapestry were largely similar to the themes in the paintings of the period, celebrating the majesty of the King and triumphal scenes of military victories, mythological and pastoral scenes. While at first they were made only for use of the King and nobility, the factory soon began exporting its products to the other courts of Europe.\nThe royal Gobelins manufactory had competition from two private enterprises, the Beauvais Manufactory and the Aubusson tapestry workshop, which produced works in the same style but with a low-warp process, with slightly lesser quality. Jean B\u00e9rain the Elder, the royal draftsman and designer of the King, created a series of grotesque carpets for Aubusson. These tapestries sometimes celebrated contemporary themes, such as a work designed by Aubusson An late 17th to early 18th century tapestry done by the Beauvais Manufactory depicting Chinese astronomers at the Beijing Ancient Observatory using new more accurate instruments brought to them by Europeans (Jesuits) which were installed in 1644.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Design and spectacle ==\nIn the early years of the King's reign, the most important public royal ceremony was the carrousel,  a series of exercises and games on horseback. These events were designed to replace the tournament, which had been banned after 1559 when King Henry II was killed in a jousting accident. In the new, less dangerous version, riders usually had to pass their lance through the interior of a ring, or strike mannequins with the heads of Medusa, Moors and Turks. A grand carrousel was held on June 5\u20136, 1662 to celebrate the birth of the Dauphin, the son of Louis XIV. It was held on the square separating the Louvre from the Tuileries Palace, which afterwards became known as the Place du Carrousel.The ceremonial entry of the King into Paris also became an occasion for festivities. The return of Louis XIV and Queen Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se to Paris after his coronation in 1660 was celebrated by a grand event on a fairground at the gates of the city, where large thrones were constructed for the new monarchs. After the ceremony the site became known as the Place du Tr\u00f4ne, or place of the Throne, until it became the Place de la Nation in 1880.An office existed in the royal household of Louis XIV called Menus-Plaisirs du Roi, which was responsible the decoration at royal ceremonies and spectacles, including ballets, masques, illuminations, fireworks, theater performances and other entertainments. This office was held from 1674 to 1711 by Jean B\u00e9rain the Elder (1640-1711). He was also designer of the King's bedchamber and offices, and had an enormous influence upon what became known as the Style Louis XIV; his studio was located in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre, along with those of the royal furniture designer Andr\u00e9 Charles Boulle. He was particularly responsible for introducing the a modified version of the grotesque style of ornament, originally created in Italy by Raphael, into French interior design. He used the grotesque stele not only on wall panels, but also on tapestries made by the Aubusson tapestry workshops. His many varied other designs included the highly-ornate design of transom of the warship Soleil Royal (1670), named for the King.In addition to interior decoration, he designed the costumes and scenery for the royal theaters, including for the opera Amadis by Jean-Baptiste Lully performed at the Theater of the Palais Royal (1684), and for the opera-ballet Les Saisons by Lully's successor, Pascal Colasse, in 1695.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== The garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise ==\nOne of the most enduring and popular forms of the Style Louis XIV is the jardin \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise or French formal garden, a style based on symmetry and the principle of imposing order on nature. The most famous example is the Gardens of Versailles designed by Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre, which inspired copies all across Europe. The first important garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise was the Chateau of Vaux-le-Vicomte, created for Nicolas Fouquet, the superintendent of Finances to Louis XIV, beginning in 1656. Fouquet commissioned Louis Le Vau to design the chateau, Charles Le Brun to design statues for the garden, and Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre to create the gardens. For the first time the garden and the chateau were perfectly integrated. A grand perspective of 1500 meters extended from the foot of the chateau to the statue of the Hercules of Farnese; and the space was filled with parterres of evergreen shrubs in ornamental patterns, bordered by colored sand, and the alleys were decorated at regular intervals by statues, basins, fountains, and carefully sculpted topiaries.  \"The symmetry attained at Vaux achieved a degee of perfection and unity rarely equalled in the art of classic gardens. The chateau is at the center of this strict spatial organization which symbolizes power and success.\"The Gardens of Versailles, created by Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre between 1662 and 1700, were the greatest achievement of the French formal garden. They were the largest gardens in Europe, with an area of 15,000 hectares, and were laid out on an east\u2013west axis followed the course of the sun: the sun rose over the Court of Honor, lit the Marble Court, crossed the Chateau and lit the bedroom of the King, and set at the end of the Grand Canal, reflected in the mirrors of the Hall of Mirrors. In contrast with the grand perspectives, reaching to the horizon, the garden was full of surprises: fountains, small gardens filled with statuary, which provided a more human scale and intimate spaces. The central symbol of the garden was the sun; the emblem of Louis XIV, illustrated by the statue of Apollo in the central fountain of the garden. \"The views and perspectives, to and from the palace, continued to infinity. The king ruled over nature, recreating in the garden not only his domination of his territories, but over the court and his subjects.\"\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nLouis period styles\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nYves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, L'art des jardins en Europe, Citadelles et Mazenod, Paris, 2006\nBauer, Hermann; Prater, Andreas (2016), Baroque (in French), Cologne: Taschen, ISBN 978-3-8365-4748-2\nCabanne, Perre (1988), L'Art Classique et le Baroque, Paris: Larousse, ISBN 978-2-03-583324-2\nDucher, Robert (1988), Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles, Paris: Flammarion, ISBN 2-08-011539-1\nFierro, Alfred (1996).

        "wiki": "The occupation of Saint - Nizier church by Lyon prostitutes refers to the ten-day occupation of the Saint-Nizier Church in Lyon by more than a hundred prostitutes on 2 June 1975 to draw attention to their inhumane working conditions. The occupation lasted eight days until the women were removed by the police on 10 June. Sympathetic occupations of churches by prostitutes followed in Paris, Marseille, Grenoble, Saint-\u00c9tienne and Montpellier.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the 1970s, French police kept sex workers under increasing pressure. The police reprisals forced sex workers to work increasingly in secret. As a result, protection of sex workers decreased and led to more violence against them. In April 1975, the Lyon prostitutes started to organise themselves and their leader, \"Ulla\" appeared on television to publicise the women's demands. After three murders and the unwillingness of the government to improve the situation, sex workers in Lyon took action.\n\n\n== Occupation ==\nOn 2 June 1975 more than 100 prostitutes occupied the Saint-Nizier church in rue de Brest and went on strike. They demanded the end of fines, police harassment and the release from jail of ten of them who had been imprison a few days earlier for soliciting. The striking workers sang political chants and demanded decent working conditions and an end to stigma.\nThe occupation made national headlines and was reported internationally. Local people supported the woman and brought clothes and food. The occupation received support from political, union and feminist organisations. Abolitionists, in the form of the Movement du Nid, also supported the occupation, hoping the public awareness it raised would help end prostitution.The parish priest, the Rev. Antonin Bdal, refused to call the police to remove the women. However, acting on Government orders, the police forcibly cleared the church after eight days on 10 June. The Minister of the Interior, Michel Poniatowski, claimed the women had been manipulated into the occupation by pimps, and the Women rights Minister, Fran\u00e7oise Giroud, refused to meet with the women and claimed she was not competent in the matter. The leader of the Movement, \"Ulla\", had her real name and photograph printed in the press.The event marks the starting point of an international movement of sex workers for sex workers' rights.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe occupation is remembered every year on 2 June as International Whores' Day.A journalist working for Lib\u00e9ration, Claude Jaget, followed the occupation. In addition to his articles in Lib\u00e9ration, he later published a book: Une vie de putain. This book gathers six testimonies, from among the prostitutes who participated in the occupation of the church.In 2016, a play, Loveless, written by Anne Buffet and Yann Dacosta, an adaptation of the book, Une vie de putain, was enacted at the National Dramatic Center of Normandy-Rouen it was also staged in Lyon at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des C\u00e9lestins in 2018.\n\n\n== See also ==\nProstitution in France\nSex workers' rights\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBasaran, Tugba; Bigo, Didier; Guittet, Emmanuel-Pierre; Walker, R.

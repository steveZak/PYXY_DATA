        "wiki": "Valle de la Luna (Moon Valley) is situated about 10 kilometers from downtown La Paz, in the Pedro Domingo Murillo Province, La Paz Department, Bolivia.  It consists of an area where erosion has worn away the majority of a mountain, composed primarily of clay rather than rock, leaving tall spires.  It is similar to another zone of La Paz that is known as El Valle de las Animas (The Valley of the Souls). It is an important site of the famous holiday, Dias de los Muertos (Day of the Dead).Because the mineral content of the mountains varies greatly between individual mountains, the sides of the mountains are different colors, creating striking optical illusions. A majority of them are a clear beige or light brown color, but some are almost red, with sections of dark violet.\n\n\n== See also ==\nValle de la Luna, Potos\u00ed, Bolivia (El Sillar)",

          "Amazing place to visit within the city limits of LaPaz. It is a little high in altitude so be careful and take it slow. There is a good amount of terrain to explore with tow options, a short loop and a long loop. It closes fairly early so make sure that you plan enough time to",
          "Beautiful place with spectacular views if on a clear day. We were told it got damaged due to social conflict last year but it is perfectly safe now. i would suggest fixing the hand rails which look worn down and not so safe. Also better signs are needed in order to know where to",
          "This geological wonder is in the center of La Paz. Was well worth the visit! Get there with enough time to wander the entire park.",
          "Spent 30.min there as part of a guided visit. Like it. The valley is quiet unique setting and gives as well a partial look onto La Paz. For me it is between 3 and 4 stars. 3 is not enough and 4 is a bit over rated.",
          "Very interesting place. Although there are many Moon and Mars canyions in the region, this one with its columns is completely unique. The atmosphere is somewhat ruined by the smell of rabbit faeces that live there. In addition, it is impossible to buy water in the canyon and the",
          "Yes, it's a nice spot, you make some pictures - and thats it. Around the corner, following the trail - it's all the same. No information boards about this special erosion that has worn away the majority of a mountain. Where are all the rocks? - or was it only \"clay-mountains\"?",
          "My friend and I were able to hire a taxi driver to take us there and it only cost about $50 US for three hours! It is quite a fascinating place. He also stopped at places along the way to show us stuff and took us to a zoo with llamas and alpacas, as well as other animals",
          "Given how hyped up the Valle de la Luna was in a lot of articles I read about La Paz before visiting, and how frequently it seems to be advertised by tourist offices around the city, I did expect it to be easier to get to. Obviously, we weren't going to pay a large sum of money",
          "This is definitely worth a visit. You can go on your own between 9-1. In the afternoon you need a reservation and then for sunset you have to go by tour. We had our own car and didn't want to pay for a tour so we had to miss the sunset here unfortunately..",
          "Beautiful natural monument, but there's lack of written informations if you decide to make a tour without a guide. A must-to-see in La Paz!",
          "Truly like being on the moon I would imagine. A large clay pan shaped by wind and water to form amazing valleys. A short drive out of La Paz it is easy to access. Not for anyone with mobility issues. Wonderful scenery. A few cacti which it seems will grow anywhere, but otherwise",
          "The view is stunning. You need about 45min to do the big circuit. A nice half day trip. Would visit again for sure!",
          "Cool to see - it\u2019s a 45minute walking track through an amazing valley and you can get some incredible photos. You don\u2019t need a tour to do this, we went to the bottom of the green line on Mi Teleferico, and caught a minivan ($2.50 Bolivianos)or you can grab a taxi ($20) - Entry",
          "Great view from the park, not hard to get there by your own , and entrance fee is fair for the placer, only thing Carry some snacks :)",
          "I always enjoy visiting Valle de la Luna. My in-laws live in San Miguel, so it's an easy trip and wonderful way to spend a couple of hours on a nice day. I also recommend lunch at Hotel Oberland a few kilometers down the road on the way to Mallasa.",
          "It was ehh...but the pictures you take are awesome! You can take a cab and have him stay as you will only need 30 minutes max.",
          "This is a sight to see and the landscape is so different then the rest of the area . Well worth the low cost and a little time to go visit it .",
          "Amassing, different, non earthly landscape, where you can take unique and unusual pictures. Put this on your \"to visit list\"! There is parking area, shop, toilet, taxi service.",
          "This landscape is worth the effort to see. Get a taxi and have them wait for you while you walk through this weird and amazing natural environment. It can be hot when walking so take water.",
          "Went there by taxi. Our driver waited for us. Easy to buy ticket. There are toilet facilities on the inside. Water and snacks available. I would recommend to this as a thing to see whilst in la Paz. It does not take very long to het there. When we visited there were not many",
          "Easy to get to. Catch a bus from near basilica. Good for an morning out afternoon, interesting shapes.",
          "We did the 2 hours jeep tour in the valley, I've seen better views in south america and in bolivia. Not a must visit",
          "Valley of the Moon is really interesting. The landscape is supposedly really similar to the moon's landscape. It is really nice to wander around and has some really nice scenery and good photo opportunities.",
          "A nice parc to spend some time in and enjoy the geological formations there. It is located a bit outside of the city, be sure to take a good taxi to join it if you don't have a car!",
          "We first heard about Moon Valley from our guide at Lake Titicaca. We were all excited when we saw it was included on our half day tour. It seemed a long trek for nothing too exciting. Yes it was more bizarre than beautiful, it just didn't float my boat. I did take a number of",
          "We went here on the local bus, as part of a tour with a guide. We spent about 45 minutes walking through the landscape as she explained the naming and development of the area. It was interesting and unusual. Take water with you as it gets quite hot during the day. We liked",
          "I was not too impressed with these formations as I am a veteran of photographing rock formations in the Southwest. Tough place to photograph as you have to deal with development all around the formations.",
          "We went by ourselves. It's not so hard to get here a taxi charged us 50 Bolivian money to get there and we were able to stay as long as we wanted. With an agency you just stay like 1 hour so better alone",
          "Really worth visiting. We did not hike the area only drove and admired the view. Breathtaking and quiet.",
          "This place is worth popping up to but it is quite a trek away from central La Paz! The structures are quite something... like a mini Wild West but it is surrounded now by buildings which to me significantly detracts from the beauty. Or perhaps that\u2019s just orientating you to",
          "I did this on one of my last days in La Paz as part of a full day tour that also covered Cachaltaya abandoned ski resort. The landscape here is certainly intriguing and worth a visit. I would say photos can't really capture the outerworldiness that you see in person. The",
          "Part of the la paz day trip first stop here. This is not actually a valley but a fantastic landscape of gullies and spires formed from an ancient bed of eroded rock where you will see eroded geological formations which look something like a desert of stalagmites.",
          "There's only one way to experience this geological inspiration and that is by two wheels and motor. not for beginners but for seasoned, confident riders who know well how to be careful while having fun. Ride free or die.",
          "It\u2019s a good place to visit if you have time in La Paz and don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s pretty small, you visit it in about 1h. No need to take a tour as the collectivo go up there for 5bob !",
          "Really interesting site located about 40 mins taxi ride for centre of La Paz. Our hotel organised a taxi to and from the site and our driver waited outside whilst we explored! (Cost 160 BOB) We took the 45 minute loop option and it wasn\u2019t a strenuous walk but offered some really",
          "The moon valley does not take the much time to do and can be done pretty quickly. The scenery is so unique for a city that it is worth visiting and walking around.",
          "We did the short version of the tour as we were running short on time. Clearly, a very interesting place which I can imagine looks a lot like the surface of the moon. Definitely worth the 30 or so minutes we spent there.",
          "You miss nothing if you have not been there. A far better opcion is take the bus to valle de las animas about 40 \u00f1in out of town.",
          "Awesome day trip and worth the 15 bolivianos. Definitely take the local collectivos which are like car shares. No need to pay a tour company commission.",
          "Really great to walk around there. It can easily be reached from La Paz with the public bus. You don't have to do a tour to see it.",
          "It not cool. It is far from downtonw, we got a huge traffic to get there . Neil Armstrong visited L\u00e1 Paz in 60's and while playing golf saw the site and sad that the place looks like the Moon surface. Do not waste your time.",
          "After spending a day on the Teleferico cable cars, we decided to head out to the Valley. We took a short taxi ride from the green station but only stayed less than 30mins as this park was insignificant especially after visiting Machu Picchu and the Sacred Valley. You can give",
          "It's a beautiful park with fabulous landscapes. There are lots of trails to walk which give you varied views of the area.",
          "Take the yellow bus out, super cheap, just flag it down outside St Francis Church. Easy walk around, there is only the 1 small tienda outside for snacks and water, nothing inside so if its hot come prepared",
          "A slight challenge of a hike due to the altitude but definitely doable. The views were worth the effort. We saw it late in the afternoon and the sun angle helped with several of the views.",
          "It's a beautiful place, though not the most interesting place I've seen in Bolivia. It's nice to spend a day there.",
          "Easy to do by yourself, get a taxi out and ask it to wait an hour while you walk round. Should cost you Bs80 for the taxi plus Bs 15 to get in. If you have plenty of time go",
          "Interesting rock formations with great views of the snow capped Andes. Only a 15 minute drive from the city, so easily accessible.",
          "Entrance fee is 15 bs and you can walk around1 hour and a half, views is really good and you can take a public car, 45 minutes away from the city",
          "The best place to see something incredible. You are at almost 4000 meters altitude in the mountains ( Andes) and all around you can see mountains of clay. No rocks, just clay. It doesn't have the aspect of the moon but is incredible unreal. You can go with a guide to tour the",
          "Take the Mallasa bus from San Francisco church to Moon Valley, no guide necessary, it's a very interesting place to wander around.",
          "Great place for a walk. Has lots of interesting formations. Also has nice paths with decent rails. Not wheel chair accessible.",
          "This is a place that is just a rock formation that has been weathered for a few million years. They put some paths in and say that Neil Armstrong visited. It is interesting but only for a short period of time.",
          "This is a great place to spend your afternoon in La Paz! It seems very small at first, but we spent much more time than we expected. The attraction was very accessible (aka don't spend money to join tours!) via cable car then taxi. Entrance fee was very affordable, and the",
          "This is such a well preserved and maintained area. It is not developed and maybe it is a bit stark but very much worth the effort",
          "Covering a \"fairly widespread\" area here are these vertical formations (like tall jagged columns although it's hard to determine their heights with their bottoms quite far down below). I walked the full circuit of the site (which takes about 45 minutes but there's the shorter",
          "This is a must to see and visit while in La paz.. So magnificent area with a natural wonder formation from mud. The walkways are so wonderful and beautiful. You can spend hours in this peaceful place. Dont forget your camera, you will take lots of amazing photos. Highly",
          "We went first thing in the morning. A good idea. The place is sort of mind boggling and so close to the city. A must.",
          "We thought it was ok and enjoyed walking about. The entrance was 15 bob each and the taxi was 40 bob each way to our accomodation in downtown La Paz. It wasn as good compared to other options in and around La Paz.",
          "This was a highlight of our trip. You can't imagine this being real, you feel like you are on another planet.",
          "This place actually could be the moon! It was a bit strange but awesome at the same time walking around looking at the craters and massive rock formations. Amazing nature at work again!",
          "We walked all around this moonscape as part of a half day tour of La Pax. Great views. Really interesting geography.",
          "Before you go, review photos taken on the moon. Then, as you walk the narrow pathways you can fully visualize why this is called Moon Valley.",
          "As the name suggests you feel like you are walking on the moon with the ups and down. Something very different and unique. Nice place to visit.",
          "The walk up to the ridge overlooking the surrounding area and amphitheatre was well worth it - fantastic views.",
          "Because l visited Capadocia several times ,this place wasnt impressed me . I am sure there are better places to visit in Bolivia",
          "Valley of the moon is a short taxi ride from the south zone of la Paz (approx 25 BOB). Entry is 15 bob per person. When we went there were only a few groups of people around the park, which made it feel very secluded like we had the place to ourselves. The rock formations",
          "It is a pity. The country lost a World Heritage Site (UNESCO) due to lack of vision. They let citizens build high-standard houses around this archaeological site. It is difficult to take a photograph that does not show houses, streets and cars. A waste of natural beauty.",
          "It is worth a visit as a break from the centre of the city. It is HOT so take water or buy some before you start the short walk. You can get there by public transport, and if you are going to go all that way I suggest you keep going after the attraction to mallasa to get some",
          "It was an interesting aspect for the middle of the city. However, after spending a week in the wild and beautiful countryside, it doesn\u2019t knock your socks off.",
          "Valley of the moon is a beautiful system of giant spires and canyons. The geological formations vary in color from beige to purple. There are walking paths and bridges that take you through the rock formations which are composed mostly of clay and sandstone. It is an interesting",
          "We booked the tour via Loki Boutique with Maya Tours. Just the most awful experience. And dangerous with no regard for the group\u2019s safety and well being. 1. Maya did not show up to pick up a friend from another hostel and refused to go back to get them. 2. The city van that we",
          "For sure this valley is an interesting geolocical formation. And if this is the ground on which La Paz is built, then it would better not rain too much in the next years. Finally we were disappointed because the whole site has the size of an average clay heap an after all we",
          "Our guide told us that this was named by Neil Armstrong as be said it looked like the surface of the moon. Don\u2019t know whether this is true but it\u2019s a nice story anyway. We spent about 40 minutes here, which I thought was about right. Some great photo ops.",
          "In the city. Amazing attraction. You must witness the landscape to absorb the experience. You can get there by city bus or inexpensive taxi ride. A must visit if in La Paz. There really is no way to express the sensation of the moment. Out of this world? Sort of.",
          "valley of the Moon had potential of being a really special landscape. If only the government had the forethought! Only 10 acres is protected, so the place is becoming surrounded by private homes. It is difficult to get a single panorama of the beauty of this place, without",
          "Went here as part of an organised full day tour with Transturin. It is truly a wonder to see, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before and has a real Star wars feel to it so. If you\u2019re in La Paz I\u2019d say it\u2019s an attraction not to miss.",
          "Very interesting and wonderful rock formations... Unlike anything iv seen before. Very easy to reach with public transport. Located in a nice town to visit also.",
          "Great place to visit - amazing that it is minutes away from downtown La Paz. One word of caution though - the steps are irregular, walkways do not have guardrails and watch where you walk as the ground is uneven. Not a problem for us but is you have children with you keep them",
          "Very interesting landscape and ambiance (the day we were there, a Christian Aymara group was recording a song, which echoed soulfully through the rocks. The whole site is lovely, and worth a visit.",
          "Interesting landscape and views. We spent about 2 hours walking around, which was sufficient. The gift shops are cute and have nice and unique items.",
          "It was a huge mountainside rock and sandstone formations with intriguing views. Looks like a NASA scientist who visited the moon expressed that the view he saw there was similar. An intersting place to visit",
          "Take the 20 minute walk and it's a walk; the 45 minute one is a hike. Lots of sandy stone steps but the wooden rails help a lot. Sort of looks like the bottom of a cave or the moon and rumor has it ( but is probably wrong) that it got its name from a visit by Neil Armstrong",
          "Had the place to ourselves. $20 from our hotel by taxi (booked by hotel) and were there and back in two hours having left the hotel at 8am. Beat the traffic by going early and returning before \u201crush hour\u201d at 12:30pm (when everyone goes home for lunch). Interesting landscape and",
          "The Valley of the moon is a really cool place to visit in La Paz. The entrance only costs 15 BOB and you can get there either by taxi, mini bus or take the Teleferico to the last station and from there a mini bus or taxi to the entrance. I recommend to wear comfortable shoes,",
          "We traveled here via taxi. We could've taken the collectivo but were pretty tired and wanted to have get there and back quickly. The taxi waited for us as we walked through the area. The path through the Valley is pretty short so we were in and out within 30 mins or less. The",
          "About half an hour drive pout of town - named by no less than Neil Armstrong! Fascinating landscape with lots of walkways through and around it - wish we'd had more time. Don't be bullied into giving a tip to a musician you haven't asked to play for you!",
          "the Valley of the Moon is unusual geologically - sandstone worn by rain and wind - in a crater formed by glaciers and rivers. Yet it is high, so altitude sickness is a risk. We need some gentle exercise - and this was the place. Entry cost is modest and signage is adequate",
          "I will admit I did not know very much about La Paz before our visit, but this was so very interesting, and, I discovered, has been used as a movie set. If you go, the gifts shops only take cash (USD or Bolivianos), and you may wish to see if admission must also be paid in cash",
          "The valle de la luna or moon valley is a very unusual geologic formation during the glaciers, rain and wind erosion created its forms. Its a nice 45 minute walk. great for pictures, if you are lucky you will see some of the wildlife of the La Paz Valley: hummingbirds, some",
          "While in La Paz we decided to take a look at the Valley of the Moon or Valle de Luna as the locals call it. We booked a cab to take us ther (it's about 30 minutes outside of town depending on traffic), wait for us and bring us back. Round trip 150Bolivian (USD 22). Entrance fee",
          "45 minutes walk in a circular trails with many photo opportunity of the special and unique lime stone and clay formations. a very plesent way to pass an afternoon in La paz. as the city is packed with traffic jams, getting there by texi can take an hour from the touristic",
          "The Valley of the Moon is way down low in La Paz where most of the buildings are up on higher ground. It makes a pleasant walk through the unusual landscape as it can feel like you are really on the moon. Good for many unusual camera shots.",
          "Great geological formations to check out. 15 Bolivianos per person to enter. Not open on rainy days as this contributes to the erosion of the very formations you are heading out to see! You can do 15min loop and / or a 45min loop. We just did the 45min loop as we had limited",
          "We came here as part of a tour. However it rained on the day we visited and we were unable to walk around as it was deemed unsafe. We were allowed in part of it to take photos and it was incredibly slippery so I can understand why we couldn\u2019t walk all the way around. This place",
          "Located just outside La Paz, google to find the easy public transportation way to get there, it is a little bit like a different world. Well maintained you can stroll through this moon like landscape and if you choose your angle properly you even get pictures without",
          "We reached that place by public transportation (mini bus): just jump on a bus heading to \"Mallasa\" (read \"mayasa\") and enjoy your ride of 40mins. After 30 minutes ride we asked the driver to stop at the \"Parc de la Luna\", he called us when we had to leave, and we were right at",
          "I would like to think this once was a huge and beautiful landscape. Now only a small part of it survived (still looking nice), so you can take a walk of about 15 - 45 minutes. But the site is getting totally closed in by quite ugly buildings. We saw them flattening a large piece",
          "I booked this as a tour with Chacaltaya Mountain. But Barro Biking messed up with my booking so I wasn't able to join the tour. My efficient hostel manager advised me that I can take a mini-bus from San Francisco towards Mallasa. It cost me 2.60 Bob. The entrance is a mere 15",
          "Really hot in La Paz spring and we visited moon valley as part of Viator city tour plus Moonvalley. Unique view, natural and walkable paths but the weather was really too hot to do so. Can\u2019t really enjoy the tour. We have seen such view in capadocia but tour guide said it is not",
          "It was a bit of a hike to get out to (we went via taxi in the end) but the terrain was worth it. Super strange, it\u2019s quite an alien looking place. We took the 45 min trail which was lovely. We asked our taxi driver to come back for us (which he did happily).",
          "In La Paz, we got to Valley of the Moon by Teleferico and taxi. We really loved travelling by Teleferico, and it is so reasonably priced. You get great views and transport all in one. We took the Yellow Line and then the Green Line to get in the general area, and then took a",
          "One can see why this landscape was perfect for filming some of Starwars. It is haunting, errie and spectacularly beautiful. There are well marked trails for hiking. Take sunscreen, a hat, walking sticks and water. We spent about an hour, but could have easily remained for",
          "We visited Valley of the Moon with a tour guide who walked us around the park for around an hour telling us about the history. It was interesting and a great landscape. There are some people trying to sell things/busk so take coins if you want to partake in those things.",
          "The landscape was incredible. It was made more amazing by the fact that it was a relatively short and cheap cab ride from the La Paz city center. We were told that per Neil Armstrong, this landscape is one that most closely resembles that of the moon on Earth.",
          "Getting to the Valle de la Luna was difficult, is it just a matter of waiting so be prepared to wait in the sun. It's just how it is though. Once you're there is it really cool. Can get the bus (43, 902 or 273) for 3BOB each and entrance to the Valle del la Luna is 15BOB.",
          "Our visit to Valle de la Luna is a very memorable one. The views are spectacular. Be sure to bring your camera, and have enough time to do the longest of the two routes (I think that one was estimated to about 45 minutes). We had an arrangement with a taxi driver to wait for us,",
          "Almost alien like sand formations due to natural erosion. Walk around for some good pictures and exercise.",
          "We caught a Combi headed for Mallasa and asked to get off at Valle de la Luna - followed the 1 hour trail which gave great views!",
          "Do not miss visiting this place and go with enough time to walk around and enjoy the incredible formation an views. You have a short an a long curcuit with time you can do the long one. Wow what a place looks like you are in another planet",
          "We went there with a taxi from the La Paz city center. It was a bright sunny day and the rock formations were showing in a wonderful light (great for pictures). The walk through the Moon Valley takes about 45 min to 1 hour, depending on how much time you take. It wasn't very",
          "This is a strange and fascinating place to explore. When we got tired we could just scan the view from a high spot.",
          "This place is absolutely incredible for a 2-3hour visit. It has two walking paths (one for 15min and the other for 45min). We took the longer one and got to take great pictures along the way. It looks out of this world and the trail is well defined for easy hiking. Best way to",
          "This is an amazing geological formation and is extensive. We were able to see a large section of these amazing fairy chimneys, which are the result of massive erosion of sedimentary deposits. Some larger boulders have protected the tops of these features to create spires. Paths",
          "It's just a short distance from La Paz. You can take bus number 43 from Plaza San Francisco (very center of the city). It's not that often, so you'll maybe need to wait a while or if you can find direct micro even better. Bus will drive you around 45 minutes, micro maybe a",
          "Nice place but wasn\u2019t anything special. If you have a day spare you can visit it as it\u2019s a 400 bolivianos taxi from the center but I wouldn\u2019t prioritize it.",
          "Pros: 15b entrance 2.5b bus available from main square Interesting to see and good way to pass half the day Cons: All buses are full for the return journey, 40s taxi needed Set next to normal housing neighbourhood so loses its natural charm due to surroundings",
          "Loved my 50 minute trek here. There is an entrance fee of 15b. The view was really nice, and the place was really properly planned. The hike was easy due to the good condition of the roads. It was an easy hike even if u take the 45 mins hike vs 15min one. Would recommend here if",
          "This is an awesome spot, just a cab ride from our La Paz hotel. The driver even agreed to come back and pick us up, and he was thoughtful enough to arrive early when he saw it was starting to rain. A fascinating place. Not of this Earth lol.",
          "Unreal place sole 12km away from la paz CBD. You can go with a collectivo (3bob) or via a taxi (6bob). The entrance is 15BOB... nice location.",
          "We did a tour on a quad bike there and I did not liked it. I was concentrating on the driving (most of the time in streets with other cars) and not on the view. We stoped twice on the way to look at the view but it wasn't enough for me.",
          "A nice well maintained picturesque park in La Paz. From zona central, you just need to take a minibus heading to Mallasa (around 30min) to arrive there.",
          "Really enjoyed this location and being able to wander around amongst all the different shapes set very close to each other. There are 2 walks, one about 15 mins and the other 45 mins to 1 hour. Make sure you visit some of the artisan shops near the entrance.",
          "If you are interested in natural landscape, then Valle de la Luna is a wonderful place for a short(2 hours to half day) excursion from the city. It is easy to get there and tour around on your own. My friend and I went there by taking a mini-bus (going to Mallassa, 4 BOB, 30",
          "Took us about an hour to go there from the Sopocachi area (where in the Ave. Arce there are colectivos that would past exactly at this place). And about the an hour walking around this place. My opinion is that it's a good stroll especially with a group of hostelmates but",
          "This place is 5 miles out of the way, but if you have an hour to waste from Central Lina, the traffic you know, and 5 minutes to take photographs of a Flintstone/Star Wars landscape this is the place for you",
          "The landscape is very interesting and has an eary feel to it, that is how strange it is. It is basically in the city and a short excursion so do visit it when you are in La Paz.",
          "We took a micro bus from La Paz which was easy and cheap. It was a great drive as it gave us a chance to see other parts of the city. The valley itself is really cool and has awesome rock formations. If you have time to kill, this is worth a trip.",
          "We went by the city bus. We had a stop at the valley for ca. 30 min. For us it was enough time to enjoy the amazing view over the valley. With more time you could go different ways through the valley.",
          "You need to go visit Valley of the Moon when visiting La Paz- the landscape looks just like you were walking o on the Moon. Because the mineral content of the mountains varies greatly, between individual mountains, the sides of the mountains are different colors, creating",
          "We were staying in Mallasa when we went here, and despite mixed reviews about it, I really enjoyed it. They had just had a Star Wars event, so there were star wars ships all over - which made it even cooler :) It took about an hour to get through the trail we chose, and the",
          "An OK place to visit. The site is not well policed with many people walking off the designated paths and destroying the surrounding features. There's some good photo opportunities of the landscape.",
          "We visited on quad bike and the valley does have some impressive rock formations. But it\u2019s not a must see. If you\u2019ve travelled elsewhere in Bolivia there are far more impressive and cost efficient attractions in the south.",
          "Moon Valley was just two miles from our hotel. It is a highly dissected area of a muddy siltstone conglomerate. It simply couldn't be built on so it has been set aside and now has a gift shop that might be open or not, restrooms, and trails. It's really stunning to walk through",
          "This place is more than amazing!!!!! There wasn\u2019t a lot of people visiting it which made it more fun and i was able to take as many picture as I wanted. Loved it !!! Make sure to visit this place!! Its very cheap to enter but also very cheap to get there from the city.",
          "Bit like wandering around an \"open cut cave\" with a range of \"stalagmite\" type structures. Haven't seen anything like this before.",
          "I visited with a local friend and I really enjoy it .It has nice views of the city from the southern part of La paz.You don't need to take or arrange a tour to visit it you can go there by your own by public transportation which is very cheap.",
          "Only 40minutes outside of La Paz so well worth a visit. You can do the walk quickly, 20 mins, or stroll for about an hour on the longer route. If you keep your eyes open you may be lucky enough to see some wildlife inc. Vizcachas (like large rabbits). The formations are clay",
          "This was a great day trip as we had limited time in Atacama! The guide was excellent and so informative. Highly recommend this tour.",
          "I read a review that explained the public bus route but really glad I shared a cab as the journey was 45 minutes away from our hotel (10km). The cab cost 100 Bolivianos for a return journey. Entry fee is 15 Bolivianos so approximately \u00a31.50 GBP. There was a 15 or 45 minute",
          "Reminds me of Bryce Canyon in Utah but with grey and black colored rock formations. Nice view from the top. Little dangerous as people can push you off the cliff.",
          "Quite a difference to be there - generally as to be on the moon. It is a short travel away fro La Paz. Could be made by taxi or public cab. Significant site for la Paz, as it hasn't lot to offer.",
          "This spot is just 30/45 minutes outside of La Paz. Super easy to get to, just take a collective going in the direction of Mallasa, cost 2.60 bolivianos. The collectivo will drop you off right at the entrance. The entrance is 15 bolivianos and takes about 1 hour if you walk",
          "I had a great time visiting this amazing rock formation. It was a bit difficult to get there but it was worthy. I hadn\u00b4t seen anything similar before. I recommend it",
          "Cool place to visit! Is basically a desert with lots crates and lots of hiking paths....we went late in the afternoon and the weather was a bit cool.",
          "I know you can get here by yourself on public transport, but I did an organised tour. The cost was quite small and it was much easier being in a \"van\" than trying to figure it out for yourself. The landscape is incredible. The 40 min path was quite easy to navigate despite the",
          "We spent about 20minutes at Moon Valley. The clay and basalt structures are interesting and, in some cases amazing. You can do walks of different lengths at the site. A good thing to do on a trip around La Paz.",
          "We did the 45mn tour (you can do the 15mn if you\u2018re short in time). This \u201evalley\u201c, which was the bottom of the ocean, shows you how beautiful is Nature. The 45mn gives you enough time to enjoy and find peace of mind, and doesn\u2018t feel \u201etoo long\u201c. Take water, not much shadow, and",
          "Valley of the Moon can easily be done in half a day (even on the longer route) and has some interesting and nice scenery. We went without a guide and don't think you would necessarily need one. You can get a local bus from in front of San Francisco church (choose one that says",
          "The landscape is beautiful and the location very serene. At about 1pm a piper stood on one of the pinaccles and played lovely music for a few minutes. The paths are clearly marked and the 45 minute route took me exactly 45 minutes and was only one kilometer. If you sit and",
          "What a wonderful place! I felt like I was on the moon. I was surrounded by sandstone which gave that other worldly feeling. I recommend taking a leisure walk around the Valley of the moon.",
          "We visited the valley because it was part of the chacaltaya tour. It was a special scenery to see , but small and surrounded by city/buildings. Wouldnt recommend if you do not have that much time.",
          "Valley of the Moon is like walking into another planet. The landscape is surreal and alien like. It is a must see to believe it. You can spend an easy hour or two walking around admiring all the different formations. Follow my #30somethinggapyear on Instagram",
          "Pros: This place is beautiful, unique and very inexpensive. You can talk a long walk (45 min) or a short walk (15 min) - both are self guided. I loved the little look outs and view points along the way. You might also meet a flute player who is sweet and charming and will try",
          "Oftentimes, this is combined with the Chacaltaya climb. Does not really make any sense, as one is north of the city and the valley south of it. The drive through the city takes a good 2-3 hours. The valley itself is does provide some nice sandstone formations, but the site is",
          "A beautiful landscape with weird shapes of rocks. Definitely a nice day trip you can do on your own.",
          "Really wonderful to check this out and capture amazing pictures!! A good excursion from an otherwise dreary La Paz!! Also, take a local bus all the way for 2Bs!!",
          "Don't miss the Valley of the Moon if you are in La Paz, especially if you haven't been to Bryce Canyon in Utah (the only place I have seen which is comparable). It is a fairly unique place in a unique and under appreciated city.",
          "I was born and raised in la paz but every time I come here I love it more, this time I came with a foreign tourist and some friends, we had a great time and the rock formations are out of this world Neil Armstrong named it weeell",
          "If you love geology, you will enjoy the features of this moonscape/badlands that is a short ride out of town. Just wish I had more time here but was on a tour and only got to spend maybe 30 minutes here.",
          "This place is really unique,the formations are breathtaking in a serene setting, full of wonder and natural beauty!",
          "Fascinating geological feature, nice walk through a unique natural feature. It\u2019s easily accessible from the downtown. Don\u2019t miss Mario Sarabia\u2019s pottery studio nearby. He uses the raw material from the Valley to create his art.",
          "The Moon Valley in La Paz is very close to the city of La Paz, about 20 min. by car going south of the city direction to Mallasa. This is a geological formation by erosion due to wind, rain and time. We got there by minibus one from the central part to Obrajes plaza Humboldt",
          "short and great walk through this Canyon. It reminded me on Bryce Canyon in the States. the sand is beige and not red though!",
          "There's many way and you can lost your self just waking and will have lots of things to think \ud83e\udd14, really appreciate that place, many way to get there, public transportation , taxi \ud83d\ude95, definitely you can do it yourself, you will spend less that half day,hours, don't miss it!",
          "The valley of the moon is a geological oddity created by erosion. Composed of clay and sandstone which the elements have whittled down to spires and ravines with other minerals adding colors of tan, red, and voilet. The site offers trails of two lengths which are 15 and 45",
          "Its a bunch of eroded hills with a subterranean entrance that did not do a thing for me. It is sort on unusual but the steps are poorly maintained and it just sort of weird.",
          "Our hotel messed up one of our tours so arranged for a guide to take us around La Paz. She was indigenous and when she took us here she was able to give us an amazing understanding of the indigenous history along with the current political landscape.",
          "This is another do not miss half day adventure in LaPaz. Beautiful views, lovely mountains scapes. This is about 14,000 feet above sea level, if you are not aclimitized to the altitude do not take the walking tours. Rent the All terrain vehicles.....more fun and a guide will",
          "There are Colectivo's that will take you right from San FranciscoPlaza to the site, it is worth going, very strange rock/dirt formations. Colectivo's can take you back to the city and you can get off close to the start of the cable car line and take it to eL Alto.",
          "If you like moon views and walking, this is the place to visit! Go with clothes and confy shoes! a great hat is a must do! You can walk the entire place in 1-2 hours! Better go on a sunny day! Take some pics, you will think you are on the moon! Visits are during the day!",
          "Some guidebooks are definitely unkind about the Valley of the Moon. It\u2019s certainly an otherworldly rock formation that is unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen before. From the road it doesn\u2019t look like much but the main walk with photo stops can take around 50 minutes if you don\u2019t",
          "Interesting natural phenomenon. Lots of crevasses, caves and rocks to climb with stunning panoramic views at the top, overlooking the valley. There are also sand dunes here, would recommend wearing good walking shoes (not flip-flops/sandals). We picked a tour later on in the",
          "Given the location it is surprising to find this kind of scenario - Lunar scenery near the city. It's interesting.",
          "I'm always surprised by the power of nature and its artistic power. Amazing place, allow yourself at least one hour to enjoy it fully. Don't forget your cameras!!!",
          "The landscape was so unique and beautiful. The walk itself in the valley was very short (around 40 minutes). Would definitely recommend as a day trip from La Paz.",
          "Made of clay this park erodes each rainy season and according to our guide will one day disapear. Made of clay it has mounds from the ground that replicate the appearance of the moon. At 3000m it is much lower than La Paz anx also warmer.",

          "Not sure of the entry price, as included in a morning tour. Strange geological site in the suburbs of La Paz. Spectacular....no. Definitely worth a visit if included in a tour. Would not make a specific effort to go and see it. Come from a country with very similar landscapes,",
          "- a little bit far from the city - interesting place - good organization for the trail - very beautiful, unseen",
          "Really interesting shapes in the rocks nd beautiful scenery. It's smaller than I thought - I spent about an hour there and took lots of photos. You can get a collectivo there from the corner of plaza San Francisco and Sagarnaga heading to Mallasa for dirt cheap (45 minutes) and",
          "We caught a collectivo from Plaza San Francisco which took us right to the entrance. This is a fascinating place if you enjoy seeing unusual natural environments. A choice of a short 15 minute walk or a longer 45 minute one.",
          "If you come to La Paz you should see Moon Valley, you don't need to much time to visit I believe. Also our day trip stoped for a 30-40 min only and that was enough.",
          "It is as it says like walking on the moon, it is well set out And takes about 45 min to walk. Not suitable for disabled. We really enjoyed this different scenery!!!",
          "Feel like you are in another world! Just catch one of the mini vans there and back to la paz approximately 45mins. Can't remember the destination name but did find it on trip advisor",
          "Awesome scenery for great pictures. Located in one of the 7 Wonder Cities in the World, you feel like you're out un space. Enjoy the fresh air and the blue Sky. Excellent for Scholl field trips or family outings!",
          "So unique, not far from the city (in part by Teleferico), definitely worth it! There are 2 walks - we did the longer one, took maybe an hour cause we dawdled, took lots of pics.",
          "Our wonderful tour guides -Alex of Late Bolivia- took us here We Had a lovely hike (easy hour when you stop for photos! )",
          "Great experience- there is a small admission fee. I've never seen anything like this- you need to check it out. The mountains in the background make the pictures amazing.",
          "Took a cab out to moon valley, the place itself if alright but very touristy. It's worth seeing if your in la Paz",
          "Enjoyed an hour here walking around and enjoying the scenery, the first thing thzt grabbed me was the quiet after a few days of the traffic and hustle and bustle of La Paz it was actually a welcome relief. Easy to get to by bus.",
          "fantastic place, very easy to get here by taxi (and very cheap); we spent there more then 2 hours to investigate all places and make photos; it's better to visit in the morning otherwise the sun would burn you; take sunblock cream with you and water.",
          "This is a site that you would expect to see in the US Southwest. Yet here it is in the city of La Paz. There is a choice of trails through the area. They are well laid out. Very impressive. We loved it.",
          "Amazing place to see the effect of erosion over tens of thousands of years, the shapes in the clay will leave u fascinated. Recommended to everyone visiting La Paz, and easy to get there with the public transport.",
          "This was a real find in the middle of a big sprawling busy city. Unique landscape and great city views make for a great place to go visit. Was also great to see this part of the city that is away from the bustling center.",
          "This is an easy 2 hour excursion from La Paz. No need for a tour, can get there easily by taxi (and likely bus from Zona Sur). Two trails, one 45 minutes one 15. Worth a visit. to see the cool rock formations. Not at all wilderness though, it\u00b4s surrounded by population",
          "You can't miss it! Being in La Paz and not going to the Valley of the Moon is like going to a Pizza restaurant and not eat pizza. It's a close ride from the city and will not take you more than 2 hours to walk around and enjoy this extra terrestrial scenery.",
          "The valley of the moon has dirt rock formations that are appropriate to it's name. After walking in just a few feet in the trails you lose sight of civilization and without trails would get easily lost as walking around where the riverbeds would be with towering rock dirt",
          "I spent about an hour here and covered the longer trail. There is a number of view points to take some good photographs, however, unless you are a geology geek you may find that walking through the landscape becomes somewhat tedious? If you have only a day in La Paz, I would",
          "We did an independent trip by public transport here and it was smooth and safe. The site itself offer all the facilities that one may need, but the surroundings lack on bars/restaurants so bring your food/drinks.",
          "The Valley of the Moon is a quick drive away from downtown La Paz. It is perfectly unique and enchanting enclave imbedded in the middle of the Andes mountains. the entire area has been fitted with narrow foot pats and makeshift bridges, which allow for a pleasant and fun filled",
          "We took the hop bus, the sound doesn't work in most off all seats. They stop by for 15 minutes, more than enough to take some pictures. I wasn't impressed at all.",
          "Super for a day trip from La Paz. There's a really easy path to stroll around the park. Suitable for most ages. Very affordable and easy to get to. Worth a visit.",
          "This place is amazing, worth a visit to get some cool pictures. It's around half an hour drive from centre of La paz. There is a lovely camping village about 2 miles from it, if you want to stay in the area overnight.",
          "The valley is an interesting set of various mud sculptures made by the rain and the wind. There are trails that one can follow to see some of the most interesting shapes. Nothing extraordinary in my opinion.",
          "This place is not worth your time or money getting to. It's surrounded by city and feels like a child's amusement park. Go see valle de la animas for much more impressive formations and it's free (at least for now).",
          "The landform here is amazing, a variety of features in different shapes and special plants. It is easy to walk around with quite a lot of lookout points. Nice nature in the city centre.",
          "The site offers 15 minutes and 45 minutes hike. Of course, there is no limit on time you can spend there. There are nice viewpoints convenient for taking pictures. There is a store where you can buy nicely designed souvenir t-shirts cheaper than in La Paz market. I was not",
          "Very different landscape and conveniently located right in La Paz make it a worthwhile visit. Less than 1 hour is required to walk around the site.",
          "this was part of our tour in La Paz and it\u2019s well worth visiting if you\u2019re in town. Bearing a striking resemblance to the Badlands in South Dakota, this place was undoubtedly created by the same geological forces. While smaller than its US counterpart it is a little better in",
          "When you see this place you will know why it is called Valle de la Lun a. A little far out of the city but easy access on the local buses. A nice place to spend about an hour.Great for the slightly older kids.( 8 and above)",
          "Sure it is original but first, the place smells like a poney stable and second, it's not special enough to go all the way to this place",
          "Visited in early July 2017 as part of a La Paz city tour solely for me. It is just a short drive from the city and is worthwhile but wear suitable shoes, and you need a head for heights. Ideal for photographers as the sun is going down to capture those shadowy visions.",
          "This is a relatively unique place as it resembles some kind of Star Wars film set and it is in La Paz city just South of the city centre.about one hour and a half to explore and overall it is one of the top things to do in my opinion if you are in La Paz",
          "You do not see this just any where, so do NOT miss it. A quick ride from the city by taxi. Paths are marked. Easy climb. Glad they made it a small park.",
          "Interesting landscape. Be sure to find out when it was discovered, and how....then let your climate change opponant friends know! Also find out about the connection to Neil Armstrong. I agree with Gary M, it's not safe for young children, also the elderly, or those not 100%",
          "Valle de la Luna/Moon Valley was smaller than we expected & now being built up and around so seems to have lost some of the raw beauty it must have had. Very busy on a Sunday with families visiting - between noisy families & the nearby gun range?/perhaps they were clearing on",
          "Was nice to walk around and see took many photos. Lots of up and downs and a bit slippery in places. Hard for elderly persons to navigate. Still it was an interesting visit.",
          "This attraction has some interesting geological features (severe erosion in the soft rock), and is a pleasant walk around, if only to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. Entry is quite reasonable, and you are left to wander the site by yourself. I would warn travelers",
          "Valle de la Luna is surprisingly close to the city center of La Paz. It's an OK place to go if you have 2 to 3 hours of extra time. This is nowhere close to a 'must see' in La Paz, but then again, La Paz is not a place with any 'must see' attractions. I enjoyed my stay in La",
          "An incredible site right in La Paz! reminiscing of Bryce Canyon - in a much more smaller scale - right in La Paz. Interesting.",
          "It's a nice 40minute hike. No need to book a tour. A minibus from Iglesias San Francisco will take you in front of the entrance and back.",

          "Valle de la Luna is about 30 minutes\u2019 drive from the centre of La Paz. It\u2019s apparently pretty easy to get here by bus, though for 100 Bolivianos (\u00a312) we paid a taxi driver with a nice modern car to calmly drive us there, wait for 2 hours and then drive us back. The attraction",
          "Your view on the place will be dictated by previous experiences. It is no Bryce Canyon or Kunming Stone Forest, but if you haven't seen them it is an interesting place to spend an hour. It is a relaxing place to walk - the paths are generally good - or just sit and soak up the",
          "You can see similar dirt formations on the way to getting there. They are everywhere. If the called the place \"Eroded soil\", no-one would bother visiting, I'm sure.",
          "I highly recommend you go and see Valle de la Luna. We were originally going to bike it on our own but when we went with a tour group we realised we would have missed a lot of the cool sites and we would have been exhausted doing from biking in a higher altitude from what we are",
          "nice and easy hike so that altitude doesn't affect you too much. Views are amazing and the price is ok.",
          "I was visiting La Paz and this site is only 1 hour away by cab. I believe you can go by public transportation or Trufi as well, but since it was our first day and only 100 boliviani for the round trip, we jumped in the cab. The driver waited for us at the parking lot. I felt",
          "A decent stop if you have a little bit longer in La Paz. Very easy to get to by local buses and cheap. If you see a guy playing on the windpipes and, like me, it makes you feel you are in the middle of a Western (in a good way) don't forget to tip him like I did. He leaves his",
          "I travelled to the Valle de la Luna as part of a small tour group. It is an amazing place situated about 30 min drive out of the heart of La Paz. You are treated to interested formations, with surreal views. There are many routes that can be taken around the venue so I would",
          "30 minutes out of town, small but nice walk. Take care because it was hard to find transport back to town",

          "Valle de la Luna is a beautiful nature park located a short drive from downtown La Paz. It is comprised of various paths weaving through a truly unique landscape of natural spires of soil and stone spires. The only thing like it in the world that I've seen in Bryce Canyon in the",
          "Nice views and great trekkings, it is a very nice and cheap trip to do in La Paz and you won\u00b4t regret being there. Very recommended for a 3 hour trip and you don't expend more than a 100 pesos Bolivianos including entrance and taxi rides.",
          "There are so many other places more beautiful than this in Bolivia! If you are only in La Paz for a short period of time and will not go anywhere else in Bolivia, then do it.",
          "Valle de la Luna is a maze of canyons and giant spires. The formations, composed mainly of clay and sandstone, were created by the persistent erosion of mountains by the area\u2019s strong winds and rains. What remains is a surrealistic setting, full of wonder.There are two circular",
          "There is something with the moon valley that gives me a lot of peace. There are apparently two paths, a 15 minutes one and another of around, 45 minutes but I enjoyed the former and took almost 2 hours. The ticket was 15 pesos and it is easy to arrive there, but it would be best",
          "In the south part of La Paz City, this landscape is an interesting site to discover very nice views. The silence and the sightseeing makes it worth visiting.",
          "Very interesting landscape just outside of la Paz. About a 40 minute taxi ride for around 60 Bs. Or you can bus and cabke car. Cool to see if you have a couple hours to kill! Makes for great pictures.",
          "Relatively close to La Paz, this was a very cool stop. Take your time look at this interesting geographical landscape and just drink in the contrasts of the red mountains around. Do it!",
          "We visited the Moon Valley after lunch on day 2 in La Paz. It is very interesting to see the different shapes that the erosion has left behind but access is limited because movement about the area will cause even greater erosion. There are some nice views from the high points",
          "Easy to get to and worth the visit. Spires and domes of odd colored clay that overlooks the red and brown mountains make for an great landscape. You can walk through the place in about 15 minutes and they have put some steps in so its easy to get up and down. The colors are",
          "The place is very interesting. I took a local bus from La Paz Centro and it took me about 40 mins. You should leave after the rush hour! There should be 273 bus but I could not find the bus number so I took 271 instead from Mexico street. This place is all so interesting!",
          "Although the area is quite large the track does not take long to walk. It is interesting to see the erosion that has taken place and see how they were reclaiming the area, although that has now stopped. You can also look back and get a good view of the city f La Paz from here",
          "This city will disappear if they don't plant some trees, my city is green all year around and here everything is brown with a few trees. This place shows what is going to happen in the future with this place. I got choked !!",
          "Enjoyed our short visit here. It does not takes long to walk the tracks as it doesnt cover a very big area. Was very interesting though and worth seeing",
          "This \"park\" has two trails through the rock formations, a 15min and a 45min one. If you're driving all the way here, I suggest the 45min trail, though it can be easily done in 30min. The trail, however, is falling apart in places because of the rain (making the path almost too",
          "Moon valley is a small exhibition for interesting natural rock sculptures. It is only 15 BOB to enter and 2.50 BOB each way on the bus to get there, or you can take the teleferico and then a bus - a more enjoyable way!",
          "It's a bunch of erosion effected mud that sort of looks like moonscape. Only problem is you are still surrounded by urban sprawl, so its a bit hard to indulge in the fantasy. It's really hard to breathe due to La Paz's altitude, so thats kind of like the moon. It only costs $7",
          "A very unique location that is not commonly found. We had great photos here. Suggest to spend more than 1 hour to walk to various part/paths.",
          "Valle de la Luna is gorgeous, well thought out and sympathetic walking path - don't come here thinking it's a hike - with a lovely meandering path through the area. The journey up very pretty as well. We just did this all super cheap on public transport Colectivo there - get",
          "Eventhough colour range of the landscapes is contrary to local fabrics, scarce and limited by sandy to grey, with scattered green of cactus and equisetum, the whole scenery gives you very intense aesthetic pleasure to behold. It is certainly worth of a taxi trip, a few miles",
          "It doesn't take a long time to see everything so it is quite a long way out of town for a short experience. It is however very interesting and beautiful and worth the trip. You should be careful when you walk around. There isn't the same level of health and safety as in the UK.",
          "We visited this unique place for an hour or so. The erosion of the land creates an interesting view worth the walk. We did the 45 min circle and enjoyed it very much. It was not crowded but there were others on the trail. This would be difficult for those with mobility issues",
          "Beautiful place, worth to visit. U need only couple of hours. Take a van from plaza san Francisco that goes to mallasa. (Small city right after moon valley). It costs around 4bs one way. Tell the driver u are going to valley de la luna, he will stop there. Entrance is about 15bs",
          "We took the minibus \"collectivo\" from plaza San Francisco to Mallasa (small village right next to the valley of the moon) for around 4 bolivianos each one way and we asked the driver to drop us off at the moon valley and he stopped right in front of the entrance. The entrance",
          "Interesting is the word I would use to describe this site. I'm still not sure what it was? There was no information in Spanish or English but it was great to see so unusual especially in the city. I will have to look up some information later. We paid a taxi 150bs to take us",
          "There are lots of beautiful geological formations around La Paz but this is one of the easiest to access and it is full of crazy shapes so I'd definitely recommend a visit. We spent around 1 hour at a pretty slow pace so we could enjoy the landscape, but if you don't have much",
          "I would not recommend you to go there. I did not find anything special to see or do there. I went there because the price was the same if we went there or not. You can buy it as a package together with the trip to Chacaltaya. But a green park that was close to this attraction",
          "Cool scenery, not a long activity but great to wander and take photos for an hour. Just manage expectations! Easy and in our experience perfectly safe to get there without a tour, 4B each way on the yellow micro collectivo/bus that comes down the Main Street to San Francisco",
          "Good for one time visit. I took a tour. It is very different experience. It will take 1-2 hr max. Enjoy it.",
          "One of the things that made this trip special is that was an native guy playing the charango over a mountain in the Moon Valley. The walking with the music on the background make a difference. We went on the 15 minute track and we finish it in 7 minutes, so if you got time get",
          "This was ok for an extra of a different tour I was doing. I personally wouldn't bother wasting my time by visiting alone or paying for a tour just do visit",
          "A nice place to go if you are visiting La Paz, at some point you really feel like in another planet. It's a short visit, so it won't take more than half of your day.",
          "It's a nice to see place and the walking path is well maintained. I went with the bus tour from La Paz and they officially only give you 20 minutes to see the Valley. At the end we stayed nearly 45 minutes but that didn't help for people who were back on time. So if you go",
          "Located outside the city it might not be worth the effort to get there. The formations are pretty cool but it's only a 45 minute walking loop. If you do go, take the local bus (vans) to get there. Mallasa or Jupapina.",
          "It's a nice place to see something different and un common, it doesn't take too much time, it's just 45min to see everything.",
          "We went as part of a city tour. Interesting landscape. Toilets, described on the sign as hygienic, had no water to refill the bowl or to wash your hands (son had diarrhea)",
          "On December 31, 2016, I visited Moon Valley, and then did quad biking around the area. It was worth the entrance fee, and the quad biking also was worth it. My tour guide was a great photographer too, which added to the enjoyable experience.",
          "A nice day trip if you are staying nearby in Jupapina like we were. But if you are coming from La Paz then I don't think it's totally worth it. The bus journey from La Paz provides just as good views.",
          "Check it out if you are in La Paz. Definitely worth a visit. We did this as a part of a trip to Chacaltaya, but you can also get here by bus from La Paz.",
          "We went by the sightseeing bus so we only had a 15 minute stop. For us, it was enough. It tend to be very hot in la Valle de la Luna on a sunny day.",
          "This is a themepark version of a natural formation and much smaller than you would assume. Not worth the time, effort or money of getting there from La Paz. Spend your time and money elsewhere.",
          "Small but pretty geological site, nice for a half hour's walk. Beautiful rock formations, beware though as some of the ground is unstable. There is nowhere to buy water here so bring your own.",
          "This place is absolutely amazing. It looks like the pictures of the moon itself. Although some days is a little bit packed because it's very touristic, it is a must go if you visit la Paz. Great places to take good pictures. Go with comfortable shoes and be ready to take of and",
          "It is a fair way out of town , we got there by the cable car then a taxi at the end station . Strange landscape that lives up to its name , lots of photo opps",
          "It's ok. If you ahve time to spare. Sure. You can walk around in 15-30 minutes. The formations are cool but not magnificent.",
          "Unless this is already part of your tour- not really worth a special trip to see. Small area of \"Badlands\" type of rock formations , which you can walk around in about half an hour.",
          "Definately worth visiting! Beautiful and peaceful place. Views are amazing. Don't forget the hat because sun is very strong there.",
          "A great place to have the moon-feeling of the Andes! We loved walking through the area or to stop and sit and be silent. It is in the south of la Paz and you can spend between half an hour or 3h .... If you have some extra time in La Paz: go and enjoy!",
          "I took a combi for 2.6 bs. to get there. The entrance fee is 15 bs. You do not need a tour guy. There are 2 options when you get in: a 15 minutes hike or a 45 minutes. I did the longest, I loved it!! Very easy to hike...Nobody was there so it was very peaceful, the view is soo",
          "I really enjoyed the visit here. the views were amazing and the valley was great to walk around it passed a lovely hour and is well worth the visit.",
          "Surrealistic landscaping.I agree with Mr.Armstong to describe it as a Lunar valley.Well connected with bus. To be honest I was expecting something larger and a bit more loooked after. But was a great experience.",
          "easy to get too. Really cool way to spend an hour climbing around on weird rocks and looking a cool rodents and plant life.",
          "This is for you if you like rocks. This park is a main attraction for tourists. It displays how the weather and elements have formed this valley of all kinds of structures. The formations look like ones you would find in humid caves.",
          "If you are in La Paz a few days it's fine to go a couple of hours. Moon landscape, nice walk, nothing special.",
          "It is just stunning. Beautiful stone jungle with amazing view of the whole city. It is a bit hard with the transportation. We had a hard time finding the taxi back to the city center. Not even expecting any buses or so. But the place is definitely worth visiting.",
          "I note that most reviewers use the term \"interesting\", which indicates \"waste of time\". It is indeed a dry lunar landscape, surrounded by the city's housing. Visit 10 minutes if you must.",
          "This is a great place to visit. The clay formations are incredible - even a little eerie. It is well marked out with paths and steps on gentle slopes which makes it easier for those feeling the altitude. Very different from most tourist destinations. I loved it",
          "Valle de la Luna is a nice place to visit when you have 2 or 3 days in La Paz. You can visit the site in 3 different ways: the first one is a tour that also includes 'Chacaltaya' (a ski resort at 5300m), by taxi or by (mini)bus. We chose the latter of the 3 options. From the big",
          "Did a tour when Diana tours. The information given be guide was very basic but the views speak for themselves. Beautiful!",
          "Either a 15 minute or 45 minute walk through a lunar landscape inhabited by rabbits. Very little vegetation just cacti. A peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of La Paz. Our guide could not explain how the landscape was formed but it was unique.",
          "Heard about this place has always thought big and wild place. The place is located almost in the city center, a small place with lots of tourists. If there is something more important to do, can be dispensed with.",
          "This is a natural formation and a very unusual and unique one situated in the south lower end of La Paz in a residential area Yes, the formations are impressive but most of The Valley was encroached by and used for high end housing , so the view is really limited I cannot give",
          "Very different topography to the rest of La Paz hence the name. If you are in the area then it's worth a visit - there are a couple of paths that lead you around up and down. The path is quite steep and narrow in places.",
          "Too far , not good, after salar of uyuni, this place is boring taxi is a way to go and to return the bus takes you to city center",
          "Valle de la Luna is like you are on the moon, due to the dirt formations: makes it for a nice and unique day trip, by minibus.",
          "It was a nice ride, but not so impressive. It is not mandatory to do it with a guide! You can just take a bus and do it yourself.",
          "It's not a legend: the first man on the moon name this place \"Valle de la Luna\" whilst he was playing at the golf court nearby. Well worthy a visit :-)",
          "nice sight but much smaller than you would expect, encompassed in urban developments this is something to do if you have lots of free time.",
          "This is close to the city to organise a visit with a taxi. The place is totally surreal with beautiful views. No need for a guide it's all well laid out footpaths around the site. We took the 45 minute walk and enjoyed it. Wanted to stay longer but we asked the taxi to wait for",
          "We went there as part of a tour and really enjoyed the 45 minutes walk in Valle de la Luna and the view of Devils Tooth. Entrance is 15 Bs for adults and 1 Bs for children. It is important to keep your kids under close supervision when visiting this place as there is plenty",
          "Valle de la Luna, aka Moon Valley, is an area where erosion has worn away the majority of a mountain in La Paz. At an altitude of 3299 MASL, the site is composed primarily of clay rather than rock, and tall spires are left making you think you truly are out of this world. A cool",
          "Neil Armstrong visited this place and said it looks like Moon Surface and hence this Valle de la Luna became tourist famous. Its Ok for one visit. You need to walk a lot with lot of stairs going up and down hence elderly people think before you buy a ticket to move around. Carry",
          "Its a fascinating walk in surrealistic scenery of rock formations and on clearly marked paths. No problem to do this on your own. We took a taxi from Lap Paz center - cost us 40 Bs. They placed a musician in local attire on the highest peak playing lovely flute music and it",
          "Good tour. Fries had good stops extra time at sunset. Left just as it got good though. Would recommend to others for the info. He was funny.",
          "What a place. Do the 45 minute walk around. It is worth taking time to explore the hidden treasures of this place; the many cactus varieties, pebbles precariously mixed within the 'dirt', the shy creatures that pop their heads out and the drop-offs that make you watch where you",
          "Interesting rock formations through out the park. Nice for a half day activity with family, friends or solo. At the entrance of the park there's some shops where you can find artwork by local artists. Worth visiting!",
          "Nice place to reach for an afternoon. Not expensive and easy to walk. Our tour did combine Moon Valley with Chacaltaya mountain that we did not expect to do but which was finally more impresive ! We take the tour from Loki Hostel : the guide was basic ... Minibus okay.",
          "We got a taxi to here and back to town meaning all in we ended up spending 150Bs (included the 15Bs admission for 2 people) in Canadian that works out to around $40. Definitely worth it. Landscape was awesome and in the afternoon you avoid it being such a touristy trap and you",
          "I was skeptical. I wasn't going to visit but decided to anyways. I'm so glad I did. Valle de la luna offered amazing views, and some \"unearth\" like geography! The landscape is surely one of a kind.",
          "It's 40 mins from La Paz, about 40-50 B$ taxi one way. Costs 15 B$ to get in. It's a marvel to wander around and take some cool shots of rocky landscapes. Do the 45 min route, you will see a lot more than the typical touristy 15 min route. Worth the trip for sure!",
          "Its a very different but interesting place! We went there for an hour and without sunglasses and sun hat it was a little bit to sunny to really enjoy full!",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to Valle De La Luna.. There are a lot of places to explore. I would suggest bringing water, sunblock and wearing comfortable shoes to explore the area. Plan on spending, at least 4 hours. You can choose to hike up some stairs and walk the perimeter.",
          "Very close to the city and easily accessible by any collectivo bus going to Mallasa, this place offers superb views and nice chance to escape from the city chaos. Entrance fee is 15 Bs for international travellers (no student discounts). Well-maintained park with 15 or 45 min",
          "We visited the moon valley as second part of our day tour. The moon valley was much easier to walk around in and amazing geographically. The walk took around an hour is should be done out of the days hot sun. Worth a visit!",
          "I was in La paz late last month into the early part of this month and did a few tours. After going to Chacalyta I vistited this place...moon valley. Really great experience for someone like me who usually travels alone. I met a swedish couple and week walked around for the",
          "I visited Moon Valley (or Valle de la Luna) as part of a day trip booked through Kanoo Tours (which also included a visit to Chacaltaya mountain for just $15 USD). It\u2019s located about 30 minutes South of the city centre &, although doesn\u2019t require a particularly long stay, is",
          "This was an included attraction as part of a packaged land tour. There was an entrance fee; but I'm not sure what it was, It is a neat place to visit; although nothing really special. It is definitely not handicapped accessible. The steps can be a little taxing as (keep in mind)",
          "We walked up from Colibri, and it was definitely cool to walk through - full disclaimer, we didn't get a guide - but I can't see someone going out of their way to see it. It's 15 bolivianos per person.",
          "Very interesting visit and for us a must see... Don't forget to take (or buy there) a bottle of water, sun glasses and a hat before you start the visit because altitude doesn't help and you will get tired very soon.",
          "This attraction is not far from the city of La Paz and it can be done in as little as 45 minutes. It is a beautiful landscpe,with some features which are just hard to imagine that actually do exist. There various points such as the 'Lady's hat', are features appearing on the",
          "First and foremost . . . HOLD ON TO YOUR KIDS!!! There are walk ways, but wow! Plenty of places for them to fall if you're not vigilant. It was nice, but after having visited the Badlands in the USA, this was nothing. I'd have given it a higher rating, but the low rating is",
          "This was an interesting place for the family to walk around and take pictures for an hour. It is strange how this place takes form and continues to change when it rains,",
          "This was my favorite experience in La Paz. It was amazing and totally unlike any other place I have visited. So much fun to walk around, great spot for fun photography. A must do experience. Be sure to take a good camera. The elevation maybe a problem for some and do take a",
          "Quite different to anything you've seen, a bit boring after a while since all the places have the same look.",
          "Not a great attraction but on a city tour it is worthy of a short visit, they are trying to encourage tourists and this is a historical part.",
          "We had a guided morning tour and were taken to Valle de la Luna. It was pretty cool but just something to have a quick visit. Not somewhere you'd hang around.",
          "Really easy to get to using a mini-bus (micro) or even a taxi. Very surreal landscape. Takes only a few hours to get there do the walking tour and get back to La Paz.",
          "I had half a day in La Paz and my host decided to take me to visit the moon valley landscape. It was a good choice. Close to La Paz and once there you will not believe that such a landscape could exist at such a high altitude but then geological explanations make it simple.",
          "We were staying out in this area, walking distant anyways, but I wouldn't definitely recommend this stop. Even as a day trip from La Paz I thought it was actually more worthwhile than Tiwanaku",
          "Amazing landscapes and crazy mountain forms! Seriously out of this world. A must do in La Paz, along with Teleferico and Dead Road.",
          "This is an interesting natural attraction with a unique landscape. Something you won't easily see elsewhere. It only takes about an hour to walk around it, so it makes for a good half day trip. No need to take a tour costing 40+ USD. Just get a taxi or public transport down to",
          "Valley of the Moon is worth the visit. Natural site that is quite interesting. Some shops in the tunnel as you enter the site. Great look at the surrounding hills and valleys as you traverse the various walking trails that provide an overlook to the area.",
          "We got a taxi from our hostel. It cost about 50 BOB each way. There is a bus but it is rather sporadic, tours are also expensive but shop around. We decided to walk around on our own and very much enjoyed ourselves- definately no need for a guide. Easily spent over and hour",
          "Interesting how this topography is similar with the Moon Valley in Chile but different colors. While Chile\u2019s red on contrast to the early, Bolivia\u2019s colors are more earthy and clayish. Both have cactus growing. If you take the double decker bus tour, you can take great photos",
          "a great way to adjust to altitude. you catch the teleferico to a lower altitude at 3200m and catch a 10 minute taxi to Val de Luna. was great to walk around this unusual attraction and not to taxing. the '45 minute' walk is more like 20 minutes.",
          "The landscape is great! you must take the long tour, not the short one. as long as you walk you will find some signs that tell you the figure you will see, it's a game for your mind, just great. As you have to walk do not go with babies, it's really tiring but totally worth it.",
          "Really Worth tour! Very interesting Rock Formations! It seems you outside the planet! Nice tourist structure too",
          "This is normally an attraction that follows Chacaltaya mountain. It is worth doing both. Valle de la Luna is in the city of La Paz, and offers a different scenario and excellent photo opportunities! If you have small children with you, make sure you hold them by the hand all",
          "We enjoyed Luna Valley & were happy we went given its proximity to the city, but wouldn't say it was a highlight of our trip so wouldn't prioritise it over other attractions",
          "First, consider visiting Falcon Valley on a way to Moon Valey. You will find interesting red rock formation there and great side view on La Paz. Moon Valley itself looks like great backery work in progress with piles of pancakes dough forming cones and other structures. Rocks",
          "It's an interesting rock/sand formation that you can see even from outside the park. A circuit of 45 min (which you can do in 20) or 15min (which you can probably do in 7). The entrance ticket is 15bs (around is$2.5) which is fine. If you have plenty of time in La Paz it's worth",
          "It is incredible and let us to think about th nature. You can get the Valle de la Luna by a classical tour with the Chacaltay Montain as well. You leave the city early to go to Chacaltaya and then you get the Valle de la Luna in the afternoon time, going back downtown La Paz in",
          "Valle de la Luna while a bit hard to navigate is incredible. The landscape is amazing! It is desolate and very much lives up to its name.",
          "We visited the morning of our very early arrival. It was an easy 20 minute ride from our hotel in la Zona Rosa. Admission was a few dollars and it is very cool to see. We were exhausted and didn't have much energy to hike around, but it would've been cool to do so. There is not",
          "We went to Valle de la Luna with low expectations having heard it was overly touristy and it is true. It's essentially a small portion of a valley set up with a gate for tourists and lots of trinkets for sale. For a real experience it is best to talk to locals and find some of",
          "Very different and beautiful place to visit. The 15 min walk is much shorter, 45 min walk is majestic.",
          "Really cool experience. This place feels like a smaller Bryce Canyon which others have mentioned before. Overall it's a beautiful place with stunning formations.. Only spoilt slightly by the residential areas surrounding it",
          "With gray rock formations and crevices, the Valley of the Moon is appropriately named. It's one of those places that, if you don't stop, you'll think you missed something. If you do stop, you'll ask, \"Why?\"",
          "A wonderful place to visit on a sunny day. We went on our own with a private car and spent a couple of hours walking around. It is an awesome place to visit but give yourself enough time if you have problems with the altitude. I did so I had to stops often to catch my breath.",
          "It is about 10 km from La Paz. Wear good hiking shoes, hat, and sunscreen.It is more like a maze of canyons. The formations are mostly composed of clay and sandstone created by erosion of mountains by the area's strong winds and rains. There are also several species of cactus",
          "We were on a city tour of La Paz and we suddenly arrived at this place (Moon Valley) which really does look like another planet. Great outcrops of stone, which have been eroded away to form, what look like stalagmites. Also has some interesting cacti.",
          "It is better than the mood, Neil Armstrong said. We felt the same way. Great place for photographers. We even had the luck to see strange desert animals, something like rabbits with long tails.",
          "It's well worth your while to go and check out the unusual a d lovely scenery at Valle de la Luna. Due to a public transport blockade we missed out on Valle de la Luna on our tour the day before. A lady at a tour agency told us it was uncertain if the blockade would continue so",
          "Take a taxi from La Paz and then rent an ATV for two hour trip to the miradors watching on the valle. Nice attraction for half a day.",
          "Awesome inexpensive activity to get out of the busy urban La Paz. I went on my own in a taxi and was a great little afternoon trip. Highly recommend it if you have extra time in La Paz.",
          "Don't need more than half an hour at this place. It is in the middle of the city and this destroys the impression.",
          "Not a common site seeing location, nature at its best. Make sure you have good shoes and plenty of water.",
          "I came expected to be hiking... This wasn't entirely my experience. Its a great place to go and take pictures, and you definitely do some walking, but other reviews called it a hike which frankly isn't true. From sopocachi, I took a cab for 40 Bs. It is accessible in minibuses,",
          "We visited the Valle de la Luna as part of a city bus tour & were surprised how close it was to the main city. We were given 20 mins to roam about and that was plenty of time to see the sights. Not a must see but not bad as part of a larger tour.",
          "It was a great experience. Requires some moderate walking through the valley. Only went on the 20 minute route although the whole circuit could get to be 45 minutes. Breathtaking.",
          "Totally worth the visit. .. your family back home won't believe the pictures! Take lots of water, as it is hot - and even a parasol - and the sun is probably always shining. I found the few shops near the entrance very interesting and well priced, having seen many similar",
          "The local tourist guide tolds us, that famous american astronaut Neil Armostrong visited this valley and told, that it\u00b4s looks like a surface on the Moon. Commercial for the tourist. But if you have time, you can visit it. I was.",
          "It is easy to get there, taking the local bus you get there in a hour. All stars in San Francisco square.",
          "Stopped off as part of a tour. This is an amazing peace of natural phenonima and worth a look. We stayed around 30 minutes but you can take the entire walk around the lunar landscape in around 3 hours. Great ice cream shop across the road......",
          "If we were just visiting Moon Valley you would probably give it 5 stars but when you have also spent several days on the salt flats and atacarma desert it is not so stunning. If you are in La Paz and have some time it is certainly worth a visit. If you do go then I would",
          "This place is amazing! Really cool landscape and nice tracks around. We caught a taxi from San Pedro square for about 50 and then made our way to the cable car for a scenic route back. Cheap entry and nice way to see more of La Paz",
          "Very odd place but also quite small and everything is the same. Sure, the place has some striking views but Im not sure Id spend the time going there again.",
          "You need to allow a couple of hours to explore the many paths through this lunar-like landscape. Very unusual, it has been compared to the \"badlands\" landscapes of Montana. Mostly clay hoodoo-like protuberances, some with imaginative names, it's a great place to spend a couple",
          "A very interesting place to see and to walk by, take pictures and enjoy in a very different environment near La Paz downtown.",
          "Valle dela Luna or Valley of the Moon, that's what they call it. A labyrinth of lunar-like surroundings that is definitely out of this world. The wonders of nature never fail to surprise me!",
          "Nice place but i wouldn't think you need to spend too much time here. It's really hot in the afternoons, so bring water and sunscreen and a cap. There's a slight smell in the air, but besides that, its ok!",
          "Is a realy boring tour. The place is realy interesting, but if you went to Chacaltaya before, you'll be realy tired when you arrive here.",
          "They charge 15 bs to get in, and there are two paths walk through the valley (15 or 45 minutes each, your call). The valley itself is beautiful; it looks like miniature mountains and there's pathways and vistas along it\u2013 very safe and easy to walk through. I really recommend it.",
          "Amazing landscape the likes of which I had not seen anywhere. A must on your visit to La Paz. We got there fairly early on a fabulous clear day and beat the crowds.",
          "Went here as part of a City Tour and was very pleased to have done so. It was uncrowded and the shorter walk around the site gave you a good idea of what life on the moon must be like. If it was good enough for Neil Armstrong it will be good enough for you. Great photo",
          "Worth a visit to see a lunar type landscape. ... there are 2 options a quick 15 min circuit or the longer 45 min. We did the latter and were reasonably impressed. 45 mins is plenty of time to see all. We (4 of us) arranged for a taxi to take us there and wait the hour before",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit the the Moon Valley. The landscape was interesting and did feel like a moonscape in the city. There are 2 circuits that can be followed: a 15 minute one and a 45 minute one (that takes about 30 minutes if you walk briskly). There are gift shops on",
          "It's about a 20 minute cab ride from Plaza San Pedro. It really looks like a moonscape in side of the city. They have 2 trails- 15 minutes and 45 minutes but it takes slightly less time. Great place for photos.",
          "Very surreal and uplifting experience! It's like nothing you have ever experienced earlier no matter how much you travel (I've traveled a lot). It's also very safe with security guards and clean and well maintained which is a big plus for me. Five stars! *****",
          "An interesting place to visit, but not a must see when in La Paz. To be fair whilst on a tour we were pushed for time, but I cannot see how more than 30 mins is required here",
          "You need to manage your expectations when going. You will need some water, some good walking/hiking shoes and ready for some stairs and light climbing. Also remember the bathroom will have little or no tissue. Seeing many rock formations in Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and even",
          "An amazing location right in La Paz. You can get there by local bus but taxi's are not expensive and yes they are quicker. The landscape is impossible to describe. Moonscape? Pretty close. They have added traditional dressed musicians standing on rock pinnacles playing flutes to",

          "Bolivia boasts landscapes like nowhere else on Earth, and Valle de la Luna is no exception. The story goes that this place used to be called Valley of the Spirits, until Neil Armstrong (visiting Bolivia as he'd seen the salt flats from space and made a point of visiting upon his",

          "This place is very unlikely so close to La Paz but it was very interesting to see and the Age of the valley is impressive",
          "Our group took a tour of the Valley of the Moon one afternoon and everyone loved it. The landscape is very unique and beautiful in a strange way. It's worth seeing if you're in La Paz.",
          "Moon valley was nice itself to walk around. But the staff was so unwelcoming not letting us in around 4pm because the staff finishes at 6pm the lady at the office was very rude",
          "Visited here as part of the city tour, it was our first stop. Lovely walk around the moonscape, lots of twists and turns some nice views. Went in the morning before the sun got too hot as there is no shade.",
          "A collection of hoodoos just outside of La Paz. We enjoyed it in the morning mid week and only enountered a few other people. A cholita caretaker happily posed with us for pictures, even insisting we wear her bowler hat. Be careful not to drop anything as there's no going",
          "We booked a 4PM sunset tour of the Valley de la Luna through Whipala Tours. The entrance of the Valley costs 3000CHP (2500CHP for students). The views are spectacular everywhere and look more like Mars than the Moon. We started with a walk through a salt cave, then hiked an hour",
          "Just a 10km ride from the centre of La Paz lies The Valley of the Moons, a unique landscape formed by the wind. The monoliths are made from sandstone and have been eroded over centuries from the strong winds. Really a bit like on the moon. There are lots of little canyons and",

          "Good place if you like a walk between some strange rock formations. Actually there are some really nice similar rock formations further down along the river in a more natural and grander environment, where you do not have to pay an entrance fee. I go there a lot to walk. Never",
          "This was okay for a couple of hours (max). It was a faff to get to and underwhelming when we got there. Don't get me wrong, it was really cool and interesting to see but I think we expected more. Worth doing if you have spare time in La Paz but don't be overly worried if you",
          "The valley of the moon was a very interesting area of rock/sand/clay formations. We were told the area is eroding and will be gone in another 80-100 years. It does not take long to view the area but it is well worth the trip.",
          "An awesome natural wonder.... And source of exercise! One of the most impressive things is the sheer size. Until you get amongst it you don't get an idea of the scale. It's a mad place.... And I'm not joking about hide and seek either! Let your hair down and try it! You'll need",

          "This is an interesting place to go if you're in La Paz, but if you've seen other badlands (e.g. Badlands National Park, Theodore Roosevelt NP) you may be underwhelmed. When I went, there seemed to be a pervasive smell of garbage. Regardless, the trip down is interesting to see",
          "If you visit La Paz city, please spend some time at Valle de la Luna and feel yourself as walking on the moon ;)",

          "I did the trip for 25 bolivianos by using local transport. I caught a bus with Mallasi as the destination close to San Francisco. I asked the driver to tell me when we got to the right place. The colours of the rocks are beautiful and there is a path that takes 45 minutes",
          "Nice place to go although not exciting. Good to spend an hour if you have nothing else to do. We had it as part of our day tour.",

          "It was our privilege to visit this area prior to our reluctant departure from La Paz. The rovk formations remind me a little of Bryce Canyon in Utah, USA. It is definitely worth an hour of your time when you are visiting La Paz",
          "This was a very enjoyable stop on a tour of La Paz. Outside the central city area, it is reminiscent of Capadoccia in Turkey, with natural spires and jagged formations formed by erosion. Not the kind of topography you might expect in an area surrounded by towering mountains,",
          "One of the attractions here in La Paz, an incredible set of naturally sculptured sand stone which has resulted in a surreal setting.",
          "The place is not so atractive to me. But it's a good place to kill some times when you are free in La Paz since it takes around 40 minutes to get there. The place is well organized.",
          "An easy walk through some fascinating surreal landscape right in La Paz . At the highest point ---not very high-- there can be some strong winds. So if you take children on the walk, hold their hands. We had a good buffet lunch at a restaurant (we think in the Belevedere",

          "Went there with a small group and walked several of the paths. Very interesting rock formations easily accessed by several paths of differing difficulty, but none too hard. Some of the views were spectacular.",
          "I came here back in 2010 and found it very interesting. From what I recall they had like 2 or 3 different paths you can take. There were some parts of the path that seemed somewhat dicey to walk on but that just made it more exciting to walk through. Although its not a place",
          "It is a great place to escape from the La Paz, something that you would not expect in the middle of such city. It is really good organized with city bus tour as it stops there for 20' so you can have time to enjoy it and then get back to the bus!",
          "The valley is located just out side of La Paz. It has interesting rock formations. Takes a little less than an hour to hike through the site. If you have some free time it is worth a visit.",
          "Nice place, but they have to learn how to became a touristic point the little roads must be fixed to be a great place",
          "This very nice valley located just outside the city of La Paz is relatively small, but shows all the same traits of the Cappadocia valleys in Turkey, with unusual rock formations and amazing colours! Highly recommended if you're in the area!",

          "After being in the city it was nice to get out into the open. Health and safety probably wouldn't pass it in the uk. There are quite a lot of places you could fall and the rails had seen better days.",

          "Cool valley located south of the city. There are two routes to take, one 15 minutes and one 45 minutes. Take the 45 minute route, but don't plan to stay much longer. A neat place to see, but 45 minutes is long enough.",
          "When we went, it was quite. We didn't take a tour, we just wondered round. For anyone interested in geological landmarks, this is awesome. A cheap taxi ride out, and a fun way to kill an hour just outside la paz.",

          "I would recommend heading to Valle de la Luna if you find yourself having a free day in La Paz. It's a nice way to get out of the city and provide a more dynamic and understanding experience of the city. To get their without a guided group from the center start by heading to",

          "This used to be Valley of the Spirits until Neil Armstrong likened it to the surface of the moon. It is startling to see this in the midst of a major urban area. If you are in La Paz, try to get away from the downtown and see this site. It will certainly add another dimension",
          "It is, as my title suggests, a really interesting landscape, but personally I wouldn't have missed it if I hadn't have gone. There is some guy who climbs up on one of the columns to play his pipes but beware trying to take a photo without first showing him the money; he has a",

          "I did not manage to see it from inside, as it was closed when we reched there ( and we spent only one day and 2 nights in Bolivia) From outside it looked beautiful and different. If I will return to Bolivia, for sure this will be the firts place to visit again, so can see it",
          "Beautiful natural formations... too bad lots has been destroyed for housing. Be sure to take water and a snack.",
          "The Valle de la Luna is a very interesting place to walk through. It is not very expensive and you can take the 45 minute route to get the most for your money. The valley is also very close to La Paz so you can easily get there by cab for cheap. However I would recommend that",
          "The scenery is very different, lunar appears a good description, but nothing changes during the whole walk around. Worth a 30 minute look.",
          "This place is so interesting, such a different type of land scape and really looks like you're on the moon. Had a great guide but since it's located at the bottom of the city anyone can go there easily and just pay the entrance fee.",
          "This is a really cheap afternoon trip from La Paz, we spent a couple of hours there pottering around and climbing on the rocks and had a great time. Taxi up there should be quite cheap and the entrance is similarly small (can't remember exactly how much). Definitely a lot more",
          "We saw beautiful places with natural erosion, there are awesome landscapes and it is really close to La Paz 20 minutes and you can go for 5 Bs on a public bus that will leave you right in front of the atracttion. It's a good trip for one afternoon or morning :)",

          "This is a great place to visit if you like outdoors. Be prepared with good walking shoes and a sunhat and water to drink. This place as it is aptly named is indeed a bit of moon on earth.For most of us who cant go to the moon,this is the closest experience one can get of the",
          "I opted for the 45min walk - the longest. I was underwhelmed by the walk, sure it had natural structures and the pathway in between everything was cool. But, I was a little bit bored walking around. I would have liked to see more information about the structures. It was",
          "I went there on a motorcycle tour which I highly recommend. You were able to cover lots of ground without getting too tired. This place is probably no more then 20 mins away from the city center. We took public transportation for 1.5 bolivianos which dropped us right in front.",
          "It is like a moonscape with all the erosion and construction work around it. Valle de la Luna is worth at least a short visit especially if it is part of a city tour. See its photos before decising if it is for you. I did the short visit and did not take the hour-long long",
          "This quite small but interesting area is really worth a visite. The canyon like structures are beautiful to wander around. Be sure to wear sensible shoes, as there's a lot of climbing up and down, and the ground has quite a few holes dug out by the rain. It gets very hot here",
          "Moon Valley is a highlight of a La Paz visit. It's otherworldly and great to see. There are two walking options (a quick 15 minute visit, and a longer 45 minute loop). Both allow you to see the rock formations and take photos. It's a short drive out from the main historic",
          "The place is nice, with very interesting rock formations. It's not an attraction that will blow you away but it's still worth visiting if you have time to spare. There are two paths to choose from - 45min walk and 15min walk. We went for a 45 min one although I am guessing the",
          "We take the tour bus in the downtown of La Paz to the south area of the city, we go through the richest neighborhoods to end in a valley that is so impressive that you start to imagine millions of years before the city was there all the valley maybe was cover with water o maybe",
          "Having been to many a Moon Valley ( in Namibia and Chile), didn't have very high expectations from this. However once we reached there, we were blown away by the beauty of the place. Spent a good 1.5 hours exploring and walking through well marked routes. Key positives -",
          "It was ok to visit but I could easily have lived without it. It's a small area and the cliffs aren't that high. I don't know why it's in all the tourist books. The lesser known Valle de las Animas has much higher cliffs and is more adventurous to visit. Take a bus towards Palca",
          "I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this site as I found it less than appealing. Some of the walkways were not overly safe. The formations took a lot of imagination to work out what they were. Mind you we have been to the North American National Parks, so have been spoilt.",

          "It's a cool place located not too far from the city center. It only takes you around 20 minutes by a cab. If you have time, just pay a visit here. It takes around an hour to walk through the Moon Valley. Overall an exotic experience but it's not something that you cannot be",

          "Valle de La Luna is a cool moonlike landscape outside of La Paz. The surrounding area is beautiful with mountains as far as the eye can see. Valle de la Luna costs 15 bolivianos to enter and takes about an hour to hike through. It's an otherworldly place, but definitely not",
          "During our stay in La Paz, we weren't planning on visiting Valle de la Luna, but some friends who took us on a tour of the city brought us there and it was really nice. The whole area is quite impressive, bleak, very devoid of vegetation, somewhat peacefull (we went late",

          "There are two trails as many have mentioned. A 15 minute trail that really takes 5 minutes and a 45 minute trail that took us a little over an hour (granted this may be due to picture taking). Overall impressive views. If it is not too hot, it was worth a visit to see this",
          "About 15 mins from the town, this place is something you wont experience while walking around La Paz. Nice to see, interesting natural forms, helpfull staff, and a different place to spend an hour or two walking around and exploring.",
          "Pretty good attraction that you can bike to easily enough. Seems like a bit of a slog on the way there, but it's actually mostly downhill on the way back and you can see the sunset and get back in time to drop the rental bikes off in time before most places close. Defo recommend",
          "i liked that it had a trail.... hmmm it didnt have a guide... i didnt like the part that it is too far away from downtown",

          "A breathtaking landscape on the outskirts of the city. Costs 15 Bolivianos per person to enter. There are 2 trails - a 15 minute trail and a 45 minute trail. We did the 45 minute trail and it was well worth it. There were lots if opportunities to take pictures. Some areas don't",
          "I had no idea what to expect but as we drove upwards from the centre of LaPaz it got more and more intriguing. My guide was giving me lots of information, which was extremely interesting but I thoroughly enjoyed the walk through the area. Should I return to LaPaz I would",

          "Lovely and quiet place. Evening, sunset time was perfect time to visit for me.",
          "beautiful view, but kind of dangerous. if you 0lan to come here with children, please make sure they stick close to you at all times. otherwise, very beautiful place, very breathtaking.",
          "Google said they are open until 5:30pm. We got there at 4:40pm. The lady at the entrance gate said they are closed at 4pm. and didn\u2019t let us in. We\u2019ve traveled from far away to visit this place. And we don\u2019t have much time to stay in La Paz. I\u2019m so disappointed. Hopefully they are clear with their hour.",
          "Nice spot to relax not too far from the city center",
          "It's a nice place to just look around and click some pics. Other than that i don't think it has something interesting.",
          "Dramatic landscape, great spot for photos, meditation (on a quiet day during off season) and a nice walk. \n\nThe entrance is 3 bolivianos for locals and 15 for foreigners. \n\nIt is easy to get here from La Paz by public transport, \u2018colectivo\u2019 minib\u00fas. This journey will cost just 2.60 bolivianos each way.",
          "Surely interesting geological rock formation. However, the site is surrounded by houses and it doesn't have a feeling of special site. No shops, no restaurants.",
          "Erosion at its very best. Dry to the extreme, an interesting place to visit if you are in La Paz with two hours to kill. Fee to enter less than $3. Some parts of the trail outside the main path are a bit scary with no handrail in sight. Overall a must see.",
          "Great spot for interesting geology and formations. For lighting avoid am as the sun cast large shadows. Best to go around noon or later. No handicap accessible. No guard rails in some areas so be careful but worth a visit.",
          "Spectacular rock formation near La Paz center!!",
          "Nice geological formation. A bit too close to the city, that remove some of the charm of the place.",
          "Minibus will get you there from downtown for cheap, but the ride\u2019s about 45 minutes. Can probably count on spending no more than an hour walking the trail. Plenty of steep walking paths like the city, but with better scenery.",
          "You don\u2019t need to take expensive tour to Valle de la Luna. Easy to get there by Teleferico and mini bus. My hostel was located near by blue line, so took it and changed green line to end.  Walk 10mins to Calle 8 Calacoto and take a minibus \u2026",
          "A beautiful place with a stunning views and an interesting history. Take a city tour and you will not be disappointed.",
          "Interesting place to visit if nothing else to do in La Paz. To get there and back from center can take long, specially in rush hours. Walk there is just around 45 min.",
          "Awesome. This is mis is it in La Paz",
          "Worth a visit. Nice park with interesting and beautiful rock formations.",
          "Beautiful and cool to see, but some photos can be misleading as they don't show the true size of the geological formations. Don't expect colossal mountains, but there are some very cool sightseeing spots and it can be a relaxing place if there's not too many people.",
          "Amazing place, is like to real moon",
          "It's an amazing sight to behold. Easy to get to by bus, I spent about 2 hours there wandering around and marveling at the spires and remains of erosion. You can 'do it' faster if you don't have time, but it's worth the trip if you have half a day. There are places where you can fall if you wander off the main route and are not careful.",
          "Incredible place to be.  Rock formation are amazing.  There is a charge for entrance. Its at a altitude of 3600 plus above sea level.  So travellers dont exert yourself.  Take it easy.  They loose points because their direction are very \u2026",
          "I'm giving this 5 stars because it is simply beautiful and it's a must see if you are visiting La Paz. Make sure you wear plenty of sunscreen as there is barely any shade. I would wear a hat and keep hydrated. They say follow the arrows but they are all mixed up...that is my only complaint. Again...this place is simply beautiful.",
          "I can see how this place is interesting from a geological perspective but the expansive and ugly human development around it completely detracts from any reason to enjoy it now. Wouldn't recommend a visit unless you happen to be in the area.",
          "There are better places further away fr houses and roads that are still accessible.",
          "F a n t a s t i c !\nYou can take a tour and visit Chacaltaya the same day ...\nYou will enjoy both",
          "Really unique out of this world landscape! But after walking around for a bit the whole place pretty much looks the same. \n\nTook a cable car over and the got a taxi directly to the entrance instead of taking the bus.",
          "Nice place to visit with a good viewpoint. It will take you around 45 minutes to walk around.",
          "Worth the visit if it's part of your guided city tour. Nice but not a must-see",
          "A cool 1 or 2 hour trip to the very strange place. It looks like a set from Star Wars. Bring water and SUNSCREEN. It is cool but not an OMG YOU NEED TO SEE THIS cool.",
          "It's ok..",
          "Gorgeous place.. Easy hike. The entry cost is 15 bolivianos which is a little expensive. Other than, enjoyed our visit to this place thoroughly!",
          "Amazing place, 15 and 45 mins routes but it takes longer than that 'cause of how breathtaking it is, chill out, bring water and have and amazing time. 15 bolivianos for tourists",
          "I liked it very much. It is a very different landscape. It is supposed to be the closest to the moon landscape on earth according to astronaut Neil Armstrong. The visit is short you can walk around and see the rock formations. i recommend it.",
          "Beutiful natural phenomenon in the midst of the city - very easy to access.",
          "Cool rock formations that are only 30 mins drive from downtown La Paz.",
          "I love this place, but it is necessary more security",
          "Very cool rock formations pretty close to La Paz. Def recommend as a few hours to get out of the city. We didn\u2019t take the telef\u00e9rico and bus/taxi , which we heard was fairly easy. But we did have our hostel call us a taxi, which we paid 140 Bolivianos to take us there, wait an hour, and drive us back.",
          "Its a beautiful park to walk around and take nice photos. Its bloody hot thou. And have to wear long sleeves due to sun radiation.",
          "Well worth a visit and close to La Paz. There and back in under 2 hours including time to take the longer path around the moon.",
          "Very nice place to go and just chill a little bit, the rocks are amazing here and you can take a lot of nice pictures",
          "Very cool, nice birds and viscacha",
          "Was an interesting place to visit.  But it's over populated with homes around the rock formations which ruins the vibe.",
          "A must-see place around La Paz.",
          "Wonderful place!",
          "Great place to take a motor bike and ride for two to three hours, really liked it was tons of fun and around 150bs for 2hours",
          "Nice to see, but not my highlight in La Paz",
          "\"Mallasa valley\"' it is an extrange formation of rocks from about 4500 millions of years,  spectacular view of mountain moon scenery. It is about 45 minutes by car from La Paz city",
          "Super cool landscape! Looks alien. The guide told us that it was an American astronaut that said it resembles a moon landscape - hence the name.\nIt is all made of clay, and therefore its shapes will constantly alter and eventually deteriorate\ud83d\ude25",
          "Really cool park not too far out of the city. The hike around the park is pretty easy and the rock formations are very unique and picturesque. It really does feel like you\u2019re walking on another planet! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d",
          "If you've never seen these kind of pinnacles before, then you may enjoy this more, especially with a guided tour for more information about how the valley was formed. Though we've seen some quite grand views of other pinnacles so for us it was an unfair comparison I feel.",
          "\ud83c\udf1f",
          "We went when it was raining. Good thing - very few people. Bad thing - super muddy and slippery. I highly recommend hiking shoes if you come during bad weather. The place is a nice escape from the city. Cost 15Bs per person for entrance fee. The place looks like it'll erode soon so go soon.",
          "Top",
          "A cool place to see...be ready to walk",
          "Good experience, really beautiful place. Unfortunately there's only a few places where you can stand and watch, without having a path or some other tourists in your field of view.\n\nGo for an hour or so, have a good time, but don't expect to get close to nature :)"

        "wiki": "The Witches' Market, also known as El Mercado de las Brujas and La Hechiceria, is a popular tourist attraction located in Cerro Cumbre, a mountain clearing in La Paz, Bolivia. Merchandise sold in The Witches' Market, run by local witch doctors known as yatiri, includes potions, dried frogs, medicinal plants like retama and armadillos used in Bolivian rituals. The yatiri can be easily identified by their black hats and coca pouches containing amulets, talismans and powders that ensure luck, beauty and fertility. Most famous of all the items sold in The Witches' Market are the dried llama fetuses. These llama fetuses are buried under the foundations of many Bolivian houses as a sacred offering to the goddess Pachamama.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Mercado de las Brujas at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Visited the Las Bruchas and found it special. Textiles, fruits were of the highest quality and at best price compared to Chile and to Peru",
          "You cannot say that you have been to La Paz without mention the Witches Market or Mercado de las brujas, it is the most amazing place. You will be able to find handmade crafts, silver, wool as well as items for witchcraft. There are a line up of stores to buy from, either to fix",
          "Colorful market area where theres plenty to shop for if you're looking for souvenirs. worth at least a walk through and if you're looking to buy you'll definitely find something!",
          "You have the Mercado de las brujas with all \u201cspecials\u201d ingredients and there costumes. Take advantage and ask the meaning of things. People are really nice and like to explain there costumes. On the other streets you will find a lot of gifs mainly with the typical tissues like",
          "The Witch's Market was smaller than we thought, but it was still very interesting for us to see as it was not similar to things we have seen in other places. The fact that these are still popular and actively in use was amazing for us, especially offering baby llamas!",
          "Best area to see and contact the bolivian traditions, with them colorful and beautiful things. You can buy a lot of souvenirs at incredible lower price, and you can bargain. Don't miss! (and buy one more suitcase).",
          "If you miss this, you have not missed out on much. Odd things for sale which was not going to make it into my suitcase. I doubt customs would have been happy with. Taking pictures was also a no no. I appreciate that what they sell is useful in their culture.",
          "I started a great day with running gear and a route they took me right into the Mercado to see it all at a jog pace and then go back to get the goodies I liked\u2026 12,000 is the highest altitude I\u2019ve ever run at and boy does it take a toll on you\u2026 Kind of feels like being drunk in",
          "This is one of the world\u2019s oddest markets with the appropriate name, Witches Market. Yes, you can get potions here to cure what ails you. Supposed remedies are here to solve fertility problems, altitude sickness, initiate curses, help with the present and afterlife, bring luck,",
          "I was expecting a big long street with many shops the display witches & animals. However, it is small short street with less than 5 shops that displays those things. In my opinion, there are many streets that are much nicer than this one.",
          "Interesting to see how the belief in Pachamama is still very much alive. Strange objects for sale. Small area behind San Francisco church.",
          "Interesting to see and peruse the 'goods' The stalls selling the outlandish items like Llama fetus's etc' are just a few at the end of the street. I got the impression it would be bigger, but most of the other stalls just the usual fridge magnetey tourist stuff! ... But well",
          "The witches market is interesting. The stores sell magic powders and spells but it seems to be mainly aimed at tourists. I thought there were shamans there but If you want to see a shaman or have your fortune read you need to ask one of the store owners to organise it.",

If we hadn\u2019t of had a guide we probably wouldn\u2019t have got anything out of coming here. He got the lady to show us some of the things she did ... and also told",
          "It's the same as every other market with around 5 stalls all with a load of dead llamas hanging in the doorway. How does this even get a mention above the rest of the market stalls in the area. You must be desperate if you go here especially to see the trash you probably",

          "Visit the witches and take in their offerings. Visit the shops that have Touristica stuff and also Artizan counterparts. You can find the level of opportunity you wish. A lot of the things are the same wherever you go but pockets of treasures are worth the journey. A fun area.",

          "Interesting things, special ambience, fairly shocking items such as dead llama babies. If you get the explanation - you might understand. It is another culture and it requires tolerance.",

          "Tipical souvenir market and just a couple of stores with crazy things. Best place in La Paz to buy local souvenirs, silver accessories, alpaca sweaters, handbags etc. Definitely worth to see.",
          "If you end in the Witches market, keep in mind that the ladies selling there are not happy with tourists taking pictures of them. Gently ask them if it is OK to take pictures of the stands (that's often the case), but try to leave the lady out. They will curse you, if you try",
          "We walked around for a while to find the witches market and realised we'd been walking through it the whole time. There's not much to see, just a couple of stores on a street. Couldn't say it was much different to a usual souvenir market. Nothing we would buy either. Was nice to",
          "A visual overload as you try to understand what your eyes are seeing. This is most amazing. Talk to the vendors and have them explain what is this all used for. Explore the side streets and the local street food vendors. Whow !!",
          "If you looking for Alpaca jumper, socks or scarf or anything else traditional it is touristy indeed, but still a must and lovely just to indulge into the vibrant colours, to watch the Cholitas, to find some personal treasure or something to bring home.",
          "We visited the witches market with a local guide and we learned about the fascinating history of this place. Without a guide I don't know how interesting it would be as a lot of the quirks and oddities require some explanation (llama fetuses, shamans etc)",
          "people say its a touristic point but like everything in bolivia its just a way to make you go there and spend some money. theres nothing usefull to buy in this street except for the clothing. waste of time and money",

          "Great place to walk around for a few hours, enjoy the up and down hills, get some local souvenirs, and eat some snacks/drink some juices. People on the shops are so nice, friendly, and welcoming. We found more varieties of locally made souvenirs, alpaca sweaters, handbags,",
          "The street is filled with colourfull touristic shops. It is the ideal place to find your souvenirs. The dried baby lamas they are selling makes the place special as well.",

          "Some of the guides I read mentioned that apart from regular touristy merchandise the market is famous for some unusual goods such as voo doo dolls etc. Now I'm not into that but I would happily have a look as it's something I haven't seen before. None of that there, just your",
          "visit this place and it is very interesting, they sell a lot of typical crafts of the country and you can find everything for gifts and souvenirs, lots of natural plant to take, if you feel bad for the height. I highly recommend visiting this place within the city. Great",
          "We went here by taxi but the journey was very stop start with the emphasis on \"Stop.\" Left the taxi to walk there - it was a bit of a climb so be prepared. It is a very famous market and one worth visiting but whilst my partner was keen to go into the clothes' shops, I quickly",
          "My girlfriend visited La Paz 5 years ago and was really disappointed with the Witches market this time round. They offer a huge variety of tourist aimed souvenirs at next to nothing prices which is obviously good. However, it\u2019s more just market than \u2018Witches\u2019 market these days.",

          "Had a lovely ramble around. Quite breathless as we weren\u2019t used to the altitude of La Paz, so took it easy going up the hill to get there. Bought some nice little gifts. Very colourful and wonderful for photos. We didn\u2019t haggle, perhaps we should have, but really, things are so",
          "Besides the \"interesting\" llama foetuses, most of the stalls sell the same stuff. Interesting for a walk, but too orientated to the occasional tourist to meet my personal taste.",
          "I had great expectations for Mercado de las Brujas. I hoped it would be bigger. Nevertheless it was very interesting to visit it. I am 100% sure that people actually use that stuff, not only sell it for tourists.",
          "The witches market has lots of tourist shops with all kinds of good priced items. You can see the traditional shops with alpaca babies en fetusses.",
          "This is the place to come to have a concoction made to ward off, heal or bring good fortune for whatever you desire. There are dried llama fetuses hanging at the entrance of the shops which will supposedly bring you good luck when put into the foundation of the house you are",
          "Where else can you find dried llama fetuses to use as offerings, mixtures of herbs for what ails you, coca leaves to help alleviate altitude sickness and a wide variety of weird and interesting amulets for protection and prosperity? At the 'witches market' in La Paz. There are",
          "Great spot to go and a definite must-see destination if you head to La Paz. A lot of history in this area but also some great places to grab some small bites and plenty of places to buy gifts and things. Ended up buying a loooooooot of stuff",
          "I didn\u00b4t know before going to the witches market that still people can buy offerings to worship ancient gods. Stuff for good luck, to attract love even black magic stuff can be found. Highly recommended if you want to see the believings of the people",
          "If you are in La Paz, you must visit el Mercado de las Brujas! Here, you can buy a bunch of Coca leaves to chew and battle La Paz altitude. Also, if you are into witch-craft,you can get some amulets. The market offers a wide selection of natives crafts....before you buy try",
          "Lots of stuff. Handicrafts, musical instruments, all down different streets / aisles. The witches area has lots of herbs, charms, and yes, dried up llama fetuses.",
          "Combined with San Francisco and plaza Murillo, this is a classic must do day stroll in La Paz. Nice local gifts, folklore, and traditional curiosities.",
          "Was expecting a bit more when we first walked through by ourselves. You can literally walk in and out of a shop in 2 mins. We then went through again with a walking tour and had the full spiel. Very interesting once you actually know what you\u2019re looking at",
          "The place lacks authenticity, there are only a handful of shops selling plants. I was looking for a common local plant but none of the places had it or seemed to know anything about plants or natural remedies. There stacked with industrial made mixes, selling coca leaves and",
          "Slightly gruesome yet fascinating view into local folklore. Worth walking through, part of the La Paz scene.",
          "I first entered the witches market on the red caps walking tour. I returned to have a closer look at the items for sale, and to buy some offerings to bring good luck... They are squares of sugar painted with different images, to bring you good luck, health, money, love etc For",

          "One of the must visit places in La Paz. This is a beautiful street with many weird things to see in the stores. Apart from that you can find cheap souvenirs in there.",
          "This is an interesting street to walk down. We were able to pick up some fun and interesting knick knacks to take home for our friends.",
          "It is small and feels geared mostly to tourists. I still enjoy seeing these things so I was happy to visit, but I was definitely not compelled to buy anything and struggled even to find good photos to take",
          "There was undoubtedly a time when this was a center for curandero/as, curing, charms and such from a long tradition of Bolivian native traditions, but that time seems to have passed. Today, the street is lined with Argentine travelers selling tchotchkes and small shops all",
          "There are some really interesting herbs and products at this little market - next to the tourist stuff. I hope the dried Lama babies and fetuses didn't need to suffer. They apparently mean good luck when they are built into a house's wall. I haven't seen anybody buy one though.",
          ".... although I wasn't sure about the Lama babies and fetuses. I hope they did not suffer. My girls could not look at them. But very interesting products they have in these stores.",
          "This looked intriguing on the Hotel map of La Paz, so I checked it out. It's a street with a number of shops selling various products associated with magic - like those types of shops in New Orleans - little trinkets and natural products. Worth a look. It then morphs into shops",
          "I regret not having enough time to hang around Witches Market. It sells stuff that cannot be found in Peru (as I just visited Peru and Bolivia this time). Look for a little knit bag with Llama shape, super cute! I can just spend the whole afternoon in the market but still some",
          "Here you can find all sorts of herbal potions, dried llama fetuses to offer up to Pachamama, statues of Ekeko both modern and more traditional. This god of abundance, his lips blackened by all the cigarette offerings is festooned with miniature things you hope to bring into",
          "I was really excited to see the Witches Market's in Bolivia, though I had thought they were up in El Alto. So I was interested when my husband googled and said they were right near the Coca Museum. Ummm...no, these aren't it. If you don't want to trek up to El Alto where you",
          "I went to this market which is mainly two blocks with little shops that sell from herbs and magic potions, to beautiful handicrafts. Good way to interact and support locals.",
          "Although the \"brujas\" are part of bolivian coulture, for foreiners, it sounds a little scary, specially when you see llamas fetos in front of the stores. But to get envolved with bolivian culture, it worth the visit!",
          "The Mercado de Las Brujas, otherwise known as the witches market, is a common tourist attraction near the downtown area in La Paz. It is a unique market full of ancient remedies and unique items. Llama fetuses are displayed everywhere, as the locals commonly bury them underneath",

          "I was in La Paz in 2007 and I remember visiting the \"Mercado de la Hechicer\u00eda\" back then. It wasn't a tourist attraction, just a couple of streets lined by shabby esoteric shops. But it was charming, exotic, and mysterious. I saw some women sitting on a low wall, waiting, and",

          "Having traveled the world, many of these markets look the same. This is enough different to make it interesting. Worth seeing.",
          "A few streets of stores that sell everything remotely witchy. Some store owners can speak English so they can give you a very good explanation of what each trinket is for. Overall very interesting if you wish to delve into the symbolism and rituals of the Bolivian people.",
          "Having seen some disappointed reviews online about the market, we weren't sure what to expect. Yes, the vendors are mainly catering to tourists and yes, it is actually a littler smaller than expected. However, if you take the time to explore all the shops, alleyways and",

          "I came here with high hopes, and maybe that was the problem. Not anywhere near as good as I was expecting but if you are looking to kill time it might suffice.",
          "As I'm sure you know, the witches market specialises in ancient traditional remedies including Llama foetuses. However when you get there, there's only 6 or 7 such stalls. Other than the foetuses most other stuff is kept in jars etc. Overall interesting to look at, just a shame",
          "This was a block from my hotel. I visited it on my first day and didn't think too much of it. I took a picture or two and moved on. Enjoy!!",
          "We stayed in a hotel very close to this market. I consider the market \"per se\" a very interesting anthopological experience, since you can find there a lot of things you would never see in any place (such as dead baby llamas and dead llamas fetus). It's important to be informed",
          "Just a few touristy businesses, nothing else to see. The history is worth visiting, but not the shops.",
          "We came here on our first evening in La Paz and we really liked the market. It was close to our accomodation so we went there lots of time. Its a Mix of creppy things, widges stuff, palisanto smell and of cause a lot of touristy stuff around. Its crowdy with Tourists in the",

          "Interesting market with lots of vendors and people and colors and smells but you may not enjoy the llama fetuses and other disgusting things on display all around. And you quickly realize it's a \"seen one seen all\" kind of place.",
          "Located in the hilly streets above the San Francisco Plaza, these winding, narrow roads offer a large number of arts and crafts shops, aimed specifically at tourists. Also known as the Witches Market, this is a fun place to get some souvenirs or a bite to eat. It can be quite",

          "Pretty crazy part of town with some very strange shops selling all sorts of freaky stuff. It's definitely worth a look but I can't see people buying too much here (unless dried out baby llama corpses are your thing).",
          "It can be a bit scary to see the lama fetus being hanged everywhere. The stuff for local offering may look strange to us. You may also find a lot of handicraft and herbal products here. There are many choices and the price is quite cheap.",
          "Lots to browse and buy along the street of the Mercado de las Brujas. Some really good quality souvenirs - jumpers, bags, jewellery etc. Most of the people along the street are very fair and friendly. Be careful though, there are some that will completely rip you off if you",
          "I was extremely disappointed with this market. Three stores were witch like. The other 200 full of the same stuff.",
          "Really this is nothing to do with witches in the traditional sense but much more a lot with this amazing mix of Inca and catholic imaginary and traditions mixed in an amazing cocktail. You have foetuses of llamas mixed with Virgin Mary's and traditional medicine with coca",
          "We ended up helping the woman use WhatsApp to connect with her son in Brazil. The result was a sweet interaction and she was extra psyched to bless some trinkets for my friends. I also bought some hilarious premise spells for friends.",
          "Great prices for Alpaca products so if you visit Peru hold for good Alpaca sweaters until you get to Witches Market in La Paz. Also a good place for finding Bolivianita jewelry.",
          "Great place to buy exclusive Bolivians weird and normal gifts. From llama fetuses to t-shirts, jewellery, and normal gifts. Definitely worth the visit. And don't ever forget to bargain.",
          "Tourist markets where you can get anything from a genuine alpaca jumper to an alpaca foetus for your witch craft. Worth a visit to practice your bargaining skills!",

          "I've heard a lot about the witches market in La Paz. I made a special effort to go and find it and I walked past it without even realising. It's really not worth your effort or attention. It has a couple of shops selling some baby alpaca foetus', there was nothing interesting",
          "Definitely became a tourist destination with not much witches paraphernalia... it is OK because it is gross anyway.",
          "Regardless of the description, what this is is essentially a row of shops selling pseudo shamanic stuff, handcrafts made in china and the bolivian equivalent of viagra. The ladies that operate the shops are quite pushy and the merchandise is the same. If you find dried up animal",
          "This is basically a handicrafts street like any other in Bolivia, with the exception of one or two shops where they sell strange shamanic artifacts like a sort of mummified baby lama. There are many currency exchange stalls about.",

          "This is a very small market and once you have been in on stall you have seen them all - every one is the same. Different and an interesting walk but nothing especially outstanding, just the same the filled an afternoon.",
          "Not quite what we had expected per other Trip Advisor and guide book statements, but nice non the less. Great place to get your coca leaves, teas and candies to ward off the effects of altitude. Fairly priced goods and friendly vendors.",
          "Amazing place. It is a throbbing, heaving mass of energy. It's impossible to put your foot down and take a step without walking on someone's stuff for sale! Incredible stuff for sale too, aphrodisiacs, lama foetuses ( yes really) all sorts of lotions and potions doing God knows",
          "Really a surreal, but fun safe area. Your one stop dead llama shop. The people were friendly enough and traffic, like all of LaPaz is at best dangerous. I did enjoy it",
          "Felt a bit underwhelming but the things you see there range from the quirky to the ridiculous. Interesting to see and visit for a little while if you have spare time in downtown la paz",

          "The Witches' Market is truly an unusual place. While tourist type trinkets are standard fare, unique and lovely textiles are easily found as well. The hanging baby llamas are a bit disconcerting but interesting as well. So glad we didn't miss this leisurely stroll up the",
          "It is a very interesting place, with many stalls selling magical ingredients. If you need a love poison or just to walk and explore the local peculiarities, this would be the perfect place. I recommend to do it with a local guide who can explain the traditions and rituals behind",
          "The shopping that I could do in Mercado de Las Brujas would be endless. I was amazed how people in Bolivia put coca leaves into everything! From soaps through tea to candy! The colours and the atmosphere of the place was great. Though, I had the impression that in every small",
          "This area was so cool. Tons of hand made trinkets, interesting \"witches\" herbs and remedies, alpaca garments, jewlery, etc.",
          "Great shopping for all sorts of herbs, lotions and potions. Many items I could not identify. The llama fetuses were the least of it. Aromatic herbs, beads, frankincense and other stuff readily available.",
          "Lots of colourfull stuff to buy with quite relaxed atmosphere really touristic though.. Got a nice sweater there",
          "This place is good to see, but there's not a whole lot to the place. Bar the dehydrated llama babies its just normal stalls... Maybe with a few \"witch ingredients\".",
          "So if 'witches' and llama fetuses don't freak u out , this is a quaint must do in La Paz . The stuff in the shops owned by these alleged brujas Or witches is very enthralling and entertaining including 'spell packages ' for tourists to take home and burn like incense for good",
          "I had read about this online and was very excited to go see it but was hugely disappointed. All it is, is a line of shops along a side street in the city. Most of the shops are just standard tourist shops with just a few that offer \"witchy\" goods. It was a real let down.",
          "The items sold here are primarily geared for tourists-postcards, cloth - works, artisania crafts. I did not see any strange things being sold, as one would expect in a \"witch's market\". The prices were a bit higher thsn along the side streets.",

          "Not really a mercado in itself so much as a couple of streets extension of the artisan market streets off Calle Sagarnaga. They sell wooden artifacts, coca products, general souvenirs plus creepy dried and pickled baby llama foetuses. I found it very unsettling and creepy that",

          "I did enjoy so much walking around and felt like a witch in training hahaha...You can see some weird stuff like mummies of the lamas and 'remedies' for all kinds of world problems :) They have some strange specifics which as they claim can help you with love, money, carrier....",
          "Each store has baby lama hanging, but many other stuff seems to make for tourist to buy as souvenir. Also there are many souvenir shop near by!",
          "As I spent nearly two weeks at La Paz, I did visit the market few times, quite turistic area but worth it to see all the herbs,powders,palo santo\",natural remedies etc that the locals used to use and still now, for ceremonies, luck or magic. particular place, where most of the",
          "it is interesting that this marked, with clearly magic background, is to be found next to the church of St. Francis. Christianity and local, old Inca traditions built a fascinating unity. Visiting the market you will find things which have been used for millennia to comfort the",
          "This was one interesting stop. It is full of small shops that provide anything from vitality drinks to love our hate portions. If you are interested in amulets then this is your place. Or maybe you can just peruse as an interesting place.",

          "If you're not visiting the witches market, what else will you do in La Paz ? I agree with other reviewers that it does not meet all the hype, but it is worth strolling for an hour or so. Have a stiff drink after.",
          "This is a street bordered by small stores not maned by witches ( the yatiri shamans are to be found in El alto ) but with a variety of objects used in traditional ceremonies and for regular use The dry Lama fetuses can be found in large amounts but look not at all terrifying",
          "The place is full of tourists, all stores selling the same thing. In order to meet the real world it is necessary to walk the small streets around. The main attraction is dried fetal Yama (why).",
          "Most of all the clothes is imported, nothing is produced in Bolivia. Just Matte de Coca and other stuffs from coca are made in Bolivia. Too expensive price for things that are not worth the money. No one speaks English, and they do not speak Spanish very clearly, numbers you can",
          "Not all that much here. Everything here I've seen elsewhere in a central market like Arequipa or Cusco. Unless you're looking to buy something I wouldn't say it's a must see.",
          "When I was first reading about the Witches Market I was expecting a very mysterious and freaky little part of La Paz. Finally it was really just a few stores that sell normal natural medicine and an over average amount of Lama fetuses that you can find in any other market as",

          "One of the best and more convenient places for your shopping in La Paz, if you are a tourist of course :-)",
          "Definitely worth a visit to the witches market. Really interesting to see all the different medicines and offerings available to the pachamama. Be prepared for the baby llama bodies that are sold as offerings!!",
          "Visited the Witches Market as part of a city walking tour. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting. I'd I knew there'd be llama foetuses (good luck when building a new house). There were all sorts of lotions, potions and votive candles etc which were interesting.",
          "I must say we enjoyed walking the streets here but we found the one in Chiclayo, Peru better. We could get a better sense of the importance of this part of a culture and religion there. Markets are the best place to get a feeling for the life of the people. We always go where",
          "A lot of nonsense is for sale here, from aphrodisiacs to dried llama fetuses which need to be offered when building a house. Nice to walk through but not very impressive.",

          "An interesting collection of stalls lining Santa Cruz street, each of which is filled with various potions, spells, offerings & even llama foetuses. While some stall-holders don\u2019t mind you taking pictures of their goods, my Red Cap Walking Tour guide told us to be mindful of the",
          "The Witches' market is excellent . YES! There are so many shops to choose from with potions, herbs, remedies and concoctions made to suit your desires, wishes, intentions, etc. The fact that lama fetuses are sold as good luck and are clearly visible in the shop fronts is",

          "It's somehow a special feeling to walk by these llama foetus. You just need to know the background of the story to understand why these people sell such things. I would recommend the real witches market in El Alto - way more interesting and not touristy at all! Go there with a",

          "its a fun place to go although a little small in size. some of the stalls will go at length to explain the things they sell, but it helps, of course, to speak spanish!!!",
          "So is probably the number one thing to do. It consists of a few streets and a lot of vendors selling the same wares. I guess we did see the llama fetuses, but one tires at the same stuff over and over again. We did not see any witches. In hindsight we should have bought more,",
          "We did our souvenir shopping here and found great stuff! We got very interesting info about the market on the tour we did with the \"red cap walking tours\" (also here on trip advisor) - really recommendable!",

          "Well, honestly, this market is just a tourist handicrafts market, rather similar to what you get in Cuzco, Machu Pichu, Quito, or other South American counties! If you are looking for a site to buy small souvenirs to your friends, go for it: it's colorful and rich! Don't get",
          "There is no Mercado de las Brujas. Its just some ladies selling stuff like herbs and trinkets that Bolivians believe will help their health and or buying a house, a car, or stuff like that. There is no attraction but they make it sound like there is one to get you to pay a tour",
          "The \"Witches' Market\" of La Paz sprawls over several blocks of one street, Calle de las Brujas. It has something fro everyone - tourist can find both cheap and expensive souvenirs. Locals can find Llama fetuses! eek! Cars drive up and down this very thin alleyway, so watch",
          "It is a fun place to visit. You can find everything you wish and more in these little shops and street vendors. It is a picturesque place with an amazing displays of colors and textures, from spices to jewelry to antiques you find it all here. It is hard not to take photos but",
          "We enjoyed browsing the numerous markets. Vendors were not as pushy as in some places. Bargaining is not so prevalent. It is a comfortable place to shop for gifts and souvenirs.",
          "There are a lot of street vendors as wells as tons of stores. I found most of my souvenirs there (alpaca shawls and blankets). Great place and very convenient for shopping. Most everyone here is willing to barter prices. As touristy as it is, you still get a great authentic",
          "Easy to get to, but it is a small street with few stores compared to other places in South America. Bit of a tourist trap.",
          "I read a few reviews about people totally disturbed by the fetuses and such. They are a bit gross, but they are not in your face. They are definitely there, but the ladies aren't forcing you to look at them. It is there tradition, respect it and move on. I don't speak very good",
          "There are definitely lots of cool things to buy here, and it's right near a neighborhood that's filled with great places to eat and shop, but in a lot of ways it's your typical tourist souvenir market, but with dead llama carcasses hanging from all the stalls.",
          "Near the cathedral San Francisco and the main tourist/handicraft area, this area sells items for traditional ceremonies (like the mesa. While not spectacular and very touristy, it is still a can't miss half and hour in La Paz.",
          "It's a small market (about 3 or 4 stores), but the tradition behind them is what matters. Try speaking to the owners, and you'll find many interesting rituals.",
          "This is absolutely one of the musts when you visit La Paz, Bolivia. It is an incredible market where you will learn about the Aymara traditions on the cult to Mother Earth, see all the types of offerings that are being done, amulets and much more. A definite must when you visit",
          "If you love to look for interesting things, this is the place for you. The street has a great variety of stores and street vendors where you can buy good presents and souvenirs at a very good price.",
          "The area has a huge amount of souvenir shops and certainly you find what you are looking for. The fact that dead animals (or part of it) are for sale is disgusting, as disgusting as going to the butcher. All meat eaters should not have any problems to be at the market. All",
          "The location is within walk of Hotel Rosario and has all the shopping you could hope for we were warned of the dangers of La Paz but never felt in danger at all. There is so much to see from musical instruments ,storage items , Alpaca, old textiles, New trend alpaca designs. all",
          "Great place to buy souvenirs and to see unusual things like llama foetus and magic potions. Some interesting finds and typical merchandise.",
          "It is interesting walking through the street, though not something you need to spend much time doing. the interesting medicinal and religious items are also commonly found in everyday markets, so we weren't very surprised by the brujas market. Howover, this is located in the",
          "Great area to shop for Bolivianite gem other tourist items. Be careful and be aware of pick pockets. Also be very aware of the traffic because they are not aware of you. Traffic in Bolivia is scary but interesting to experience. I wish the tour had allowed more shopping",
          "Once you get there you start reading boxes like \"miracle\" ones, I rather don't point them out here because there will be no interest then to go and visit, just don't be surprised to see crazy things ;)",
          "Central La Paz is a wonderful, vibrant, eclectic place. And part of this is the Witches Market. Bolivia is both deeply religious and superstitious. Which is reflected by the array of items on show. From skulls to smoking devices to numerous replicas of superstitious figures.",
          "Im not sure exactly how this became an \"attraction\" but this is not a market, its just some kiosks on the side of the road. I dont even think there is 10 of them... maybe 6-8ish. This area in La Paz is looked down upon by all locals , and all the Bolivian people in general,",
          "I was looking for a closed place with weird things but it is a street with stores. Mainly there are stores of souvenirs. Just found a few considered for witch.",
          "I had walked around the Sagarnaga street for so much time searching for this \"Mercado de las brujas\" in Spanish. I had asked 5 or 6 units of locals and tourists, each pointing out quite different location and some don't know. Even the tourist map looks inaccurate either.",
          "If you visit San Francisco Church,well then then, Witches a Market is only a 3 minute walk around the corner from there. Don't be too squeamish though!",
          "I was expecting a large market but what this actually is, is a line of stalls on the street (maybe 8 - 10) much as you see everywhere else in La Paz. What makes this different are the products on sale. There is coca leaves and teas, all kinds of herbs, amulets for every",
          "Wander round this safe area and pick up a gift or two - from coco leaves to small carvings. The ladies are helpful. I purchase some ointment and still here to tell the tale.",
          "It is really nice and entertaining. Bring cash to buy souvenirs. Don't make jokes in any language about what you see, it's a different culture and it's necessary to respect it. The witches might help you with any wish you need to come true. Ask around!",
          "You can find all sorts of odd herbal medicine here. I had no idea what any of this was which is probably a good thing as I found the dead llamas disturbing. This place seems very touristy I did not see any locals shopping here. Worth a visit if you are in the area but I",
          "It is actually a very touristy place but the ambiance is really nice. You will find different local handcrafted items at affordable prices.",
          "You will find all kinds of medicin, trinkets and souvenirs. If you haven't had time to buy alpaca clothes, you can do it here too.",
          "The marked was a little disappointing to be honest. Only a few of the shops sold some peculiar things that can be associated with witches. The rest of it was typical tourist things (that you can find anywhere in Bolivia). I still had a good time though, and the marked should",
          "Many tourists, shop owners beckoning for us to enter. Much better markets (admittedly not selling goods quite so unique) elsewhere in La Paz.",
          "This place is horrible! Okay; if you like cheap stuff guess it is great. But there are dead baby llamas and embryos everywhere. Suppose to be a gift to Mother Earth, but i think it is horrible. In every shop, there are about 4 to 8 dead animals hanging there. It is disgusting",
          "Much more expensive then other markets, completely built for tourist. You don't see a local buying nothing there. But don't go to la Paz without visiting it.",
          "A good and safety place to buy a lot of souvenirs, sometimes could be hard to bargain, but walk around, if somebody was not friendly, go to another shop and ask (you won't die if won't try a discount).",
          "The Witches Market is a must see for first-timers to La Paz. You can find quite of variety of things here from touristy souvenirs to bizarre items such a dried llama fetuses. One thing is for sure, this is a very fun and colorful place to visit when you are in La Paz. There",
          "This basically is a shopping street with one \"shaman/witches'\" establishment. It is worth strolling the area if only for the people watching aspects. Prices are generally reasonable, and there is some interesting jewelry. Unless you are an avid shopper, this will not take a",
          "An interesting place to visit, especially you can see the customs of the first Bolivians. Especially the recognition of Mother Earth, for who is offered all these artifacts. It is a mixture of religious and pagan belief for those who want to get an idea of the Andean spirits",
          "You must go there and buy some rare presents and take pictures, the street is not safe but i recomend to take a city tour with an agency",
          "This was on the top of my list for Lima and it was interesting enough with weird and disgusting things on offer but it was far smaller than I had imagined and all the stalls were basically the same. So worth a visit for the interest but don't plan to spend ages there!",
          "Thought it would be more interesting than it really was. The shops are all over the place and besides some 'dried' baby alpaca's nothing crazy is going on.",
          "The witch market is really interesting and offers a lot of weird but funny things to by. As it is in the Center you can do it within little time.",
          "After hearing so much about the Witches Market this was disappointing for me. Yes, there were several shops displaying dead llamas - from fetus (not really sure how small that would be - they were all fully formed, just minature, leading me to wonder if they were real) to 2 feet",
          "Beautiful handmade everything... I bought customer made leather shoes & jackets...so may beautiful things. Haggle haggle. You'll get great prices. Oh wear flats. It's all uphill I advice to start up top & work your way down. A must.",
          "This is a street you will be taken by your guide on your city tour.You can buy local products around here.You can walk for a few minutes around here.",
          "This witches Market or street is quite different. Worth the visit and walk .You will be taken here by the guide in your city tour.",
          "Women at stalls did not know about using catalyst with coca leaves! Not as good as witches market in Lima.",
          "Not sure if it was in full swing as we went on a Sunday. Interesting to see some of the shops, but also conscious that don't want to be there just to look and stare as the locals still believe in these traditions.",
          "Mercado de La Brujas is quite a different market. With lots of bric/brac and things to give you luck, it a place to buy little trinkets that would make you feel better (if you believe in this stuff, but no harm). The lady who sold me the coca tea and anis tea said the that tea",
          "Not really a market as such. A line of shops with some interesting things and trinkets to buy. Stuff you will not see anywhere else like charms to ward away evil spirits, etc. Definitely worth a look if you are in the area.",
          "Lots of crafts here, but an unexpected find were the musical instrument stores. A great place to purchase a guitar or the typical Bolivian charango, not the souvenir type , but the real thing!!!",
          "You'll have a very colorful view of La Paz on these streets. Don't let the name fool you, most of the witch's stuff is just for show. It's worth passing by.",
          "Close to the centre of the town \u0131s the Witches Market where you can buy all sorts of talismans and potions. Several of the buyers were only missing thee costumes but none the less a great attraction",
          "A fun, compact market with things you probably won't find in other markets, like llama fetuses. A good place to go shopping for souvenirs and other trinkets to bring back home.",
          "We didnt walk through the market until late in the evening, but there was a lot of interesting stuff to see. Be warned, getting there involves steep hills. If you are not up for climbing up steep stairs, plan to take a cab and get let off as close as possible.",
          "Be careful not to lose yourself for the entire day here! We set out just to buy a few gifts for family and friends and after haggling prices every few steps we quickly lost most of the day! If you're heading away from the beginning of the market, you cross a road that splits it",
          "Interesting place to visit with some weird items for sale. In the market for llama fetus? This is the place to shop. Need some good luck amulets? Go no further. But we did find a certain sameness after visiting several of the stores. Prices are low and the vendors are not",
          "This market is quite different from anything we have seen, so althought its really just few stalls along the street, I am glad we got the chance to visit. Where else would you be able to see the lama fetuses being sold, right?",
          "A few street of unique shops from traditional herbal remedies to souvenirs to the Witch doctor places. We went into one and the lady in broken English was very engaging and prices were very low. Everything from shrunken alpaca fetus to dried things we did not want to know",
          "If you are in La Paz, do find time to visit the Witches Market. As others have noted, you'll come face to face with llama fetuses which can be a bit unnerving the first time. But to be honest, we found a certain sameness and repetitive feel after visiting several shops. Many",
          "delightful fun, enertaining and interesting. The sight, the sounds, the smells, the experience, it was veery fun",
          "Our guided tour took us to the witches market and I can't say it's my kind of place. I appreciate different traditions but seeing Llama fetus' hung all over the different shops and stalls isn't very nice.",
          "Interesting place. I thought it would be a real market but it's just a lot of shops in two/three parallel streets. You can find VERY different things, Each shop has a Bolivian woman as the owner, they are all very friendly and nice! I took a picture of one of them, she smiled so",
          "Tourist novelty market where you can find actual Bolivian witches selling herbs, ointments, special gemstones, Llama fetuses and all kinds of fascinating trinkets as part of their belief in magic. On Sundays some of the stalls are closed. Worth taking a walk through if you're in",
          "The witche's market is a street including some boutiques where you can buy weird stuff to do magic. It's nice to see and you don't have to plan a lot of time to go there. But it's worth it just to see the dead llamas. It's taking you out of your comfort zone.",
          "A place that could look only for tourist but indeed still used by local people to find all what is necessary for ancient magician rituals.",
          "Great stuff very quircky place but a must to visit, you can walk along the streets and find clothes, jewerly and lot of weird things you will never see in Europe.",
          "I've heard so many people rave about this street and completely understand why! Although the dead animals and abundance of other things make this street a cool stop. This street plays a huge part in the Bolivian culture. Many of the herbs, candies and other items sold are used",
          "There are more tourist shops here than the ones selling the witch stuff. Some of the latter opens late in the day and in the evening. The selection of goods in the witch shops varies from the more curious stuff - like sacred wood to use for offering - to the more obscure and",
          "Walking through a few shops on this street is something that can only be done here. It's helpful to go with a walking tour or read about things first to know what you are seeing. But there a many things in each small shop - llama fetuses, alters, candies for alters, coca,",
          "This is a good place to visit last before you head home from South America. Its souvenirs are by far the cheapest of the Andean countries with plenty of variety. Haggling is OK.",
          "In the shadow of the Catholic church is the mercado de las brujas. Lots of alpaca, woven goods, souvenirs and prices vary. The brujerias, witchcraft shops, are fascinating. Everything from remedies for arthritis or for the lovelorn, to ritual offerings to the pacha mama are for",
          "Tge witchcraft stuff didn't really work that much for me. It's a bit creepy - selling dry lama fetuses next to coca-cola, pringles and lama sweaters. Worth a stroll as you'll probably be accommodated in the area but don't plan on spending too much time on it.",
          "This would be pretty cool if it were set apart from the rest of the street stalls and kiosks in La Paz, but like many other reviewers have said, it's really nothing special and you will easily miss it if you aren't looking closely. The llama fetuses are a little creepy, and some",
          "It's a good place to buy travel gifts. I also went to Uyuni and other places but the prices here were better.",
          "We went to this place after visiting Moon Valley. The shops are pretty identical in terms of the stuff they are selling. If you wish to come and take a look only, don't come on holidays as most of the shops are closed. There are some souvenir shops and cafes nearby.",
          "A few llama fetuses, some dried herbs and cacti on the sidewalk, and a sign above a kiosk were the only distinguishing marks of the Witches' Market from the rest of the many souvenir shops. Nothing interested me and I was on my way in three minutes or so.",
          "Its a good place to go and meet. Its like a big street market with a lot of local store selling clothes and Bolivian souvenirs. Its a free tour and you can buy lot of stuff over there. Usually you can bargain.",
          "this place has changed a lot since i first went in 2008.... there are a lot more ponchos and general tourist tat than before but it doesnt mean you cant still get down to the base roots of the place. you can have your coca leaves read or just sit down and talk about the exotic",
          "Honestly I was kind of unimpressed here. Maybe we weren\u2019t in the main part of it but I felt it was rather small and really the only thing that stood out that made us realize it was the witches market was the dried hanging baby llama fetusus. Outside of that there wasn\u2019t a ton to",
          "I was surprised by the little shops selling everything for good luck or whatever you need help with. There are places where they can read your future on coca leafs. Artisan shops. Enjoyed the visit.",
          "It's only a few stalls and the owners aren't polite at all. It's worth going because they have a handful of strange things, but don't expect to spend longer than 45 minutes looking around.",
          "An exceptional experience - both for believers and non-believers. It says a lot about the culture and heritage of Quechua Indians. Uncommon attraction in the heart of modern metropolis of La Paz.",
          "The mercado de la hechicera, witch market, is not a whole huge market, but only a few stands on the street with esoteric products for health for people who believe in witch craft or homoopathy medicine. Anyways, it's worth a visit to see all the dead lama embryos hanging around",
          "It was a great place to buy weapons of destruction. I found all the things I need to take over the world. Great place overall.",
          "The headline says everything ... nothing really Special there, can skip this for sure if you do not want to buy some crazy bolivian souvenirs which have nothing to do with Bolivia",
          "Yes this is definitely a touristy place. However, if you look carefully beside the funky and really touristy stuff you can find some real gems. We were warned to be careful for pickpockets and other annoyances. However in the 4 days that we spent in La Paz, before leaving for",
          "Thirty years ago this was an interesting market. Now it is a pathetic tourist draw for anyone interested in kitch.",
          "I looked at the street signs and looked at the map again, but I still wasn't sure I was in the right place. Mercado makes me think of a big market, but the place marked on the map as \"Mercado de las Brujas\" was only a couple stores selling mostly incense and charms.",
          "Seeing the various dried animals was not my taste and there is definitely a touristy feel to the area. It really isn't much different than the rest of the area around Sagarnaga, but you might as well experience it while you are in the area.",
          "our hotel was just in this area so we have had the chance to pass through this market several times. suggestive and mysterious",
          "This is one touristy place for sure. Beware of pickpockets as review mention that this place was not so safe at all. Most of the shops sell identical stuff. Its good to walk around and take a look, ask for price before purchasing. Difficult to bargain whenever fancy. Sell werid",
          "Unlike anywhere else. Great fun, lots to look at and all sorts of souvenirs (if you want to take them home!) that you could imagine. Lots of places to get an excellent hot chocolate.",
          "You'll see things that you have no idea could be sold. Some is just down right disgusting like dead animals but it is interesting and provides for a fun afternoon. There are potions, dead frogs, powders for good luck, fertility. The dried lama fetus are maybe too much but it is",
          "Such a fun place to walk through. You can purchase really weird things such as mummified baby llamas and various herbs. I felt safe walking through at night. I would recommend against bringing a stroller/wheelchair. The roads are uneven and broken throughout this street.",
          "Ok, so once you get over the llama fetus this basically is yet another tourist market, but very quiet the day we went. Sales staff not that happy, collectively!",
          "It was great to be there but maybe we;ve been to a lot of places like this already! It;s good experience though!",
          "Most of the reviews for the Witches Market are under \"Calle Sagarnaga\". This is definitely a great experience and a must! It has all the old culture from Bolivia along with the tourist shops!",
          "1. don't miss the graffiti on the walls. They can be very beautiful. 2. it felt safe walking during the day. 3. uphill walk can sometimes be tiring if you had just stepped off the plane",
          "Went there hoping to find some interesting items. Place was packed with locsls.i really stood out and like a fool I stayed. Felt something tickle top of my head and when I looked up they grabbed my passport from my pocket. Avoid any crowded place in Bolivia crime rate is",
          "Do you want a ring, a hammock, a t-shirt, some trousers, some lotions or potions? it's all here if you have the time to root around. It is very close to the main street and there are enough different stalls to while away a couple of hours. It might be best if you have a clear",
          "Interesting to visit. But even better if a local can explain what all the dead baby animals, potions, stones & Artifac are for. Otherwise it is hard to get a good understanding/gauge.",
          "Anyone going to La Paz should try to see the witches market. It is an unusual place that makes it interesting. Weird, colorful display of voodoo stuff for sale from anything to charm a lover or cure a serious ailment. Whatever your heart desires is here.....as long as you",
          "I was expecting more as I'd heard so much about the markets. They're strewn along the streets where traffic still drives past, rather than in a big segregated area, so is very crowded and a bit crazy. The stalls themselves are great, everything you'd ever want to buy and some",
          "- Lets just say I have never been to a market just like this one! Despite the high altitude in this country, i truly enjoyed walking around market. Everything you can find here are pretty much sovenirs but there are some shops that sell really weird and wonderful things that",
          "The witches market is on Melchor Jimenez, a little off Linares, behind San Francisco Church. It is a fascinating place to wander. Some of the things on sale look a bit gruesome and animal lovers may get a bit upset. The most popular item for sale is Llama foetuses. They are",
          "I liked the proximity of Witches market to La Casona Boutique Hotel - It's mostly one street with shops and outside street stalls selling unusual wares. Good to visit.",
          "My rating is based on the fact that I hate shopping, especially when things look the same from one store to the next. That said, if you are interested in seeing some creepy things like Llama fetuses (naturally aborted fetuses) which are used as ceremonial sacrifices for some of",
          "Is amazing, u can find everytingh, and la bolivianita is the best store there, people is friendly and you learn a lot of bolivian culture, and it is ok if you want to take pictures",

          "Coco leaves, llama fetuses, potions, etc. an interesting place to spend an hour or two. Thought that the llama fetuses would be an interesting piece but definitely didnt want to encourage or support that market.",
          "It\u2019s not really much of a spectacle\u2026 just more shops and street stalls, but if you look closely you will find some unusual pieces, presumably used in the making of spells. Llama foetuses are also on display in many of the shops and stalls (see my photos). Potions and drugs are",
          "Whether you are looking for typical handicrafts or original solutions for different ailments, this is the place to go! Remember that prices are not holy here, and don't hesitate to negotiate, especially if you are buying more than one item.",
          "Not as big as I thought it would be but still large considering you've got some very steep roads at high altitude to navigate. You can buy a cure for anything in the world and see some strange stuff like lamas heads for sale. A must see in La Paz.",
          "if you really want to explore any of those interesting markets in Bolivia, you need days... so many things you have never seen there, and so little time. you better speak spanish!",
          "Is a bit hectic but fun, and u an find pretty much whatever u need to good prices, all it takes is patians and time. Even if u dont want to bye anything it still a pretty fun place to just walk trough.",
          "We came here expecting a lot more market stalls than what there was. There was only about 3 shops/stalls open on the day selling traditional potions, etc and a couple selling the typical touristy stuff. Don't wait to buy all your take home gifts from here as you will go fairly",
          "I expected more from this attraction. I have visited far more interesting markets selling 'potions' elsewhere in the world, especially in Africa. The llama foetuses are interesting, but there is not much else. It is generally similar to markets and stalls in nearby streets in La",
          "While I didn't have a problem with the witches market, it wasn't as cool as the guidebooks had made it sound. It was actually pretty small - only a couple of places along one street. The street is in a touristy area near lots of hostels, so it was convenient to get to. I would",
          "Stroll up hill from the San Francisco Church a few streets and the shops that just sell hats, jewellery and jumpers to tourists but witches goodies like the llama foetuses as well. It probably won't take more than 15 minutes to take it all in. Shop keepers are a bit grumpy as",
          "Unless you are looking for a musical instrument, or just want to satiate your curiosity as to what shrivelled llama foetuses and Aymara amulets look like, this so called tourist attraction is really overrated. In fact, along the length of the street, there are only a few shops",
          "The so called Witches Market is made up of a couple of stalls on a street in the old part of town. There are no witches in sight and I would not have bothered or realized it is the \"Witches Market\" if the tour guide had not pointed it out.",
          "Yes, there are more Gringos here than Bolivians but it is a fascinating place and in my opinion a must to visit when in La Paz. Great area to buy presents to take home and there are also some very good quality artisan items if you search for them, often off the main street, in",
          "Yes, this is the place to come for little souvenirs. There are all manner of little trinkets designed for tourists. Some interesting things, and some not so much. And likewise, you will see plenty of tourists walking down the market street.. But, it's not all bad. It also",
          "We stayed at the hostel: La Posada de La Abuela Abdulia in the middle of the witches market. Frankly I am glad that we stayed in this area because La Paz doesn't have a lot of nightlife going on and out of all the places we visited in the city there were always a few bars open",
          "The famous La Paz Witches\u2019 Market was a 15 minute walk from our hotel, The Rosario. For fans of the macabre the market sells a bizarre assortment of goods, including dried llama foetus which, if buried under the entrance to a home, brings the occupier good luck. A tempting",
          "Fairly near the bus station and near the major hostels so likely that you will come across it staying in La Paz. The market is full of tat for gringos but at either end go and see the crazy ladies with Llama foetuses (people bury them under their house for good luck)."

          "the Mirador is right in the middle of the city. I loved, that it's very peaceful here, so you can escape hectic La Paz for a moment. Also, not too much people where there. But you have to do a exhausting walk up there.",
          "It is the place where Tupak Katari (indigenous leader) directed the siege to the city of La Paz in the fight for the liberation of the Spanish yoke in the year of 1781.",
          "Friends told us it was great so we took a taxi out AND.... this is a great place to take panoramic photos of La Pax. Wide angle is best. You might also take them from the telef\u00e9rico. Killi Killi is often crowded",
          "good view of the city and nice place to sit or take pctures. only reason not 5 stars is we walked there and its a bit of a hoof for basically as good a view as you can get from the mi teleferico...",
          "If you're into sunsets and city views that is the place to be. Very accessible (taxi from centre 10BS, walk 15mins from Plaza del Armas) and offering 360 degree view of La Paz. Worth it!",
          "This place is simple and a great view of La Paz . It is great for photos and has places to sit and relax .",
          "Mirador Killi Killi, named after the bird of prey that roamed this area is the most prominent vantage point above La Paz, the highest capital city in the world and already 3.65 kilometres above sea level. So, it\u2019s high, very high. Take the bus, taxi or walk if you dare. The",
          "Mirador Killi Killi has the most amazing views of La Paz!!! It is amazing watching the Sunset from there.",
          "The mirador is a really nice place to go to if you want to admire the lights of the city at night. As always in Bolivia, be careful when travelling by night. If you don't have a car, I would recommend you to take a taxi. The place is probably also.woth going to during the day,",
          "We had a guide and driver so it easy to get to the viewpoint. You have to deal with some steps but it was easy. There is one guy selling stone carvings. yes, there are bathrooms but you have to pay.",
          "It\u2019s a nice view for sure but it\u2019s painful to get up here in traffic . I would personally stick to the cable cars for the views from the top. The red line for example gets you right to the edge and you can get out and take a look at the scene there",
          "Went up just before sunset and had the most beautiful 360 view of the city. Slightly difficult to reach as we tried walking the first day but ended up going back to our hostel when we realized that we wouldn't make it up the stairs due to the altitude. Went by taxi the next day",
          "Although Mi Teleferico is replacing viewpoints in La Paz, Killi Killi is still a lovely viewpoint in which to relax & enjoy the wonder that is this unique city.",

          "Starts on a tough uphill walk ( you can touch the road by putting your hand out in front of you) but the views at the top are worth the walk up!",
          "It is a really great place, especially at nights; it is like seeing a sky with many stars above the same sky. It is really easy to get there, just take the Bus at The Obelisco Square with a sign written with \"Villa Pabon\". Finally, I think is a really good place to take photo,",
          "From here in pretty much all directions (may be except for one likely to the north) are just \"breathtaking views\": those of the city below (with some great-looking clusters of like 20-to-30-storied high-rises) and those of the surrounding mountains beyond the city (including the",

          "Killi Killi is in the top of a central hill, where you can see both canyons of the forming city of La Paz, descending from the Andes Royal Range. The place is a bit left, with not an easy access, but worth doing it",

          "From this point, you get a 270-degree view of La Paz settled in the valley surrounded by mountains. A good spot for artists as well as a tourist photographer.",
          "Take about 3-4 hours and walk up to the Mirador Killi Killi . It was quite a walk but worth it . When you get to the top you have a birds eye view 360 degrees of the entire La Paz city , Illimani and other mountains . I suggest taking a picnic up there or a book and relaxing .",
          "Nothing like a good lookout to know geographically how the city works. The view of this viewpoint is splendid.",
          "Best view of the city - free entrance. Take a taxi and tell them to wait (not many taxis there) The view is absolutely stunning.",
          "Made the trek up here and was rewarded with fantastic photographs. Small park to entertain the kids while we gazed at the views.",
          "Just a short walk fro the main area. It is wordless the view . A nice slice of la Paz around you . Worth it",
          "Great spot to go and take pictures, go at sunset. Free to get in, taxi cost hardly anything or ride the cable cars.",
          "I climbed up on feet - it's quite steep! Once you are on top, you have a great view of the valley of La Paz up to El Alto. The mirador itself is nothing special. It's gardens are nice, there is a lot of 'basura' thrown down from the mirador - as everywhere in the city. It is a",
          "In these days you will see much more by taking the Telef\u00e9rico, but the place is still worth visiting as it is just a short walk away from the touristic center of town.",

          "You can easily do that by walking from the CBD. Nice lookout with view over the whole la paz. Do it during the night to see all city lights",
          "It's great to see all of La Paz from this vantage point. So many buildings crammed into this city. The colours were really nice and seeing it in the evening with all the twinkling lights was magical.",

          "Definitely a challenging climb up steep streets if you choose to walk there like I did, but worth the effort for the best views of the city. Full 360 view with the picturesque snow-capped mountains in the background. Don\u2019t leave La Paz without visiting!",
          "We walked like it is typicall for La Paz...up, up and down, and up but it is definitly worth it. The view is fantastic and you can get an imagine how big und crowded the city is. And it is for free.",
          "You don\u2019t need a long time at Killi Killi but make it at sunset. Amazing 360 degree views of the city.",
          "Yes you can catch the cable cars and see the city but this was much more satisfying! Amazing 360 views when you reach the top completely out of breath... well worth it! But not for anyone having issues with altitude... very steep to get up the last bit, but you could always",
          "Since Mi Teleferico offers some of the best views of La Paz from all possible sides, this Mirador lost its position as the best location to see the downtown La Paz. This is still a fantastic location with little tourist. If you are up for a little ( max 20 min) hike you will be",
          "We took a taxi to the top of Mirador Killi Killi as it would be quite a hike otherwise. Our taxi driver was happy to wait at the top and allowed us 20+ minutes to take photos. The views from the top are absolutely worth the trip!",
          "The view point is very beautiful, allowing you to see the city of La Paz from above and the mountains around it",
          "We had a nice time at the view point. I would be aware of your surroundings. We did not have any problems but a few travelers we met did.",
          "Beautiful views all around! Not much to do downtown La Paz hence we suggest you to go climb those stairs. Those houses built on mountains look fantastic from the mirador.",
          "Well worth a trip to Mirador Killi Killi for beautiful panoramic views over the city of La Paz, including an aerial view of the highest national football stadium in the world!",
          "Excellent look-out point for views in many directions of the canyon city, la Paz. On a clear day you can see for many kilometers. Near the street entrance there are public toilets - a small fee is charged for use.",
          "Walked up from Sopocachi district in 25 minutes, but would take most almost twice that. A little confusing to find but map and friendly locals helped. Liberates people - while I was there, four Japanese girls were up on the wall dancing to Spanish music while they're friend",
          "the most amazing and breathtaking views from la paz make sure you go for the sunset and moonrise and take jacket",
          "Quick free destination to see the city with a 360 degree view. Great place for pictures. Taxi up as roads are steep",
          "come to see the city from above. check opening times too. we spent 15 minutes admiring the views from this park.",
          "This spot is well worth your time to get to. The taxi drivers all know how to get there and it gives you a great view of the whole valley from the main plaza to the view of Illimani.",
          "It's a hilltop in the middle of La Paz, easily walkable from downtown. I watched the sunset on New Year's Eve (2017) here and it was beautiful. Lots of couples here taking walks, and local children play in the small playground near the entrance. The arch structure makes for",
          "Ten minute walk from San Francisco church, great location to take pictures of the city, beautiful sunset.",
          "just a must do, the you will understand a little about la paz location, geography, etc. almost 270 view. clean, easy to reach by car. interesting.",
          "This is a great place to really have a good look at La Paz. From this point you can view the entire city and the snow capped mountains in the distance.",
          "If walking around the city pop this on your route, the panoramic views are great and definitely worth a quick visit. It\u2019s up a steep hill (as most good vantage points are) but worth it.",
          "Stunning views of the surrounding area and most of La Paz with lots of seating to take a rest.Truly a great photo opportunity as well!",
          "My hostel was located only 15 minutes away from this viewpoint, but the view at the top made the upward walk worth it! Gorgeous place to see La Paz from a height.",
          "La Paz is the world's highest altitude city at 3600m average but flat on the centre and with mountains up to 4000m and the bottom down to 3000m You can see it all from here - the highs and lows.",
          "Killi killi lookout was the last stop on our private tour in Bolivia The view from the top was spectacular 360 degrees of la Paz city. We were very pleased we went to kill killi !!!",
          "It is quite an effort uphill, be warned. Seeing the city up high is great but the best part was the mountains, both the snow covered peaks if it's not too cloudy and the beautiful red hills just beyond the city",
          "UNIVERSE! Beautiful view, awesome feeling! We own the world and its in front of us! Amazing! One you are there, you feel this ENERGY!",
          "The only place I went to in La Paz that allowed me to take in the sheer vastness and beauty of this city. The light at night emitted like veins and corridors connecting the city together. Very memorable experience. Maybe not the safest at night for the weary. It can be",
          "This place offers an amazing view of the city and it is very fast to get in there using the Teleferico.",
          "Taking a taxi to the top of the hill and then walking up the stairs is the way to go if you want to visit. The views are unusually good from many different angles and it's great for taking pictures. La Paz is a gorgeous city surrounded by mountains. Bring your camera! There",
          "Quite a great escape from busy La Paz! But you are well advices to take a cap or Bus up the hill since it can be quite a hard walk due to the altitude. There is a clean public bathroom right in front and the entrance to the mirador is free of charge. It can be quite cold when",
          "There are a few spots around La Paz that overlook the city centre and thus offer amazing views, but Mirador Killi Killi definitely has the most sweeping vista to see. Might be an idea to take a taxi up to the viewpoint if you have any mobility challenges as the approaching",
          "About a 30 minute uphill walk from the centre, the mirador is worth a visit if just to put your altitude adjustment to the test! The views of la paz, el alto and illimani are worth the hike up",
          "If you want a fantastic view of La Paz, this is almost the best lookout point in the city. In particular, come here for the sunset.",
          "Visited early July 2017 as part of a city tour solely for me. Fortunately, despite it being winter, the weather was bright and sunny and so I was able to take photos of the vista from all angles. Ten minutes is long enough.",
          "Awesome circular views of the city and the snow topped mountains. Safe area. Taxi's are cheap. Do not miss it.",
          "Fantastic views. Take your time, to take it all in. A guide told me it got its name because an eagle had a nest there when they went to build the lookout, and the noise that's made when they grab their prey sounds like \"killi killi\".",
          "I have lived my whole life in La Paz and didn't know it existed. But since then I can't stop going in the morning for a good coffee and landscape, afternoon for relaxing or just sunset for admiring! If you visit La Paz, make sure you go this wonderful place, has almost 360\u00b0 of",
          "Great 1st day in La Paz activity to test our acclimatization skills. Short distance from main action but feels worlds away. Love the view and great photo ops!",
          "What a beautiful and queit spot with stunning views. Also good for a short hang out from the bustling city environment. Surpisingly only a few people there and we felt safe (been there during the day). It's also a good opportunity to stroll through up there even it's a bit",
          "Being La Paz set in a valley surrounded by mountains, the best way to see the city is from above and El mirador Killy Killy is easy accessible and have views to the most important landmarks in the city. I don't rate La Paz that much but it is a good way to orientate yourself and",
          "It's quite the 'hike' up to the top of La Paz, but the views of the city and Illimani are incredible. The area at the top has several tiers and there is a nice man that creates some hand-carved stone figurines who hangs out there regularly. It was the best location to see the",
          "Beutiful views of La Paz. It's centrally located so you can get there for the quick pictures and keep exploring.",
          "With almost 360 degree view of the city. Its crazy how many people live in this town. It explains the bad traffic. Its free and a good stopping spot for pictures",
          "A MUST in La Paz!! One of the best lookout in the city. U can see whole city from a platform. 20 minut walk from St. Francis church.",
          "Awesome spot to take in all the city. You can see the whole valley with the Illimani at the back. Be sure to make this stop part of your visit to the city!",
          "We walked from Plaza Murillo to there, was around 30 minutes, slow walk, keep going up till Avenida Sucre, then up following the direction on the map. It offers a good view of the city, if is a sunny day you will get great pictures. If you have a map it will be easy to get there.",
          "It's quite easy to get there with a micro (also the cheapest option), great views of the extended city and the city centre, and a very pleasant walk down hill towards the centre. Go to shoot some pictures and get a drink and enjoy the view.",
          "We originally planned to go to Mirador Laikakota, but that seemed poorly maintained and not that great. So we went to killi killi around the corner instead. Incredible views and a great platform! A must when in La paz!",
          "The Mirador Killi Killi is easy to be reach by taxi and offers a unique view of the city. Also the panorama photos taken there are amazing. Young people still can climb by foot, but seniors should take a taxi driver, who knows where is the mirador...I choose the wrong one, but",
          "20 minute ride out of the center, you can walk up if your in good condicion. Nice spot, but look out for faulse guides and picpockets",
          "If you are passing by, it's worth a quick little walk to check out the views. Don't worry if ya miss it though.",
          "One can reach this high lookout point in La Paz by various means of transport but getting there by foot is a pleasant challenge. Recommended though after a few days in the city. Beautiful views in all directions but in particular when the Illimani is seen",
          "This mirador offers unobstructed views of La Paz and also some decent bathroom facilities. It's in the shape of a semi-circle, which will enchant selfie aficionados.",
          "A very peaceful place, with great views. It's a hike to the top, but well worth it. Or catch a cab ;)",
          "It's a lot of fun to take a cable car with the locals to see La Paz from the altitude of 4000 m but the best panoramic view opens from the Mirador Killi Killi. Advantages: no queues to get on a cable car. You can walk to the place or to take a taxi. Bear in mind that the last",
          "Great location to view this mountainous city. Not to miss. We arrive at sunset and must be a perfect time to see the city in shades.",
          "I simply walked from the old historical center to the mirador, such a great walk, and such a breathtaking view. and it's free!!!!",
          "Wonderful views at a decent little park. It's a tough walk up, but actually pretty fun because you see a typical neighborhood and the views along the way.",
          "The mountain has spectacular views of the modern city with its mountainous backdrop. Good for a birds eye view of la paz. Highly recommended.",
          "We did it the easy way and we got to Killi Killi by car, at the beginning of our tour of the city. La Paz is located like in a cup, with the city center at the bottom of a cup and then houses that seem to be getting up on the mountains surrounding on all sides. From Killi Killi",
          "Loved this little viewing point located a ways from the city center. Worth a trip if you have an hour or so to burn. The most interesting way to get here is on foot but a taxi is a bit easier.",
          "Killi Killi is right in the middle of the city. Excellent for taking pictures, early morning or sunsets. You can have almost 360\u00ba views of La Paz. You can walk up the hill, but it's better to take any public transportation.",
          "That's ok to walk a little to have a different view from La Paz. You can walk to this place taking around 20 minutes by foot from the Iglesia de San Francisco.",
          "You have the most amazing view of the city and can take great pictures! And on the way there you can see the city and the life of Bolivians with their interesting and differnt shops and groceries...",
          "Nice place to go. We walk from Plaza Mayor (marcado lanza), it's not very far but it's a uphill walk, so if you are in good shape, it's not a problem to walk there, or take the taxi (it's cheap)",
          "It doesn't look like much from down below but hike up or take a taxi and you will be glad you did. You will see the valleys of LaPaz and get a much better sense of the city layout and size.",
          "The views are very nice and the locations of Killi Killi its more center in the city. Great to take a lot of pictures and have a better idea of the city and the Alto.",
          "Good short trip located somewhat close to La Paz\u00b4 center. Take a bus up there because there is no footpath and it is real steep. One has a great overview over the lengthy city shape and the surrounding mountains. It is for free, too ;)",
          "This lookout was just a short walk from my hotel, mind you it was uphill a lot, but you get used to hills when you are in Boliva, don't you? It was in a safe neighbourhood and free to enter and take photographs.",
          "Although we enjoyed the beautiful views from the lookout point, it was difficult to ignore the many stray dogs that inhabit the area and the strong urine smells from those who mistake the area as a public urinal. This is not a spot to enjoy a picnic lunch. We recommend taking a",
          "From central (for instance the catedral) it's only a 25 minute walk or less, and the hill is quite short, so no real need to take a taxi like most suggest unless you don't like walking and have a hotel / hostal in sopocachi or something. It's a nice view, and good for if you",
          "I walked from sopocachi my third day in La Paz. Things in the valley can appear deceptively close on maps, so remember the hills. If you're not acostumed to the altitude, take a cab as this is quite the hike. However, great 360 degree views of the city that left me more",
          "we visited Mirador Killi Killi as part of the city bus tour, the guide was friendly and pointed out points of interest. The views from this point are priceless and a must see!",
          "We visited this lookout on a city tour and it gives a view across most of the old city. Well worth the stop.",
          "It was one of the stops of our city tour.The view of the city is magnificent, there are benches where you can sit and admire the scenery. Wear good walking shoes, sunscreen, hat and bring along a camera to take with you unforgettable memories.A must visit place in La Paz.",
          "We stopped off as part of a morning tour and was definitely worth a look with stunning views across La Paz. As the story goes this is where the indigenous fought off 10,000 attacking spaniards back in the day. Great view of the football stadium as well.",
          "After driving to many small places and looking at different sights, it is best to take a breather and pause to enjoy the view of the city. Love how I was able to just sit, look and admire how lucky I am to be blessed to visit Bolivia. Love to see how the city comes together. Not",
          "A great place to go and enjoy a picnic lunch (tienda's nearby will sell snacks and sodas) We recommend getting a nice take out lunch from the City Centre and spending an hour at Killi Killi enjoying the unparalleled views and photo opportunities. Remember to bring a blanket,",
          "Since we were some of the lucky few, the altitude didn't affect us much. So the small set of stairs you need to walk to the top weren't that bad. Mirador Killi Killi is easily accessible by taxi, and is free of charge to visit! At the top, there was a mariachi band playing and",
          "The walk to this place is a little steep, but definitely worth the effort to get one of the best views of the city. With the mountain in the background, this place is simply wonderful.",
          "One of my favorite places to have a landscape look of La Paz. I've taken different travelers and all enjoy the views. It is easy for me to show them where are the main things or buildings. Just make sure to go during day time as night can get a bit shady.",
          "It's very easy to get there, either walking or by public transportation. A peaceful place with an amazing view. Good for taking pictures or just to sit and relax.",
          "At first I didn't really want to climb all the way up, but I had some free time so I did. And I'm truly glad for that because this view is breathtaking. Even better than the Teleferico!",
          "For just a small walk you are overly rewarded by the view. It's s no brainer really. It's stupid to go to la Paz and not climb up to see the view from here. Absolutely amazing!",
          "Stunning panoramic views of the city. Well worth the steep walk up there. Not much else going on so only need to allow an hour or so.",
          "Of course, you should be extremely careful to go to Mirador Killi Killi at night, however, it gives you a awesome night view of the city of La Paz. It looks like so many stars fallen to the earth around the mirador.. I recommend that you should talk with a taxi driver for the",
          ".... but this City offers tremendous views from many different places and although I enjoyed the Mirador, when I stepped on the teleferique I was taken apart from the magical views.",
          "You can see how big La Paz really is. Go when the sunrises or sets to het the best pictures of La Paz. If you go at night be aware of the couples.",
          "The city is extremely crowded with traffic stopped up all around the emission is so strong and along with the altitude you wonder why so many live here. The view is good but overwhelming",
          "Went as a part of an 11 day tour. Great lookout over La Paz, gives great perspective over the hectic pace of street level.",
          "The lookout point and view is incredible, but if you have young children the park in this location is a must-see attraction. ITs very big with many sections for both young and older children. best park in La Paz",
          "Don't miss this view point. You'll get a 360\u00b0 view of the city and great pictures. After taking pictures from El Alto, this is a must see. Take a micro from Calle Yanacocha and Comercio to \"Villa Pab\u00f3n\" and ask the driver to take you to Mirador Killi Killi.",
          "Pretty sight, but dangerous if a woman goes alone as me, the persons follow you and one spends a very ugly moment, in this zone they steal from him very much the tourists.",
          "Killi Killi offers a nice view of the central area of La Paz, but I prefer the cable car. It's also a nice stroll back to the central area from here.",
          "With the sun at your back, a morning time visit to this scenic lookout is worth the time. I took a cab up to the entrance from the Hotel Rosario and spent a half-hour framing various shots with my camera. A walk down the hill to Plaza Murillo and Calle Jaen made for a nice",
          "Killa Killi viewpoint (kestrels) is a good spot for great photos overlooking La Paz. You not only get the city spread out below you, but you have good terrain and mountain shots as well. You can also take photos of La Paz's fascinating aerial gondola \"subway\" that leads from",

          "If you come here at sunset, you might end with some good timelapses of the city. The view is quite nice and wide. The downside is that at night the neighborhood is not really welcoming.",
          "Well worth the trouble. The view of La Paz is great. I took a few panoramas and they have come out well. The 360* view of the city shows how big it is.",
          "It had a nice view of Valle de Luna (Valley of the Moon) and better picture taking opportunity than the Teleferico. If you're in the area and have a couple dollars to spare on a taxi ride up, then it's worth a visit. Otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way for this.",

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country.

Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times.

In March 2012, more than 1.5 million vehicles were registered. Heavy traffic is common in the city center and traffic jams occur on peak hours.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nThe La Paz-El Alto Highway is a toll road that connects the city of La Paz with the neighboring city of El Alto. It is the city's main highway. It allows easy access to El Alto International Airport. The highway runs 11,7 km and crosses the city of El Alto:\n\n Autopista La Paz-El Alto/RN-3 (La Paz-El Alto Highway) - Connects La Paz with El Alto.\n Autov\u00eda La Paz Oruro/A-1 (La Paz-Oruro Highway)  - Connects La Paz with the cities of Oruro, Patacamaya and Caracollo. It then connects with Ruta Nacional 1/RN-1 (National Highway 1) heading south to the cities of Potos\u00ed, Camargo, Tarija.The Southern District, one of La Paz's most affluent and commercial neighborhoods, is relatively separated from the rest of the city, including the CBD. The Avenida Costanera and Avenida Kantutani (Costanera and Kantutani Avenues) connect the southern district with the rest of the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nEl Alto International Airport (IATA code: LPB) is La Paz's national and international airport and a principal hub for L\u00ednea A\u00e9rea Amaszonas and Transporte A\u00e9reo Militar. It also serves as a focus city for Boliviana de Aviaci\u00f3n, Bolivia's flag-carrier and largest airline. The airport is located in the city of El Alto and is (13 km) south-west of La Paz's city center. At an elevation of 4,061 metres (13,323 feet), it is the highest international airport and fifth highest commercial airport in the world. The runway has a length of 4,000 metres (2.5 mi). It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport.\nInternational carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca, LATAM Airlines and Peruvian Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, Santiago and Cusco. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft.\nAirport facilities include ATMs, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, car rentals, duty-free shops, and free Wi-Fi internet. Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines.\nThere are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country. In the year 1964 was a bad year, and it lost the category, playing the next year in the second category, but returning afterwards.The Strongest : Founded in 1908 the club hosts some of its games and trains on their home stadium named Rafael Mendoza after Don Rafael Mendoza, one of the most important presidents of the club. In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts that allowed the team to rise again as one of the most important in the country.\n\nLa Paz F.C. : Founded in 1989, the club quickly rose through the ranks to become the third major club in the capital, only behind in popularity to the two well-established city rivals.The city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:\n\nAcademia de Balompi\u00e9 Boliviano\nAlways Ready\nChaco Petrolero\nClub 31 de Octubre\nDeportivo Municipal de La Paz\nFraternidad Tigres\nMariscal Braun\nUniversitario de La Paz\nClub Uni\u00f3n MaestranzaWith the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Uni\u00f3n Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the Estadio Hernando Siles, which also hosts the national football team and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times. The palace has been restored many times since, but the name has remained untouched.\n\n\n=== Principal attractions ===\n\n\n==== Museums and cultural centers ====\n\nThe former home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, martyr of the independence revolution of 1809, has been preserved and is now a museum.

In March 2012, more than 1.5 million vehicles were registered. Heavy traffic is common in the city center and traffic jams occur on peak hours.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nThe La Paz-El Alto Highway is a toll road that connects the city of La Paz with the neighboring city of El Alto. It is the city's main highway. It allows easy access to El Alto International Airport. The highway runs 11,7 km and crosses the city of El Alto:\n\n Autopista La Paz-El Alto/RN-3 (La Paz-El Alto Highway) - Connects La Paz with El Alto.\n Autov\u00eda La Paz Oruro/A-1 (La Paz-Oruro Highway)  - Connects La Paz with the cities of Oruro, Patacamaya and Caracollo. It then connects with Ruta Nacional 1/RN-1 (National Highway 1) heading south to the cities of Potos\u00ed, Camargo, Tarija.The Southern District, one of La Paz's most affluent and commercial neighborhoods, is relatively separated from the rest of the city, including the CBD. The Avenida Costanera and Avenida Kantutani (Costanera and Kantutani Avenues) connect the southern district with the rest of the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nEl Alto International Airport (IATA code: LPB) is La Paz's national and international airport and a principal hub for L\u00ednea A\u00e9rea Amaszonas and Transporte A\u00e9reo Militar. It also serves as a focus city for Boliviana de Aviaci\u00f3n, Bolivia's flag-carrier and largest airline. The airport is located in the city of El Alto and is (13 km) south-west of La Paz's city center. At an elevation of 4,061 metres (13,323 feet), it is the highest international airport and fifth highest commercial airport in the world. The runway has a length of 4,000 metres (2.5 mi). It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport.\nInternational carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca, LATAM Airlines and Peruvian Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, Santiago and Cusco. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft.\nAirport facilities include ATMs, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, car rentals, duty-free shops, and free Wi-Fi internet. Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines.\nThere are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

          "This street is indicative of a past of the city. It is beautifull and makes onthink back to times that have gone by.",
          "Such a contrast to most of central LaPaz, this beautiful street seems to invite you to wander down it's length and explore. Lot's of little nooks and great spots for photos. Cool cafes too for stopping a while and taking int he scene.",
          "Several interesting small museums and art galleries are on this short street. Definitely worth the time to wander into them all. Well, most of them.",
          "Beautiful street in the city centre, not so long but it has different museums, some crafts stores and restaurants or coffee places, so if go there you will be visiting the site about two hours and a half (museums included) Architecture is well conservated. Great place to",
          "If you have been to other cities in South America with a colonial city centre then you could possibly skip this one. I did not because you never what you are going to find and this one was remarkably pleasant.",
          "Went here as part of an organised full day tour with Transturin. It is one of the only what I would call traditional historic streets left in La Paz, the buildings are beautiful and colourful the street is cobbled and on a small incline. If in La Paz visit here. There are a",
          "One of the nicest (if not the nicest) streets in La Paz. Small street with some shops, museum and some history.",
          "A neat little backsteet thathas no traffic and do not underestimate that as a huge attraction in this city. The Museum of musical instruments is first class, there are a number of restaurants and small shops but its not spectacular in a tourist sense",
          "Beautiful pedestrian street full of museums, shops, and one hipster cafe/wine bar. Too bad it was just so short...",
          "just dont miss it. though we were late for museum visit , a stroll through Jaen Street ( tough to pronounce - there is no \"J\". Calm and beutiful , architecture ..colourful. night must be more romantic. Had coffee from the coffee house just next to museum. very sweet -place",

          "If you're in La Paz, it is certainly worth visiting Jaen Street, a well preserved and good looking relic of La Paz's colonial past. It is quite narrow and very quaint.",
          "enough museums to keep mesuem hollicks occupied for the day, from instruments to art, to precious metals. Good cafes too.",
          "This street is short and narrow with cute facades on colourful buildings. Worth a look and to take a few pictures but I wouldn't go out of the way to find it.",
          "We walked up to Jaen St having been told that it was a good place to go to. Jaen St is quaint with original buildings. The museums however were not well laid out and the house was restricted to two rooms. I would not recommend it as a site to see in La Paz except to wander down",
          "I stayed in a hostel on this street so it was a short hop to 4 small museums that this area is known for. Note the lovely cobblestone/rock detail on this little winding lane.",
          "Worth exploring the area, many museums and galleries. Nice artisan types of shop but beware they are closed on Sat afternoon and Sunday. There some interesting colonial architecture.",
          "This street has so much history. You can go to four government run museums for a small fee: The House of Murillo (the man who started the revolution against the Spaniards), the Museum of Precious Metals, the Litoral Museum (military/history of the access to the sea), and the",
          "Calle Jaen is not very long, but it was very pretty and there were plenty of beautiful colors up and down the street. It's a great spot to take pictures, and there are also a few museums, tour agencies, art galleries, and cafes along the way to stop at. We made the walk up the",

          "The cobblestone street had several colourful houses, which made it nicer than the usual streets in La Paz. However, the entire street was very short (perhaps 100m?) and there were just several artisan shops and one cafe open in the late afternoon. Not quite worth going out of",

          "It's a cobbled street with small artisan shops n museums. The museums do shut at about 5pm. A few interesting art shops but unfortunately, i didnt see something which is really Bolivian that I can buy as a souvenir to bring back to the UK. I guess it's worth a visit/walk to this",
          "Nice cobbled street to walk through and back. I missed the hustle and the vendors like in Linares and Sagarnatha area.",
          "This rather narrow, short, cobbled street is a must see in La Paz. It gets a bit crowded with tourists, but the colours, the architectural detail and the four museums along the route are all worth seeing. Plus there are artsy shops and places to eat. The museums are closed",
          "An awesome colonial street, still keeps its original house facades, and stone road. Now has museums, bars, touristics shops; Even many people says that this place is haunted, cause has a green cross on one of his walls... And believe me, the best absent on the city...",
          "In my opinion this is the best Colonial street in La Paz. It is peatonal and it has a lot of very pretty colourful houses with the added value that national hero Murillo lived there. Good stroll, good cafes, nice place",
          "Beautiful street with nice museums. The architecture is a lot nicer than in the rest of La Paz and it's close to the center.",
          "My most favourite place whole in La Paz! There is a museum telling you a history of La Paz and also a little cozy cafe by the museum (my favourite!) You shouldn't miss out this place I swear!",

          "Ja\u00e9n Street offers a look at old La Paz that does not exist any more. A narrow street with well preserved old houses that have become museums and coffee shops. A pleasant stroll either with a group or on your own",
          "This is one of the few streets in La Paz that have maintained their colonial touch. The street is narrow, with balconies from different houses facing one another. They are almost close enough for neighbours to shake hands or share apples (by tossing them over, of course). The",
          "The street is quite short but you can wander into the art galleries and there are shops and restaurants nearby. It's well preserved and photogenic. You'll see some tour groups being led down here but it is also used by the locals.",
          "I had a business trip in la paz so I tried to know some places..this street is like magic you can find a lot of museums.. stores to bye souvenirs you can see a lot of tourists.. And near also some bars that are beautiful not just typical bars..so if you want something different",
          "Great place! There are six museums in one place and great pics can be taken here. You can hear about some good stories here.",
          "Honestly, we did not like La Paz, but this little street is nice. Cobblestoned and colonial style, it is peaceful and beautiful. Probably overrated in the brochures, but nice to spend a relaxing walk through.",
          "It is included in every travel book or on many city maps. But this street is under average and has not much to offer, a bit boring.",
          "Different look and feel from the test of La Paz. The tour company for the walking tour is here. They say this place is haunted. There's a green cross on one end of the street to ward off spirits. Apparently this street is known to ghost hunters.",
          "Nice cobble stone street lined with colourful colonial buildings housing nice shops. Very much worth walking through.",
          "It's a nice, narrow, cobble stone little street where time seems to have stopped sometime ago. Nothing spectacular, just a taste of the past and worthy of a little stroll ...",
          "Quiet small street so worth walking too. It's nice to get out of the major crowds of LaPaz and this was a pleasant place to do that.",

          "This is a nice little street, there is a 3 or 4 museum. Little shop. It's very quiet. There is a park not to far to relax",
          "There are many streets in La Paz and this is one of them. It is nice and if you are going down it, enjoy, but don't cross town just to come here.",
          "We stayed on a hostel on this street and I would highly recommend it. There were lots of really cute eateries but I didn't visit the museums.",
          "Not as colourful or cool as I was expecting. There are quite a few museums but they didn't excite us too much. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to go there, but it's not like you'd be too disappointed going there",
          "Many of the museums are on this street. The lane itself is quaint, peaceful, and a great stroll from shop to shop (arts and crafts, arts galleries, craftman's Shops etc.)",
          "Cute little street with a hostel and some tour agencies and museums. Not necessarily a tourist attraction in itself, but nice if you want to see the museum of musical instruents",
          "Its just a street to walk up, that has been kept in its original condition but will give you an idea of the architecture of centuries gone by.",
          "Visiting the Jaen Street museums was a delight. The system is well organized: one ticket allows a visit to several of the museums. Some, but not all of the museums had information in other than Spanish.",
          "as the other reviewers say, it is a cute but very short street. It only has a handful of shops and a couple of nice coffee shops but other than that it is just a street. my advice is pop along if you are nearby but don't go out of your way to find it",
          "Nice little street with small stones embedded into the roads and the buildings still in great condition. Not a must do if your time is limited",
          "This is only colonial street in good shape remaining in La Paz. So it is a very special and charming block. Over the years, what used to be just regular houses, is being transformed into touristy shops. Still it has that charm. Full of legends and you can visit at least 5",
          "this is a very charming street to visit and it contains three important museums to be visited: the Musical Instruments' Museum, the Litoral Museum, the Murillo House Museum, and the Metals' Museu.",

          "The street itself is quite charming but the main attractions are the museums. There are four museums near the top of the street which must be bought as a package: Museo de Metales Preciosos, Museo del Litoral, Casa de Murilla, and Museo Costumbrista Juan de Vargas. At the bottom",
          "Soner or later most La Paz visitors walk along Jaen Street. And so should you. The architecture is very interesting--lots of balconies. The shops are plentiful as are the art galleries. People watching is always a good past time, and Jen Street is a good place for it.",
          "This street has lots of interesting architecture and artist shops to visit as you walk along this street. I bought a little carved painted box that was made by a local artist and it is one of my favorite souvenirs!",
          "before the spanish colonists build the city on 1548, there was the lama market. Now you find nice shops where young bolivian artist sell there handicrafts. It change from the shops of the calle Sagarnaga",

          "Jaen street is a nice, just nice street. Walking in the street is quite lovely, nothing spectacular about it but different from the other streets in La Paz. You can take nice pictures in some part of the street.",
          "To be honest this street is a bit overrated I think. We took a photo but outside of that its just a street with a bit of colour. If you really appreciate things like this I'd suggest valparaiso in chile. As for the musuems we specifically wanted to visit them but we had to",
          "Quaint colonial street that houses several museums , although we were there at the posted opening hours, two of which were closed, so rather disappointing.",
          "Very historic street in La Paz that is hard to appreciate without the knowledge of a good guide. Many tours walk through this street which is an important location to the history of the city.",
          "with such a rich colonial and republican past, shouldn't this not only be a street but a whole district? is is so small, the musea so unattractive and it is at the top of every tour guide i see, i very much prefer the natural outdoors things in la paz",
          "If we had only few hours in La Paz, this is the street I would want to see again. Narrow lovely street with several museums, very well preserved buildings, with typical southamerican balconies, clean, unassuming... Next time would try to stay in the only accommodation on this",
          "A stunning multi-coloured surprise in the middle of an unpromising area. Some nice little artesan shops as well.",
          "A very lovely street in La Paz, the most colonial example in La Paz and is a very tranquil and beautiful street.",
          "This is a very unique little street, very neat and pretty but I'll be honest I much prefer the more interesting streets that criss cross the area of the witches market. La Paz for me was one of the most interesting cities in S. America.",
          "The street itself is quite charming - but it's short and can be done in a few minutes if you're not planning on visiting any of the museums. We had hoped for a decent bar to have a drink, but there was nothing but one dark looking pizza place with plastic chairs there (at least",
          "Arriving mid morning, this historic street was deserted, but bcame busier as midday neared. The museums were interestingbut with no English translations for displays we were left to figure out for ourselves what many artefacts were. The tiny entrance fee meant this really wasn't",
          "I had high hopes for Jaen Street after reading so much about it being one of the few preserved colonial streets. It is quite cute with cobbled streets and older preserved buildings. It is also home to several small museums at are very popular and interesting. But the",
          "It's a really cute place to visit while in La Paz. It gives you an idea how the city looked like some 150 years ago. Just stroll down and enjoy. It won't take you long though. Worth visiting.",

          "- You will chance upon this street when wandering around the streets of La Paz. - Very pretty alley street with many colors. - Yes, this is a good spot for photos. And trust me, you will not be disappointed because your photos will turn out really clear from the high altitude.",
          "We spent 3 weeks in La Paz, so we pretty much saw everything touristy that you could imagine there, despite the fact that about 5 or 6 days of our stay we were bedridden and my wife was hospitalized for gastroenteritis (message me if you want medical emergency advice for La",
          "We stayed on this street in excellent Hostal Ananay, which was the saving grace. But otherwise it's a set of unremarkable museums - which we didn't feel would have been improved by some more English language or less surly staff. It featured some of the worst art and sculpture",
          "Quaint street but nothing special, full of tedious, dull museums, the street is just like anyother, no idea why it got as many postive reviews.",
          "five museums including the music instrument museum. several little shops selluing artisanat and / or organic quinoa. Sevaral little bars and hostels. Very quiet since it is a pedestrian zone",
          "Cafes, museums, old architecture, and plenty of charm. This is a delightful place to stroll with no cars. Be sure to look in on the museum of the Pacific.",
          "Jaen has some really hip shops and cafes. Definitely a cool place to hang out and relax. Nice art galleries.",
          "This beautiful area and street shows La Paz as it was 100 years ago. It is very authentic with several meusems and old houses. Very nice to visit for a couple of hours",
          "Don Pedro Domingo Murillo who headed the revolution of 1809, his house is now a museum...and there are 3 or 4 close by museums...it.s worth to walk ..lil .hard to find but is very close to San Francisco plaza",
          "This street is probably one of the best looking streets in La Paz, we went at midday and were the only ones there. There are museums to visit, and I imagine the street comes alive to those with a guide and more information. Worth a look if you are staying nearby. There are some",
          "Our group did enjoy this this shot and narrow street that provided historical 19th century feel. Street takes you to excellent ethnic museum and nearby plaza.",
          "This is a must visit in La Paz. The Jaen Street is full of museums worth visiting and is a great activity for a nice day in La Paz. I wouldn't go with small children since there aren't many things for them to do (only the Musical Instruments Museum would be suitable for kids)",
          "The Calle Jaen is a small cobbled street a short walk (15 minutes approx) away from Plaza Murrillo. Worth it....very well restored buildings which have tasteful little shops at the bottom opening up onto the windy cobble stoned lane. At the top of the lane there are a number of",
          "Not sure I would make a huge effort to visit. Perhaps we timed it wrong as it was very quiet (Monday lunchtime) with a lot of the shops/museums being closed. Yes, it is quiet and cobbled and quaint but I was expecting a lot more.",
          "It's a very special little street, very different from other areas of the city... I recommend that you go during the afternoon and ask around for the stories of the street.",
          "Nice example of what La Paz use to look like in terms of architecture and cobble streets. The street has some great little art galleries - at reasonable prices. Great spot for a cup of tea or coffee!",
          "the street is what we imagine La Paz was 70 years ago..the museums are great and the cute little stores and cafes around will make a great half a day visit",
          "Worth the trip if for no other reason than being the oldest street. However, it's also very charming, with the intricate balconies being my favorite. Several museums are clustered in the area, and the gallery/shop of Mamani Mamani is close by. I would recommend stopping by",
          "A surprising beautiful restored street that is worth a visit. A lot of museums and small shops, and the best, no traffic!",
          "Short and iconic colonial street in old La Paz historic district. Alost each house over the street is a Museum, some of them as good as the Musical Instruments Museum that charango master musician Ernesto Cavour has build over the years, single-handed and just because of his",
          "A bit of a walk for such a short street. Not sure I would recommend going although the shops seemed nice and the museums (although shut when we arrived) sound quirky.",
          "Granted, I was usually coming around during the evenings, but surprised to find everything closed, except once one bar was open and the guys were friendly. Should be a hip little street as written up in guidebooks but personally I found it to be dead and disappointing.",
          "Calle Jaen is a short cobblestone street about four blocks from Plaza Murillo. The colonial era houses have been fully restored and house museums, shops and restaurants. Try Etno for lunch or dinner.",
          "Beautiful street, that deserves a visit. Very interesting the Mamani Mamani Art Gallery. Amazing work of the artist that involves the Andean Cosmovision.",
          "For some reason this street is on every \"must-do\" list for La Paz, but for me, (not a HUGE museum guy), it was just your average narrow street in La Paz. I did visit a couple of the museums, such as the museum of Bolivian musical instruments, and grabbed a coffee at Etno",
          "representing historic la paz... museums, restaurants and caf\u00e9 / wine bars -- a great distraction for an afternoon!!",
          "Picturesque and touristy like Montmartre in Paris. Not quite our cup of tea. The museums in the street are cute but nothing to call home about.",
          "Perhaps there are hidden historic dimensions to this area that I was not aware of, but although pleasant to stroll the cobbled streets, unless you like wandering into small not too gripping \"museums\" there is not too much to hold your attention. But, that said , it makes a calm",
          "We saw this street, briefly when we went to visit the Musical Instrument Museum (also highly interesting!)... amazing what a coat of paint and a 'make-over' can do to a place/street/village/hotel/Restaurant/home anywhere!!!!!!!!!!!",
          "I visited on a Sunday so not much was open but it's a gorgeous, clean street that still maintains the classic buidlings from the 19th century. The museums there are nice but not great though they don't cost much. It's a must see in La Paz for cultural purposes.",
          "Situated between the bus station and the San Francisco Cathedral, it is easy to walk to. It is an old colonial street with several museums--especially the musical instrument museum where, if you are very lucky, you may meet Ernesto Cavour, the legendary charango player who",
          "it was nice to walk up and down but we we went early in the morning and late in the afternoon (to check out a coffee shop we'd seen) but everything was shut both times. Get a tour with Banjo Tours and they'll explain a little about it. Mornings are better to visit because",
          "As reported by other reviewers, all musea were closed end December/early January. Without the musea the street has nothing special: many colonial towns have nicer streets. If you also visit Cuzco don't waste time here.",
          "Increable, all musea are closed for at least one month! This will not help the tourism in thia country. Although the street by it self is very nice and well restored, closing these musea is a complete failure..",
          "Calle Jaen - a street in La Paz. The only impressiv - the cleanness. You can see the old stone mosaics on the street with out the waste in the rest of the city.",
          "For La Paz, the short Spanish-era street is unique, with its lacey iron balconies. However, let's face it, you would not give it a second look in Europe or elsewhere in Latin America. Still it's very nice if you are in the neighbourhood. It would have been GREAT if the museums",
          "A good visit if you have some time left. There are 4 small museums, that you can visit with 1 cheap ticket (10 boliviano's). One of the museums is closed for the moment. Especially the house of Murillo is worthwhile. Photo's are forbidden.",
          "Delightful short pedestrian street with colonial architecture, 5 small museums, and art galleries. However, two of the museums ( the Metals or Oro (gold) museum and the musical instruments museum ) were closed for several months, but its difficult to find this out beforehand.",
          "Quaint little street above the city center. There are five museums located along the street, along with a few shops and cafes. The problem with it is that the four city-run museums keep odd and very short hours - generally opening for just a couple of hours in the morning and",
          "Great to see that the Bolivian government can beautify at least some small part of their city. It may only take 5 minutes to amble down (or up) this street, but it is great to see this restored old colonial street. Their are several cafes and craft shops along its length to add",
          "I went to this street, and it is a lovely street with many interesting museums which are open in the morning, then close, and then open again at 3:00 pm. Unfortunately, we hit the street around 1:00 pm. We walked down the street, and shopped. I especially enjoyed the gallery at",
          "Gold, metal, music, art and others are represented in these museums. One of the most interesting is the building that was once the home of don Pedro Domingo Murillo, a leader in the La Paz Revolution of July 16, 1809, with its displays of period furniture and paintings.",
          "This is a narrow, historic, cobbled street where there is a group of small museums run by the La Paz Municipality. It is very attractive and photogenic with several shops selling artisania. You can buy the entry ticket for the museums in the one on the main road and then visit",
          "This street has colorful colonial buildings with balconies. There are also several museums here which we were unable to visit. The street itself is an attractive enough reminder of a bygone era, just don't expect to be bowled over.",
          "It's so bad that the colonial area in La Paz is pretty much limited to Calle Jaen. The buildings are beautiful, and the area really quite, with nice stores and cafes.",
          "This street is beautiful! We were there on a holiday, so almost nothing was open on the street, but that was almost better. We had the street to ourselves! It looks so picturesque, so beautiful. It's worth going to Jaen Street just to walk down it and see the architecture. What",
          "The well-preserved, quaint, stoned road is a welcome surprise if coming from the big, crowded, noisy boulevards and street markets of the rest of La Paz. At the lower end of the road is an elders' home with sweet folks sitting in the sun and feeding pigeons. The colors of the",
          "Okay so the 4 museums were closed (easter sunday) but we popped in the the muscial instrument museum which was fun to have a go on some of the instruments. We took a few pictures and found a nice art gallery at the end. So some might say not a lot to do but it was a little",
          "Only 3 of the 4 small museums were open when we visited (the gold and silver museum was closed), but it was still fun. The street is lovely with all the charm of the 18th centery. The buildings that the museums are set in were beautiful. The displays looked great, but we had no",
          "Oldest street in town that still looks like the 18th century. Lots of fun pubs like Etno and Boca y Sapo to enjoy the evening. Plus all the museums that concentrate around that area. Really worth a while visiting.",
          "Colorful, from past colonial times. Nice short walk. Would not recommend walking around at night though.",
          "This street is exactly what I was expecting in La Paz. It is small and quaint with some nice souvenir shops. I didn't visit the museums as I had gone quite late in the afternoon. Ended up buying a nice small bag made by an indigenous tribe.",
          "Sure it is not going to take up a whole day, but this is a lovely street to have a coffee, visit a couple of the cute museums and buy some gifts. It was by far my favourite street in La Paz!",
          "The historical concept is nice and there is novelty in some of the products, but this gathering of stores feels just like another photo shoot opportunity and the chance to buy some bizarre products. Each staff seems to carry the same stuff.",
          "4 museums for a ridiculously low price. Each museum is very small, and the exhibitions aren't that interesting. To make things worse, we paid for all 4 museums, even though one of them was closed for renovations. On top of that, in only one museum the explanations were provided",
          "Excellent place to pick up gifts and souvenirs. The Mamani Mamani studio is located at the end of the street. Well worth the trip.",
          "Very pretty street! The four museums there are quite interesting (and cheap to get into) but there really are minuscule. 90 minutes for all four is plenty!",
          "A cool alley way filled with cute stores and a few great museums. Check out the museum of instruments!! Very interesting!! Good way to fill an hour or so.",
          "Unless you are heading to one of the museums on the street there's no point going. Cafes are small darks dn overpriced.",
          "a great place to gomfor a drink or a delicious meal. we ate the best pizza in bolivia. dont miss that while in la paz.",
          "Make sure you save an hour or so to hit this street! Cool architecture, nice shops! Worth an hour or so!",
          "Take a stroll away from the hustle and bustle of the La Paz streets and enjoy the beautiful feel of the cobbled back roads where the mothers hurry along with their children and the locals walking about or sitting outside their homes. We stopped to buy ice cream from a tiny shop",

The views of the city are beautiful but it seems like there\u2019s a nursery at the top and it\u2019s gated. Felt a bit awkward edging round about 30 kids to sneak a peak",

          "I'm not a big church-goer; more of an art and history buff. But I did enjoy my visit to this chuch and the grounds within. My volunteer(?) guide really helped the appreciation of the building and its history. We explored a few hidden nooks and crannies and even went up on the",
          "The entry fee of 20 BOB is worth it. We had an informative guide take us through the museum, explaining the history of the Cathedral, paintings & St Francis along the way. The cloisters , garden & rooms we visited were very interesting & we got to go up onto the roof of the",
          "A much visit attraction in La Paz. Such a beautiful church. The gilded alter is everything you would expect from a church this old. But please remember when you visit that it is a living and breathing church. Lots of Bolivians use it every day to pray. to see their display",
          "Beautiful architectural monument. As you enter the building you will feel its grandeur and its unique peace that is so missed by many modern churches today.",
          "A little difficult to walk round as I was there when there was a service on. Pars of the Cathedral are highly decorative and rather baroque in style. I always feel that these are too grand for the needs of religion. The glory of the church not a place for worship. Lovely facade",
          "Discovered I could not only explore this beautiful Cathedral, but I could actually climb to the bell tower at the top. Not for the fainthearted. The stone staircase is narrow and winding. You can only explore being escorted by a guide provided once inside. Also you must leave",
          "Cool looking church, busy plaza in front, and a great mercado building right next to it where there are multiple stories of all kinds of stalls",
          "This church, later called a small basilica was first built in 1581, damaged by 1612 and rebuilt by 1753 to be the impressive edifice that it is today. The founder of the church, Francisco de los Angeles Morales has his remains entombed here. The fa\u00e7ade has intricate carvings of",
          "This is well worth a visit and I recommend a tour. The structure is fascinating as is the history of this residence. The roof tiles are incredible. Shaped on the thighs of the men working on the roof. Quite amazing.",
          "It's a really impressive church. If you get a tour you'll appreciate it a lot more. If you get the chance go to the top of the bell tower for amazing views of the city",
          "The church is nice and relatively big. It is located in the centre of La Paz, easily reachable on foot. Note that you are not allowed to take pictures inside, like in most churches in Bolivia.",
          "I really wanted to visit this church and was certainly not disappointed. We went to visit the museum and considered not when we had to pay admission. What a great decision to continue. We didn't really get it- but we were assigned a guide who spoke English- who took us on a very",
          "We visited the Church and the attached Museum last month .We found the Museum was good value and very interesting around the history of the Franciscan Order in Bolivia .Our local guide was very informative and keen to explain how they played a part in the development of the",
          "The exterior really is the main show here ... It\u2019s pretty bland (for a Catholic Church!) inside but worth sticking your nose in. Some of the side alters are clearly very popular with locals ... adorned in flowers and people queuing to pray.",
          "This church and the history are amazing (and I'm not usually a huge church person when traveling). the tour was very cheap, and you get to know the history of the church and some of La Paz, and get to go on the roof for amazing views. I highly recommend taking the tour!",
          "A beautiful old church with an always busy square artists, vendors, comedians, travelers, locals... everyone. Interesting place to relax with some fresh popcorn or coconut water while you take in the sites, sounds and smells of La Paz.",
          "The collection itself boasts some rather interesting examples of religious painting, but you don\u2019t really get to enjoy them as the museum\u2019s administration is ridiculously overprotective. Not only you are not allowed to take photos with or without flash (which I can totally",
          "This beautiful church is the heart of La Paz, and inside you can find many treasures that tell the story of the Pace\u00f1os and how the religiosas dirt intruded by the Spaniards... there is a cool story how they used mirrors to trap the souls of the natives... The facade is also a",

          "Even if you are not inside the structure and the history about it, is something that you can not forget from inside is so quiet and the smell of old church is unreal, the people preying and getting some spiritual connection is something that it's not so common to find. Special",

          "This will be a quick review. This place is only good for pictures. They have Some spots that make for good pictures. The cost is and very much about 20 Bolivianos or about 3 US dollars. I\u2019ve taken the tour three times because I had some visitors that wanted to see it. The guides",
          "Nothing spectacular compared to some south American cathedrals or churches but still another good example",

          "Five days in and around town. We did not have time to get into the church and / or the museum. We only saw the church from outside and all of its sculptures indigenous and not so sacred, we loved it.",
          "The church is situated at the San Francisco Square, which is usually full of people, so be careful. The church itself is worth a visit, although it is quite lugubrious inside.",
          "Now we avoid this square. Crowded, filthy, hard to walk on sidewalks because of the many vendor, and pick pockets. The food and stuff being sold is disgustingly dirty. Garbage is simply tossed on the street.",
          "Another one of those ridiculous relics of the spanish invasion and suppression of a strong group of cultures. That aside, the building isamarelof constructin and architectural skills and definitely worth a visit.",
          "Went here as part of an organised full day tour with Transturin. Beautiful Spanish style church in the middle of a very busy part of town. Lots of beautiful paintings inside. Worth a visit if in La Paz",
          "It was a good place for some history about Bolivia and the construction of the most beautiful Church that I visited in Bolivia. The best part it's to feel the cold air around the back. The sad part is that we couldn't took some pictures of this beautiful place.",
          "There is no charge just walk in. The church is extremely ornate with golden altars and paintings and statuary everywhere. It is a basilica and is, I believe, the oldest church in La Paz dating back to the middle of the 16th centuries. Founded by the Franciscan order. Next",
          "The entrance fee is 15bs with a private guided tour (mandatory). The guide we had didn\u2019t speak good enough English for us to understand the places and keep rushing us to the next spot. The museum and the church has quite a few different rooms and art gallery with brief",
          "Really nice place. We paid 15bs and the guide was included. We got a lot of informations and felt comfortable with our authentic and nice guide.",
          "This old church is a solid addition to the spirit of La Paz. While the outside is not especially compelling, the inside is highly ornate with many intricate golden carvings around pictures of holy persons. There was a mass in progress while I was there and I was impressed by the",
          "Very nice inside architecture, also nice facade with a mix of indigenos and conqueror symbols. A bit tricky to visit on a Sunday as there are a lot of services. Even, worth to sit in, have a quite moment and look around the paintings, the gold foil decorated ornaments.",
          "It's worth it to come in and see the church while it's open. Very pretty and huge. It's only open during Mass, so entering and sitting quietly recommend",
          "Before going in the church we took a tour of the adjoining monastery. This was most interesting and very informative. We were shown models of the monastery both before and after alterations that cut the size of one of the quadrangle. You have to go on a tour to access the",
          "This iconic church is a place of refuge from a crowded square in front of it. The wall-to-wall main altar is a riot of gold with an assortment of uniquely Bolivian santos. The church also boasts La Paz's best rooftop view which is only accessible if you buy a ticket to the",
          "The architecture of this church is very interesting in that it combined religious Catholic statues alongside indigenous symbols. For a small charge you can walk up to the top of the bell tower for a great view of the city.",
          "This was the starting point of our walking tour. The outside is more impressive than the interior. 10 mins inside was more than enough time to look round.",
          "Nice and interesting for a short visit. Not so different from many other churches nd cathedrals in South America. Visit if within walking distance or a short cab ride, but not worth a long trip just to visit this place.",
          "Interesting church to have a look at. It is useful to get a guide to help you understand and appreciate some of the intricacies and stories behind the building, as well as how the religious developed. Follow my #30somethinggapyear on Instagram @DatLoongJourney.",
          "When you visit a foreign city, particularly like somewhere in Central or South America, there are a certain number of buildings to see - palaces, government buildings, cathedrals, etc. This is one of those in La Paz. St Francis seems to be a popular saint in this neck of the",
          "Although you don't get to stand in the actual sanctuary, you do see a lot of the church and the surrounding buildings. Don't miss a visit to the bell tower and roof, if you don't mind narrow passageways.",
          "The truth is difficult to contemplate in its entirety. The structure is made of stone and its history is worth remembering. If you are wearing a hat",
          "Entry ticket included a guide, however you might get a uni student whose English is not very fluent. Interesting history of the cathedral and Franciscan monks. Worth climbing up the steep narrow staircase to the bell towers that offers nice view of surrounding and interesting",
          "My husband and I visited the museum attached to the church as our first stop in La Paz. I can't remember the cost, but I know it was low. The rooms in the convent contained paintings and historical information (all in Spanish). There was no one to offer a tour in English,",
          "well worth a stroll through to see the beautiful main and side altars. Was reverent and respectful as Mass was being celebrated. Obviously not as opulent as the churches and cathedrals in Europe.",
          "We've taken an English tour of the church. The lady is an extremely experienced one who can manage to show us all important features of the church in a 40 minutes tour. However, the tour is a bit too short and we think it should take 1.5 hour to finish reading all those",
          "The museum offers many rooms with detailed explanations of the history of the building & the Spanish influence in La Paz.",
          "An artistic and architectural jewel. Incredible structure in the city. Good memories in adjacent stores.",
          "Is one of the the principal churches in lapaz and a really enjoyed the place the museum is great! With guides, nice place to go for small history.",
          "Originally founded in 1548 as the Convent of San Francisco followed by the church in 1549. Rebuilt in the mid 1750s the current baroque mestizo style church still stands and is a minor basilica. For a reasonable entrance fee, I received an individualized and comprehensive tour",
          "The Church is beautiful, but when we went on a tour (20 b) we didn\u2019t learn anything due to a stressed guide. But if you\u2019re happy with just the interior- go!",
          "Very interesting temple, outside amazing figure ( people , dragons animals , plants) old door , baroque style. Inside simply with many altars on the right and left sides. Photo - prohibited .",
          "When we purchased tickets the staff said there would be English guide available, but when we walked up the stairs to start the tour, the staff there said there won't be any English guide. We walked by ourselves for a while until we bumped into a group of German tourists being",
          "Sadly no photos but this building is very different to the cathedral which is mord in European style. The altar is gold replica. A huge full wall. There are statues and paintings in the native style and as our guide indicated represents a polytheistic belief system totally",
          "This is well worth a visit, it has a lovely peaceful atmosphere and is a beautiful building. Shame about the hideous tower blocks all around it.",
          "We visited Iglesias de San Francisco and were in absolute awe. Very well preserved and full of historic items thoughtful displayed. It was like a walk back through time. We would highly recommend visiting this Historic Site in La Paz. Well worth the time and money spent. Easy to",
          "When I arrived at the church, early afternoon, I was told it was not open to the public until 6:00 PM. However, the church museum was open and admission is cheap. I was accompanied by an English speaking guide (although her command of English was rather rudimentary). I climbed",
          "Very old rustic church, absolutely breathtaking on the inside well worth a visit. The day we visited it was decorated with hundreds of flowers!",
          "I\u2019m not catholic, but I can appreciate all the fantastic structures they have built and this one is impressive. Be warned, you are not supposed to take pictures inside . . . Oops! I didn\u2019t see the sign until we were on our way out.",
          "We passed by on the Saturday but it was closed only the museum was open, we did pass by again on Sunday and we were able to catch a mass which was very touching The church itself was very pretty.",
          "Watch for pickpockets, but it is an interesting structure to visit. Lots of people congregate in the general area.",
          "The outside is a reminder of Spanish colonialism and the architecture exquisite. It's not opulent like what I saw in Italy but it's massive and simple in structure. Inside it's a very much a daily practicing church where local devotees spend much time. Very very cool. It's",
          "The church is not as impressive as its counterpart in Lima, but the tours provide great insights and take you up the bell tower. The guide we had spoke french, and was very knowledgeable. It is even amazing to see that there are still monks living there",
          "We went for the Sunday mass, goes on every hour 7:00 to 11:00 AM. Unfortunately the guides only works Monday to Saturday, we will like to know more about the history. Even with aren't in too a mass worth the visit to see the Spanish conquers power.",
          "It's a toss up as to whether the cathedral of the San Francisco church is the more stunning highlight of La Paz. The SF church is more accessible in terms of opening times, but photography is completely forbidden inside. The architecture isn't as impressive as the cathedral, but",
          "Visting the church after 1600 is free and one can take a leisurely look around the stunning interior bearing in mind that photographs are strictly prohibited. The craftsmanship and dedication that has created the carvings and facade are staggeringly good. To view the monastery",
          "This is arguably the most famous Plaza in La Paz. It's nice, but not impressive when compared to many of the famous plazas of the world. I certainly would not go out of my way to visit this place. But if you're in La Paz and have some free time, it's probably worth stopping",
          "Once you enter to the Musuem you start to like it, the guide was very nice and helpfull!!! The paintings are beautiful!!!",
          "The tour is good, and they have tour guides that do it in English. A tour of about 30 minutes. A little expensive bit worth it if you don't mind being bossed around for that length of time.",
          "If you're staying near the church of San Francisco this is a good place to plan your day after breakfast while people watching.",
          "I usually don't go to churches but I was there with my father and, beside he goes to church, we needed a place to rest! Lol We got there at the end of the Sunday worship and it was nice. They had a choir and people were singing and actively participating. I was raised as",
          "Went in to church on a Sunday as it was the only day it was open while I was in town, managed to attend mass which was interesting in itself",
          "The church is beautiful and worth a visit. The city square there is very popular. The mime clown is fun, as well as the Michael Jackson impersonator. Lots of actives and vendors. Great area.",
          "You can't miss this church; it is the epicenter of the city. Lots of people and activity. Church is unique example of baroque mestizo style.",
          "Nice old church that seemed to be the center of local activity. There are lots of vendors in the area",
          "Unusual church blending the county's cultural traditions both inside and out but especially on the fa\u00e7ade. If not to everyone's taste, full of interest and well worth a brief visit.",
          "We enjoyed an English speaking guided tour through this incredibly historical building and got a nice view of the main square. The tour takes you through tight stairways and if you're lucky, to the script. Fantastic way to spend an hour.",
          "Good way to spend about hour our guide juan alegandro made the tour very interesting and was free as part of the entry fee worth a visit",
          "The Church can be visited by simply entering it, when it is open, but the adjacent museum enables the visitor to see its Franciscan Convent as well as the Bell Tower and various other nooks of the complex. The Mestizo Baroque architecture is of special interest",
          "We really enjoyed this tour of the cathedral. The church is very old and since it was built clergy have lived here (still do). There and a few rooms where you really sense how it might have been to live here 300 years ago - and how oppressive the colonial morality was. We had",
          "The building is a real gem. My only complaint is that you can only wander around as part of a guided tour, and our guide pushed us through at a brisk pace. I would have liked to take more time. I presume the tour is due to the meandering nature of the building. Parts are closed",
          "The church is beautiful inside and out, it was very touching to be there during a mass and hear the voices raised in song filling the space, I'd go back to lion around more as I didn't like to during worship. The museum however is a disappointment - it costs 20bol to get in, a",
          "The english guide on the museum.. Oh dear lord! Well, he didn't speak good English, I didn't mind that but he was so scared and embarrassed about that so he practically ran the place through and on the way just pointed up the objects and said a few words about them. The",
          "The museum and the church are definitely worth a visit. The church is not accesible at all times of the day but if it's open it's worth a visit to see the beautiful altar and have a look at the crypts.",
          "Located at the crossing of Sagarnaga and Murillo streets, in the back of the plaza with the same name, Iglesia de San Francisco is perhaps the oldest in the country. Construction started in 1548, before the founding of the city of La Paz, it then collapsed in 1612 and built",
          "Well worth the visit. It's a beautiful church measuring up to those in Europe. The detailing on both the interior and exterior is incredible",
          "Make your way here and then head off up the many laneways and explore the old City . The Church has lots of activity outside as well as the usual views inside",
          "The architrcture is a combination of european and indiginous...so it is a beautiful unique church...no doubt But whats more excited are activities at the front...such as chess tables and street concert",
          "One of the Most Important buildings in La Paz and a unique architecture and facade-decoration! Note the floral motives and the inca-faces there! And never forget to say a prayer for the Peoples of Bolivia!",
          "This is a historic church built upon the peace between the rich spaniards and mestizos and the poor indigens The church is nice and classical; however it has been partially restored and in the process some of the charm went away to be replaced by glitterness",
          "This is a really lovely church in the middle of crazy and busy La Paz - worth a visit even if you're not catholic or religious.",
          "The monastery is interesting to visit and there is a nice view from the roof and bell towers. The guided tour provided only basic information and was only in Spanish though they do have alternate tours in English. The information delivered was pretty basic though, and provided",
          "Nice church on a busy square where everyone tries to sell anything. Very close to the touristic Sganaga street.",
          "Me and my friend are Australian and we visited this church today and not only did Daniel fill us with knowledge we had a good laugh together highly recommend for a fantastic experience! Muchas gracias Daniel & San Francisco!! Two proper legends",
          "Beautiful building and a lovely town square adjacent. Exterior architecture is stunning, the solemn dark interior is incredibly interesting. Worth a 30 minute stop.",
          "Cool place to visit, I must for all those visiting La Paz. Here you will see the San Francisco Church, loved the architecture of this church with Mestizo and Baroque influences.",
          "A busy square where everyone collects. Watch your valuables. Church is old and great to take photos of.",
          "You won't believe there is a place hidden in the middle of such trafic noise. San Francisco Church and Museum is worth to visit. There are guided tours and is cheap. You can visit the church and museum just in 30 minutes and climb until the bell tower to enjoy a beautifull",
          "La Paz' oldest church and convent, if I'm not mistaken. Beautiful mestizo decorations on the front and the altar. Also have a look at the museum and the rooftop walk is not to be missed.",
          "Don't miss this attraction. Take your time in the church. The inside of the church might be frightening to young children. My son did find the decorations scary but this is a must see in La Paz.",
          "What a fantastic example of baroque in America. The altares and pulpits are beautiful! You should not miss this place!",
          "It is a gorgeous Church, the architecture and design is very intriguing and appeals to all. The only thing is that on week days they open at 4;00PM, but other than than, well worth it",
          "The best way to see the church is taking the museum tour. The church is more than just a church it's a convent. In old times it used to be a larger convent to which lay people where not allowed.. Now you can see parts of it. The climb to the roof is worth it! Enjoy",
          "For 20Bs you get a guided tour in either English or Spanish, this lasts approx 45 mins so good for teenagers with a short attention span! You get to see around the monastery and the highlight (literally) would be the view from the church rooftop overlooking the city. The access",
          "Besides the church, the huge space in front is a central gathering for many events in the city. In fact, the entire time we stayed here, every night there was a band playing and the plaza is so crowded. Back to the church, it is located in the Sagarnaga area. The",
          "Tours are available every day of the week besides Sunday for 20 Bs. This grants you entrance and also a tour guide. I went alone, and they didn't even make me wait. I got a personal tour. They offer English and Spanish (maybe others but those were the only ones they offered me).",
          "Great spot to be at. The markets start from here, the mall is across the street and the street vendors...we'll some of the best in La Paz.",
          "Located west of El Prado. Founded in 1548. The facade is decorated with stone carvings of chirimoyas, pinecones and tropical birds. It is just a lovely church and when you go inside you can feel at peace and get the feel of how many Bolivians are devoted Catholics.",
          "The church was certainly built on a grand scale and while the Italian marble flooring is opulent the rest is not as ornate as other churches such as in Cusco etc. It's free to get in so worth a quick look if you're passing.",
          "Our guide spoke good English and took great interest in his job. The church is quite amazing. No photos allowed inside but that only cemented the experience for me.",
          "There was a lot of history behind this church, and it is beautifully maintained. Our tour guide was young, but knowledgeable, and we enjoyed our time here. We went on a weekday during the day and ended up being there the same time as some local schools were doing tours, but our",
          "This is a must! We visited the church with an English guide, a very knowledgeable social science student who guaranteed that we got all historical information. The site with the first column of the church in 1549 was impressive, also the visit to the roof top with bells!",
          "Loved the tour, I was guided by a charming young lady that explained everything and I was very impressed. Very nice little tour.",
          "The buildings are amazing, but it was the guide who made it special. A young woman named Helen who spoke excellent English explained the allegorical meanings of the paintings to me in a way that unlocked them for me -- I should add I've been to dozens of galleries all over the",
          "We enjoyed the life and vivacity on the plaza outside of the church. The guide gave us an interesting accounting of the church's start and the early days of Catholocism in Bolivia",
          "This church was founded in 1543 and has a lot of history. There two kinds of tours. The museum tour that takes you up to the bell tower and the church tour. I took the museum tour and was able to take some breath taking pics. Watch you step because the floor and steps are",
          "We didn't have a plan on what to do after returning from Tiwanaku, so we decided to pop in and see the church. It was a beautiful place to visit! The tour guides (free of charge) were great and very knowledgeable, the architecture is beautiful and history of the place is great.",
          "This is one of the most beautiful churches I have ever visited in Bolivia. It is a real historical treasure with a breathtaking architectural baroque style! The interior of the building looks expansive and the \"retablos\" are immensely rich and ornamented; not to mention the",
          "We didn't go inside because it didn't look open. All the locals were sitting in front of the doors. It's a marvellous building to look at from outside anyway. The plaza is a great place to people watch. There is also a huge souvenir market behind and a huge food market in the",
          "Wonderful Colonial Church in La Paz with a crypt beneath the basilica, have a museum in the colonial convent",
          "The church was OK and the convent beside it, nicer. The guide who showed it was not really friendly, She just pointed out four times that 'if by accident you make one of the bells ring you should pay a big fine of 1000 BOV'.",
          "A very building housing an imposing Cathedral of a neo classical style and not the common Baroc style found by most Catholic churches. The building with beautiful Greek style columns is plane but respectfull surrounded by wonderful stained glass made in Italy. The Cathedral was",
          "the church is located in the central plaza. The inside is beautiful with large ceilings and beautiful stained glass",
          "Right in down-town stands this church, the visit includes a tour to the SF monatesry/museum and the temple. My favorite part is to go up to the roof and see the city from there.",
          "Very interesting church in the center of La Paz. I found that La Paz does not have that many exciting places to visit so this one is a must. Like most churches in southern America this one is richly decorated and the main altar is spectacular and do are the side altars.",
          "This is a great place to visit and soak up the history. It's very crowded outside and can be loaded full of tourists. Be careful with your belongings. Read up on the history of this amazing church and the area as well is full of rich history - far away and recent history as",
          "Glamorous, rich, splendid ... There are not too many places in La Paz that deserve a visit, this one definitely does. Decorated in the typical ostentatious manner this is a fantastic place to visit. The main altar is spectacular, much like the ones seen in churches in Peru.",
          "I had been in La paz three times before i finally visited this magnificent gem in the heart of the city. the tour was cheap and well coordinated with excellent hosts that even spoke English. Very impressive service for such a cheap tour. The building and all the paintings are",
          "This was an important church in the history of Bolivia and a visit is a very worthwhile experience. The cost is a paltry. 20 Bolivianos and includes a guided tour. We wandered about reading the English postings but joined a tour which took us to some places we could not access",
          "The church in the middle of the city is Iglesia de San Francisco. Although the building itself is quite old and very impressive, I found the surrounding area to be much more interesting. Up the side street of the church is where you will find all the street vendors selling",
          "Gloria was our tour guide. Great!! Tour was in Spanish, but I understand there is an English option. Very interesting tour with great works of art, then a visit to the top of the church for a birds eye view and a behind the scenes look at the running of the church. So much",
          "Right from the intricate facade and into the church itself...one cannot but go back to the time when this was built, Spanish conquistadores laying what they must have seen a magnificent relic of christianity on South American soil, very rich in design and lavish in gold.",
          "So much colour, a Bolivian flavour of the Catholic faith with strong Spanish roots. A mass started about 10 minutes after we arrived so we did curtail our visit somewhat, but we did enjoy the colourful interior & the facade even more.",
          "The church is a great example of mestizo-baroque. Building and artworks from indigenous people and Spanish colonisers. The adjoining museum is well worth the visit. You can climb to have a great view of the elaborate roofs and tiles and to watch Pace\u00f1os from above on their day",
          "This was a beautiful place to visit and the museum was very interesting as well as the outside of this structure. Very crowded though so beware of your belongings.",
          "You need to get the tour - they will take you places, like the belfry and the painting collection - you can't otherwise see.",
          "This church has an amazing stone carved facade depicting natural themes. The interior has extravagantly carved altar pieces with abundant gold leaf. The cloisters house the museum which is well worth a visit as you get to see the choir, the dome roof and view the the interior",
          "This is one of the old church here. The architecture is good.Quite crowed all the time.Worth the visit.",
          "Many people hang out outside this church, people sitting on the footsteps of the church, either talking or eating or just resting. Quite an interesting site for me. I guess even the outside of the church bring some kind of comfort and rest. The inside of the church is amazing. I",
          "Nice place to know the culture of la Paz and shout America but you have to watch out. It is no a safe place for tourist, take care you cameras, wallet and back pack",
          "Very impressive Spanish style church that is a historic location in the city of La Paz. Sorry no pictures inside, but comeback at night for the free public shows and entertainment outside the church.",
          "The museum basically consists of two rooms, one that explains the story of settlement and the other shows the old brewing equipment. The savior for our 20bs each was access to the roof of the church. Looking down into the church from the upper level was good and then using some",
          "Really interesting Franciscan monastery and church-they have tours in English and Spanish. A lot of history, art and architecture to enjoy.",
          "very nice and relaxing place to unwind and relax. Not a lot to do, would not make a special trip here again.",
          "A historic church at the upper end of El Prado (main street in La Paz), in Plaza San Francisco, first built in 16th century, rebuilt in 18th century. You can go in church for free, and visit the museum for 20 Bolivianos (about \u00a32), where they take you on a tour of the cloisters",
          "We took the tour for 20 bol each, and it includes a guide. The guide was the worst we ever had in our lives. He could not answer any of our questions... Basically you have to follow him, and listen to his explanations, which he learned, but don't be curious you will never get",
          "You can visit the church itself without paying for a tour, and it is quite beautiful on its own. The architecture is very unique with many indigenous touches. However I would recommend that you pay for a tour at the museum next door. It cost us only 20 bolivianos and we were",
          "With nothing to do in the city at the time I paid the entrance fee and didn't expect much. The church is so so beautiful and there's so many rooms to explore. Gorgeous courtyard outside with a garden and fountain. Once you get onto the top roof you have an amazing view of the",
          "Beautiful church, and the included your was great too, really added to the experience, giving you a good history, not just of the church, but of the city too. Must see while in La Paz.",
          "I'd say it's just another church. I was there when the pope visited and the area was quite animated. I prefered the plaza in front of the church to the church itself. This area of La Paz is quite touristical, but It's nice.",
          "It's quite a beautiful church! I was lucky enough to be there during \"Semana Santa\". So there was plenty of activities outside the church. This also meant learning about the history regarding the church without taking the tour. I didn't take the tour this time I visited but I",
          "San Francisco church is located at the end of Sagnagara, a main tourist shopping street. And is beautiful inside. Much more ornate than the main cathedral a few blocks away. Take time to come in to see the sanctuaries and main alter.",
          "I typically get saddened by visiting churches of the conquering society, but in this case, this cathedral was fascinating to me. Pay attention to the foundation of the church, and the small ways that the Bolivian artisans worked in their own aesthetic and expression into the",
          "Nice, but I didn't think it was that special or that it stood out from other churches. Still, the area around it is extremely lively - there are tour agencies, a market, accommodation, etc. that make it a good place to visit.",
          "It is a very good place/ historic site to visit. It is right at the historic central part of La Paz. We love visiting historic sites and this one was very good and we really enjoyed visiting the whole of La Paz city",
          "We have visited a lot if chr he's and whilst it does get a little repetitive, this one is pretty good. We got the free tour with our entry (but slipped a small tip to our guide) and we felt this was a nice way to learn about some if the history, and also be taken up the bell",
          "Bas\u00edlica de San Francisco and its adjoining museum are a gift to the traveler. One can climb to the belfry and enjoy a brilliant view of downtown La Paz. Mass service is also a very rewarding experience for catholic people.",
          "Overall the church is nice and is located in a nice plaza, but it isn't spectacular. HOWEVER, the tour made it much more interesting. I thought it was a bit on the pricier side (bolivia standards) for a tour but it is guided (english or spanish) and lasts about 45 minutes. It is",
          "Building is impressive, typical is churches in South America. Is visited by tourists and locals . At the entrance there is always something going on.",
          "Great stop for a bit of history and chance to walk in the catacombs and see bones of monks in the past.",
          "It is a nice old church in a cute area. The square is always full of people and the neighborhood around it is nice to explore.",
          "Beautiful old church in a great part of the city. In all honestly we weren't the right people to appreciate a historic church, but it is impressive and worth a stop.",
          "That's a beautiful church right in the middle of La Paz! Close to the most famous streets. It is beautiful also inside. During the day, the square in the front is always crowded.",
          "amazing colonial old church in the center of la paz.our hotel was located very close to this church so we have had the chance to see it at different times of the day. quaint spot",
          "This is an very impressing place to see, with art and artifacts all over its almost required to visit this place more than once. I had a great time for hours walking around this huge place which is open to public from the church floor to the spire with the bells. Especially one",
          "Its free...its beautifull ....its....huge...images....it takes you back in time as soon as you get in....not sure if you can take pictures I guess you can....only at the museums you are not allowed to take pictures...",
          "when I get there, a lot of policeman are getting ready for the carnival on the ground in front of the iglesia. it was crazy.",
          "Beautiful facade and plaza outside The inside nothing spectacular and no fotos inside. Lots of souvenir shops in the side street but nothing notable.",
          "This church is close to the witch market which is an area packed with attractions. The crurch itself is old and the interior is very well preserved. The outside is really intricate and just looking at the entrance is a treat.",
          "The San Francisco church as it stands today is built on the site of an earlier one which was destroyed during a massive snowstorm that collapsed the building. The tour includes access to the bell tower. English speaking guides are available, though they are provided gratis",
          "San Francisco is a central spot with lots of activities. Nice place to people watch. We had no problems but do get local advice on safety if you'll be there late in the evenings or at night.",
          "I came to the church in the evening towards the end of a service. I only had about 20 minutes inside so we quickly made a round and ended up seeing most of the statues displayed. The day must have been quite sacred beause there was this little candle filled room that people",
          "The church itself is big and is nice to see all the people around it, when I went for the first time there was a graduation going on and it was cool to see the locals there celebrating however the church itself is nothing extra special in terms of architecture or internal",
          "The Church is quite impressive all though a lot smaller than I was expecting. Next door there is a museum with a wide collection of art that was pretty good. I actually preferred the Basilica further up the road.",
          "Really like how the church makes a real effort to educate people on the history of la paz and the region as you tour through the church. They have signs in English, spanish, and French so you know exactly what you're looking at. Definitely go to the bell tower to look out over",
          "Nice place to vista for an afternoon if you get stuck out in the rain. Some nice architecture, gives a brief history of La Paz and has some very nice art work.",
          "It is an icon of La PAz, Life generates around it. The barroque architecture is very pretty and its shear size imposes, The altar is gorgeous. It is a must see.",
          "We first went into the church and that was spectacular. I am non religious but this church is very impressive. It is very ornate with lots of gold leaf adorning the many saint platforms. The alter was beautiful and inspiring. Right next door is the museum. This is a MUST see. It",
          "This church is on a busy street around the corner from the Witch's market. The streets are full of people and there are definitely people harassing foreigners for money. One followed my husband and I so closely and didn't take no for an answer that we eventually paid him to",
          "Maybe the most beautiful structure in La Paz Nice location but be extremely careful as the place is notorious for thieves and pickpockets. Don't go alone but do go. Food in street good and reasonable",
          "A stunning building in the centre of La Paz where you can sit for hours on the steps and watch the locals go about their business. It really was an amazing spot to people watch.",
          "Very impresive church. It\u00b4s a nice place to hang (outside of course), lots of street artists do their shows at the square in front of the church...",
          "We paid our 20 bobs each not knowing what to expect. The church is immense and OTT which had been our experience in most of Bolivia and Peru. You are able to climb up onto the roof via very narrow staircases. This affords views across the rooftops and to the courtyards below.",
          "It is a good place to tour through and you can even go the the roof for a good view of the city. Good history of the city from the colonial view point.",
          "Watched from far = Amazing... Getting inside = Interesting!!. Personally i recomend to visit the church for a little tour, depending of the guide you will just leave the place amazed or with a lot of ( ??? ). I recomend to visit it at morning when you can go up to the bell tower",
          "San Francisco was part of the original hub of La Paz. The church itself isn't as spectacular as other cathedrals, but is a worthwhile visit for the historical significance. For 20Bs you can go through the museum with a guide. Be sure to ask to go to the roof if it isn't",
          "Here is my review of the museum It costs 20 bolivianos and this comes with a Spanish guide, no English. The museum includes the old church. What I like Very spacious English text on the museum pieces Access to church roof and tower Upper view of the church Centrally located",
          "must visit the museum inside and also the main hall, in the courtyard there are usually activities and free walks during the day",
          "... this cathedral does not compare to the European ones. But there is enough to see with nice decorations, so there will be no regrets visiting the church if it's the first one you see. If it's not and you've had your fill of the dolls representing saints/JMJ, no worries",
          "I went to the Sunday mass.. It was in Spanish which I enjoyed. But they also have English mass. The structure of the church is breath taking there's also history of the church in front. Enjoy",
          "San Francisco Cathedral is an Icon in the La Paz, Original Colonial, the lights make it ever more beautiful at night. I LOVE the typical folkloric stores in Calle Sagarnaga next to the Cathedral. A Must visit place and shop.",
          "San francisco's church is located in the touristic area of La Paz's downtown right beside Sagarnaga street. It has a colonial/franciscan style and a big square in front of it, where there are frequent public artistic presentations.",
          "As with many cathedrals around the world, it's going to look beautiful inside and have interesting architecture outside. The Museum is one of those \"must-do\" things in La Paz, so do it.",
          "Beautifull church with great architecture and beautiful wood carvings. have a seat and watch the locals pray and worship.",
          "Very beautiful it's worth visiting it when u are in La Paz! Make sure u go to the restaurant in front it has an amazing view of it",
          "The church was near my hotel so I visited it for an hour one morning. There was hardly anyone there so I was able to take my time. You can't take pictures inside, otherwise I'd have recorded the wine barrels for making wine and pisco! Staff was friendly enough, I had a janitor",
          "I'll begin by saying that I'm not a huge fan of museums to begin with, but I wasn't super impressed with the tour or the tour guide that comes with the 20 boliviano entry fee. You're mainly looking at paintings, which all have descriptions, so I'd personally rather just go at my",
          "This is pretty much the heart of La PAz, and the square to the front is probably the best spot to enjoy the rich hubbub of local life. there are often musical, cultural events held there, and its a great location to head out from to all areas of the surrounding city too. Same",
          "A lovely plain stone church with extraordinary carvings on the east portal and the high altar. I was sorry that the museum was not open on any of the 4 days that we stayed nearby.",
          "They have a guided tour where you can go up the bell tower and have a nice look from the city. Aside from that, the architecture is so beautiful, that you get to admire all other places behind the facade. Entrance for foreigners is a bit higher, but as a local I truly enjoyed it.",
          "it was an interesting church but it is not a must to do in la Paz, pretty similar to the many churches in Peru with mixed artworks",
          "It opens only at 4pm, it\u2019s rather dark inside, and signs on the wall inside indicate that photography is forbidden. The church itself is a fairly impressive structure when viewed from the street, but inside it\u2019s rather plain, as far as catholic cathedrals are concerned. The",
          "The church itself is a lot like a lot of other Andean Cathedrals but it was originally the church of the Indio with the church for the Spanish across the river (now underneath the street called the Prado). There are guided tours that give you some access to parts of the church",
          "We were able to gain entrance to the church although as previously mentioned no photo's. Worth a walk around to see the luxuries inside the church, however if you are lucky enough to have a guide they will be able to explain the history of the church as well as the structure",
          "This place is easy to locate and perhaps the most lively place in the evenings. The church is pretty decent for a visit, no photographs are allowed. The lane next to the church has lot of shops where you can buy souvenirs.",
          "A catholic church with a lot of pomp in gold inside. Outsite many beggar, \"artists\" and tourists until late in the night.",
          "Some may say that La Paz is short on sights, but this is definitely one not to miss. You can only explore with a guide and photography is not allowed (as is the case with many museums in La Paz). The guide was knowledgeable and they have done a good job preserving relics,",
          "Its easy to find and visit in La Paz. My favourite building in La Paz, the rest of the city is a bit bland/run down.",
          "The San Francisco museum is one of my favorites in the city. It offers great insight into the history of La Paz and the country. It's definitely worth a visit.",
          "This 350 year old church is amazing in terms of both history and architecture! It also has a nice museum. Not so much the glass cases full of old things museum, but more of a walking tour which includes the bell tower with a great view of that area of La Paz. Basically,",
          "Old historic church with art museum, tour of bell tower and choir balcony, and plenty of daily street life out front. Several daily masses are held.",
          "Its cheap and the guides give very interesting information, with great paints and rooms. The guides seem really nice and friendly.",
          "Iglesia de San Francisco is an interesting cathedral, but doesn't really stand out from any others. Go to the museum next to it though and you will get a personalised tour around the former convent and can walk up on to the roof for some great views.",

          "While the church itself is beautiful and worth spending a few moments in, the real gem here is the museum in what used to be the monastery. Completely fascinating glimpse of the history of both the church/monastery, as well as that of the surrounding city.",
          "I would not travel to La Paz to see this church, but if you made it already to La Paz, it's worthwhile visiting this site and its surroundings. Lots of history within (not properly \"packaged\" for tourists, which, in my opinion, is great). Very old construction (for LatAm",

There are plenty of beautiful churches in Potos\u00ed and Sucre, but La Paz has only San Francisco",
          "We went to this museum expecting to see more pictures of Jesus and a church. The price of admission includes a private tour guide (meaning, we walked in and were immediately assigned an English-speaking tour guide), and this tour was excellent! We learned much about Bolivian",

          "The most important historical building of La Paz is the San Francisco church, started in the mid-eighteenth century to replace an old church of the sixteenth century, as the first attempts to raise a temple dating back to 1549. The architect unknown certainly deserves to occupy",
          "I loved to see the church inside, never did it in my life and never imagined it would be so tranquil and peaceful to be inside the building itself. The terrace is awesome for a different perspective of crazy La Paz",

          "Its a beautiful temple and the museum its amazing, you can stand on roofs and see al the antiques. Its great!",

          "This is tipped as one of the most beautiful churches in Bolivia and it certainly lived up to that reputation. I was fortunate to enter the church at the beginning of mass and was able to join in the service and receive a blessing at the alter.",
          "Wonderful, old cathedral in the heart of La Paz, just down the hill from one of the great shopping streets for artisan works. I wish they had been a little more gracious about allowing photographs. Maybe charge a small fee?",
          "If you like churches, this is not to be missed. Great example of the inclusion of indigenous motifs within the Christian themes. The museum associated with the church is also very interesting.",

          "i love the church it is full of spirituality for i am a follower of st. francis of asissi, the only made me sad was when i attended the holy mass you can count on your finger the youth attending holy mass on saturday night and the church is not even full, only old people was",
          "One of the things to see in La Paz. Don't expect an English speaking tour guide. There are readers in both Spanish and English. It's a couple blocks away from Witches Market and makes a great addition to a walking afternoon.",
          "okay. Not spectacular. Many local folks there, and some tourists as well. Well located in the center, and close to calle sagarnaga, the touristic street for artesania....Gd place to stop by and pray for my trip....And thank God for the peace and rest afforded me by the church",
          "It is crowd outside, be careful. Inside and roof walk .. and a great view.",

          "We paid our entry fee and were instantly met by a guide to show us around. She explained all the areas that we were allowed in to with great detail and I dont think we would have enjoyed the church half as much otherwise. She also had keys to the crypt/roof etc which I don't",
          "The church is large, lovely and mostly austere by SA standards (apart from behind the alter). The museo at 20 BS pp is relatively expensive compared to what else you can get for 20 BS - but the view from the bell tower is worth it. We were very lucky that the sun came out as we",

          "Great architecture. Going to the rooftop was great.",
          "The church looks lovely from the outside, with its bare stonework, but if you get a chance - go inside. It is only open for mass, so go at around 6pm and you will be able to see the stunning golden altars. It really is one of the most beautiful colonial churches I have seen",
          "I liked this church because of the distinctively South American way baroque decor was interpreted, with statues of holy figures clothed in elaborate garb, and that a service was still drawing worshippers.",
          "I was in awe at the church and its beautiful altars, paintings etc. Unfortunately there is no photography allowed, same goes for the Museum which is overpriced at 20B.",

          "Good for a laugh once you don\u2019t take it too seriously, gets a bit repetitive but just join in the fun",
          "As long as you relax to see the fun side of it, it\u2019s great fun! The fights all follow the same sort of story line, and it drags on a bit, but it\u2019s fun to sit amongst the El Alto locals and get caught up in the support (or jeering) of the fighters. Some passengers on the bus",
          "A friend mentioned this wrestling show - I hadn\u2019t made any plans so thought why not!!! It was funny and energetic! I was personally picked up at my hotel and brought in a taxi to the venue where I received a free drink, popcorn and a little souvenir! The evening was",
          "Great show for max one hour. Unfortunately, the show in total is 2,5h so if you're not a fan of wrestling you simply will quickly get enough of the fake punches. However, the organisation is pretty good and you don't have to necessary book it as a tour from the agency. Just show",
          "Not sure who we booked with but we had a great night. A lot of fun. I highly recommend this to do if you're in la paz. A fun night out.",
          "I though it would be cholitas wrestling and it turned out to be wresting... I saw 5 fights and just one were cholitas... and it was fake of course, nothing real... It was 20BS for bolivian people and 50BS for foreign people at the entrace... I am not going to repeat...",
          "The Good: 1) Unique bolivian experience, 2)campy, 3)exciting/action packed 4) audience participation is hilarious 5) affordable outing with transportation, drink, snack and souvenir included (paid BOB100) The Not-So Good: 1) some disturbing graphic scenes of men beating up",
          "Waited 1 hour for pick up from hostel, eventually someone came but we ended up walking to the place as the bus had forgotten to pick us up. Already started by the time we arrived. They had run out of (free) drinks. Free T-shirt/wrestling mask had even been downgraded to a key",
          "Soley a show for tourists. A great fight was put on by the performers and they were very interactive with the audience which was fun but I just wished it could have been a little bit more authentic!",
          "After reading some of the recent negative reviews of this event, I wasn't sure what to think. But I booked it anyway because I thought it looked like a good value and a fun time, so why not? The ticket includes round trip transportation from your accommodation, a snack (small",
          "We did a 'guided' tour on a Tuesday. It was sold to us in the cafe 'The Carrot Tree' and was a complete disaster. The Tuesday tours don't take place in El Alto but somewhere in La Paz. We waited to get picked up for about 35 minutes and had to call the tour guide who told us",
          "Do not book this activity via any agency! They will charge you 90bs and take you to a crappy touristy venue with a bad show. If you really want to see cholitas, there are places where mainly locals go, and the shows are only on Sunday. The ticket you can buy directly at the",
          "To each his own. But read the other 1-star reviews. I agree with them all. You are shuffled into a cold warehouse. They give you a drink, half a bag of pop corn and some postcards as part of entry price. Then it's just two hours of rinse and repeat drivel of routines. We had",
          "We loved Cholitas Wrestling. It was a fun, non-serious activity. The drama, the costumes, the fake wrestling. Like a low budget WWE show. The free gift and drink/ snack was fine. Only issue we had was the woman on the bus not checking properly in the hostel reception and",
          "not even worthy of one star, this show is a total waste of time and money. we literally walked out after 25 minutes - men and cholitas \u201cfake\u201d beat each other up and the whole thing is just pretty pathetic. the music is also super loud and we had people smoking in the room too",
          "Very bad, brutal and fake show! Very disgusting too. The Cholitas tried to create a drama by spitting coke and water on other cholitas. My bf and I were sitting in front row and all got wet from their show( and our camera too!) And later one two men with disgusting masks tried",
          "Unique. The first wrestling match was all men which I don't think any of the tourists were interested in, but the cholita vs cholita and cholitas vs man matches had the crowd in stitches and cheering / booing constantly. I think a trip to La Paz wouldn't be complete without",
          "I cant understand why some people give 1 star, seriously they went to a wrestling, that is a theatrical show, and it follow a local style of art. For me worthed fine. I got my VIP pack with some Cholitas that were selling it besides San Francisco church. About the VIP pack? It",
          "I did the walkinf tours and learned about the Cholitas. Traditionally there way of living has been discrimated against and only in the last 15years have they made progress. The event is based in an area which traditionally would have been seen as poor and dangerous to go to.",
          "Went to this not really knowing what to expect. It\u2019s basically WWE wrestling done badly. It was mildly entertaining to begin with. There were about six or seven fights but I was pretty much ready to leave mid way through the second. It\u2019s located quite far out of town and took",
          "It's cold. And you see men (umpires) beating women. Wrestler thrown to the audience. Whether staged or not, total rubbish!",
          "I went with Andean Secrets (booked through Peru Hop). This activity was much more expensive than other activities in Bolivia and it was a complete waste of money - very staged performance; purely for tourists. I thought I would learn about cholitas culture, but I learnt nothing",
          "Don\u2019t expect WWE. It may not be of a very high standard but it\u2019s very funny. And you\u2019d be surprising how athletic a Cholita can be! Fun way to spend an evening.",
          "We booked through the hotel with some other guests staying there so we had a private van and guide pick us up and drive our group the 45 minutes to the El Alto stadium where the cholitas wrestling occurs. It was good to have a guide explain how the indigenous women started this",
          "We attended the cholita wrestling on Thursday night and wanted to try and do it on our own time frame without a tour. It's totally possible! It begins at 5:30pm on Thursday nights and is located in El Alto - you can go enjoy the El Alto market beforehand and then walk to the",
          "We booked this as it was \u00a39 and we happened to be in La Paz on a Sunday evening. We knew what to expect - wrestling is fake, it would be crass with spitting and throwing food and we knew the tourists sit round the ring and the locals up the stands. We thought it was great. It",

          "If you find yourself with a few hours to kill in La Paz, you could do a lot worse than the cholita wrestling. For youbentrance fee, you get two tickets to thw toilets, a small bottle of coke or fanta, popcorn, a bus ticket home and 90 minutes of WWE style wrestling, only with a",
          "We booked this through Red Cap Tours for 90B. Pick up was roughly around 3pm and included transport, entrance with ringside seats, a drink & popcorn and a souvenir (choice between a cholita pen or pack of 5 postcards). The show runs from 5-7pm on Thursdays and Sundays and",
          "They have shows every Thursday and Sunday night, and we went to the Sunday evening show. We went in having read other reviews, and they prepared us pretty well for what we were about to see. The show is definitely put on for the tourists, as they have chairs set up around the",
          "We wanted to do this under our own steam so took a collectivo to Ceja (2B) then walked about 7 blocks to the stadium. Foreigners aren't allowed to buy the cheaper 15B to sit on the benches with locals anymore but have to buy the 50B executive tickets and sit at the front with",
          "This was a fun night, not knowing what to expect we were really surprised with the action packed audience participation show colourful loud and funny! Well worth 13 dollars for bus trip show drink snack and souvenir !",
          "The only good thing about this is that you get free popcorn with a drink and a souvenir. The whole night was boring and you had to force yourself to laugh, wouldn't recommend unless you've had a few beers or so",
          "It was fun when the actual cholitas were wresting, I'm not a wrestling fan so seeing the guys wrestle wasn't very interesting but I enjoyed the cholita s. It drags far too long too, two fights would have been enough for me. They give u a bit of their history and you even get",
          "Definitely not for everyone but my partner, friends and I enjoyed the atmosphere and snack, souvenir and drink provided. It is fake, but with the men attacking the women you can see when they attack there are loud sounds made with their feet, arms and back ground break (do",
          "This is honestly not for everyone. Seems like people either loved it or were just bored to bits. It is basically female wrestlers in traditional dress (frilly skirts, layers of petticoats, tight long sleeve tops) \"fighting\" each other WWE style. Interesting probably for the",
          "I enjoyed Cholitas Wrestling a lot. For those who are unfamiliar, this is a lucha libre, or American Professional Wrestling sort of wrestling show, except the wrestlers are local native Aymara women dressed in traditional frilly garb. Also, I should say, it's staged, like",
          "I read many mix reviews before going, but I decided to try it anyway. All in all, I think it's fun, but I understand some people might not enjoy. So before you decide to go, read this: - if you are expecting a WWE quality show for around 15 dollars, then this show might not be",
          "We booked the tour with redcap. Worst experience, we felt in the wrestling like the most stupid tourists while the 'fight' were more perverse than entertaining... after 1 out of the two hours we had enough waited outside (with a lot of other also) once the busses were ready they",
          "This was absolutely the worst decision I made in La Paz. It was NOT entertaining, it was downright disturbing. I fully understand that it is \"fake\" and \"acting\" but it was beyond horrible watching a man beat up a woman no matter how fake it may be. She was still in pain, she",
          "Went here on a Thursday, it was nice but the acting was very poor. There wasn't much of an atmosphere.",
          "We took the tour at 90bolivianos to go there. it includes the entrance ticket, transport from and to your hostel, a souvenir, a snack (popcorn and soft drink) and toilet. The show itself was ok, we enjoyed it, the wreslers interact a lot with the public which is good, but we",
          "Don't lose your time if you're looking for anything traditional. This is just stupid US catch with some women dressed traditionally. Thw guys were stupid costumes. There is nothing Bolivian or traditional here. Disappointed. I thought it was real wrestling.",
          "It was quit weird. Can not advise you this activity. The best thing was that you get a drink, popcorn and a souvenir \ud83d\ude03",
          "Really funny wrestling show! 3 Cholitas wrestling matches plus another 3 men's. It's cold inside and toilets aren't in good conditions but the show made up for it! You don't have to be a wrestling fun to have a great time!",
          "The show is funny and since you can only see it in la paz you should go. They say it's better in Sunday, when there are more local people in the audience. On Thursday it was only tourists. Nevertheless, acting is bad, light years from the lucha in Mexico.",
          "You come to cholitas wrestling thinking you are gonna see two cholitas wrestling against each other. Well, it is not always the case! I went with some friends and during the 3 hour \"wrestling show\", we only saw 2 cholitas wrestling...against men. Even though it might be",
          "You will not see it at home so if you are for unique and sometimes corny experience - go! Women fighting with guys and between each other in a traditional or 'American wrestling outfits'it's so funny! and I would not call it 'only for tourist' as there Was a lot of locals",
          "Wrestling and Cholitas.... I didn't imagine the cholitas owned any irony! And I was very skeptical to this wrestling show, but something this hysterical funny I couldn't imagine! If you don't want to put so much money into it, take the red cable car up yourself and find",
          "We went with honey tours to watch the cholita wrestling. After being picked up at 5.15 it took two hours to get there. We finally arrived at the show at 7.15. The show went until 8.00 and then we spent another hour on the bus home. You couldnt even purchase a water or a beer,",
          "This was one of the most crazy events I have ever seen - it definitely wasn't boring!! The wrestling wasn't the best I've ever seen, but it was hilarious and there were lots of locals there so I think it's a good thing to see to get a taste of local entertainment! It's better to",
          "Really worthwhile trip up to El Alto to see this crazily ridiculous show. Part of a Red Cap all inclusive tours so everything went smoothly and made for a fun & entertaining day.",
          "The wrestling of the men was not that impressive, but the ladies make the show worth every single cent! Must see attraction in a Thursday or Sunday in La Paz!!!",
          "This was the the weirdest thing i ever saw. The wrestling is very fake and only for tourists. It's entertaining for 10 min but goes on for 2 hours. Take warm clothes if you go, it in a hall but with holes everywhere so you basically sit outside. No taxi would take one earlier",
          "This was a complete waste of an evening and money. You payed the equivalent of about \u00a310 for transfer and the show, but it was like watching a bad pantomime where the \"actors\" pretended to hit and slap each other across the faces and reactions were so delayed that even from a",
          "This is the biggest mistake we made in Bolivia. Or actually during our 3months in south america. It is just an touristic event, no locals there at all. You get a \"vip\" seat; plastic chairs, something to drink and popcorn. It is one big show, starts off too late and first",
          "Enjoyable as a tourist. Might be a little confused if you don't know what Cholitas are, but still good fun. We went as part of red cap tours and it was a good time, although we were left to fend for ourselves fo getting back to central La Paz (thank god for another tour group",
          "A really fun evening out - had never been to wrestling before and this was a great introduction because the women were fierce! Good that you got free popcorn, drink and lil souvenir and picture with the cholitas too. My only complaint is that the bus from our hostel (Loki) took",
          "Definitely put on for the tourists but a funny nights entertainment! Didn't like it when the men attacked the women but it seems it's all pretty staged and it was very funny! Take warm clothes, it's freezing as soon as it gets dark",
          "This is not a absolute must do in La Paz, but you can still enjoy this weird show for few bucks. Your ticket also includes transportation to El Alto, snack, drink and a souvenir. Of course, this is wrestling and everything is fake, but I still had a decent evening watching them.",
          "So didn't know if this was for me. Was my last night in La Paz so thought, Why not? Organised trip to the venue in El Alto. Local to the banked seats at the rear, tourists to the ring side seats. Despite my best efforts of trying to sit pan faced, unamused I couldn't help get",
          "It's dramatic fake wrestling - decently entertaining for the first two sets but then it just starts getting repetitive. I thought this was something catering to the locals but it feels very very touristy. Also thought it was very sloppy that they started doing photos for the",
          "If you've got nothing better to do on a Sunday night, go. Otherwise skip it. Definitely book with a travel agent, because transportation home is questionable. Male and female wrestlers, featuring the women at the end. Bad acting that gets worse as the bouts progress --think",
          "Wow! What a show. Staged in an airy stadium in the middle of El Alto, locals and tourists came together to see women in traditional dress battle it out. The cholita matches were alternated with other more traditional lucha libre matches. It was an entertaining way to spend a",
          "This didn't quite turn out as we expected. Yes, there were beautifully dressed women doing a series of staged wrestling bouts, but it lacked the energy it needed. This was probably to do with the fact it was in the coldest, draftiest building ever. As the evening progressed",
          "This is fun to do if you need to kill time in La Paz, but I wouldn't hang around just for it. I was expecting this to be a local event. It's not. I think there were maybe 7 locals who were probably the wrestlers family and/or friends. It is completely geared for tourists. The",
          "It was funny, entertaining yet brutal and intense experience. There were few ladies matches, and the main event was an all hell break loose type hardcore game, where the guys were fighting like no tomorrow. You have to come see for yourselves. It;s different to anything you have",
          "Worth an hour, but not much more of your time in La Paz. Some pretty amateur maneuvers but wrestlers don't take situation seriously and interaction with mainly gringo audience is pretty good. Not easy to get to if you don't know way around El Alto. Most locals don't even know",
          "We got approached on the street in La Paz on a Sunday afternoon by a lovely (non-pushy) lady who gave us a leaflet. We decided to just do it. It was 60 bobs each. You hop on the chicken bus and they take you up to el alto (the ride had really great views) to the hall were it all",
          "We booked this through our hostel, Hostal Ananay and they collected and dropped us off . We loved the whole evening and thought it was hilarious, if you have kids you have to go , our two are still talking about it and wearing their wrestling masks. Yes some of the moves might",
          "First, the venue is on a mountain top in El Alto in a run down community center/athletic building amid a large, bustling market with loads if buses and traffic. Be prepared for crowds, noise and new experiences with locals before you even get inside. Interesting but not why I",
          "We booked a Sunday walking tour of La Paz with Red Hat that ended the tour with a trip to the Cholita wrestling match (only on Sundays) just outside (in the highlands) of La Paz. Of the 60 or so odd gringos in attendance (all in the front row by the way) I think that our group",
          "We love to go & watch local sports wherever we visit in the world, so we had to get tickets to watch the cholitas wrestling! What a great evening's entertainment! TIP 1: Be warned, the stadium is up in El Alto, the city above La Paz & it's not heated, so it gets pretty cold",
          "You must go there . One of the funniest evening i had in the trip. It's once a week on sunday so don't miss it. The bus also stops on the way for taking photos from a viewpoint of La paz .",
          "I went to Cholitas Wrestling to see cholitas, but most of the show is of men romping around like circus clowns. They play-act wrestling moves in such slow motion that much of the show seems forced. And yet, I was entertained and would go again. It's one of those shows that is so",
          "Cholitas Wrestling is completely bonkers but an absolute must-do in La Paz. Take an organised tour bus - you get a drink, popcorn and souvenirs thrown in, plus the mini-bus transfer. It's safe - but be very aware of pickpockets. Never seen them move so fast.",
          "This was 'la cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me' in our days in La Paz, we took the tipical tour from our Hostel and they took us on bus, it's like an hour from downtown, because they spend time gathering people from other hostels. Once you get there they give you a voucher with 6 tickets, 2 bus",
          "I saw Cholitas Wrestling with my friends. I should take mini bus (the destination is CAJA) from San Francisco church to near the stadiam(2 Boliviano). You need to get off when you see the bridge. It takes 30 mins to get there. The ticket for tourist costs 50 Boliviano including",
          "The first five minutes was interesting then it was boring. Wouldn't do it again. There are too many other fun things to do in La Paz. Very strange and not worth the price or the time.",

        "wiki": "The Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace  (Spanish: Catedral Bas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz), also called La Paz Cathedral, is a cathedral and minor basilica is located in Murillo Square in the city of La Paz in Bolivia. It was built in 1835 with a neoclassical architecture with Baroque elements. It has an interior consisting of five naves  with different layers.\nThe first cathedral of La Paz was completed in 1692 after 70 years of construction; the first building was made of stone, lime and brick. In 1831 it was decided to demolish it due to the collapse of his presbytery and several cracks that threatened its collapse. The construction of the current cathedral began on March 24, 1835; it was inaugurated in 1925, marking the first centenary of the founding of the Republic of Bolivia. Although it opened that year, its interior ornamentation still continued until 1932.\nIn 1989, its two lateral towers were opened, this event coinciding with the visit of Pope John Paul II.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoman Catholicism in Bolivia\nCathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Enjoyed our visit to the cathedral which is just a few blocks from the malecon in the center of town. Beautiful cathedral. They were redoing all the outside gardens and walkways so it will even be more beautiful in a few weeks. Must visit when in town.",
          "The full name of this church is Nuestra Senora de La Paz Airapi Mission. It was founded by the Jesuits. The towers on either side of the main entrance are impressive as is the color of the stone. This church and the gardens directly in front of the church are stops on the",
          "We were told the 2 columns of this cathedral were built at 2 different times. The left side was built in the the 1918 and the right side in 1928. Overall a nice place to visit so some relaxing down time",
          "A nice little church with a plain interior. Like the wooden roof with the circular cupola in the middle. They are presently working on the square in front and the government offices so it is not very peaceful, but will be beautiful when they are finished.",
          "This is a beautiful old cathedral in a central part of town. There is currently road works going on right outside, so it's not as peaceful there as it would normally be. However it is still certainly worth the stop. The interior had beautiful arched ceilings with chandeliers",
          "This was one of or stops from a tour we did. Always special to see a bit of history when you travel --- Near and or far.",
          "La Paz Cathedral (full name Catedral de Nuestra Senora de la Paz) was a brief stop during our day-trip to La Paz. But, it was a beautiful visit; the two-tower stone sculpted building is impressive. Passion of the Christ depictions line the inside of the sanctorum. Spent a",
          "Pros: great location, great breakfast (authentic mexican food only), comfortable clean rooms. Cons: hard to find anyone who spoke English, asked for a 2nd wash cloth told they didnt have any. Don't expect to sleep in, rooms are around open courtyard where breakfast starts at 7",
          "Loved this cathedral, was built in the 1600's. Must see church in town. Loved the architecture and the wooden stages of the cross on the walls. Plus there's a special prayer room in the back.",
          "By today's standards this is a small church but when it was built I'm sure it was considered huge. There are some old stained glass windows, the doors are probably original to the structure and are enormous which begs the question if where they came from since La Paz is desert.",
          "The walk from the Malec\u00f3n up to the Cathedral was great. Grab a paleta de nieve and walk up to the Cathedral, if it is Saturday, make sure you stop at the farmers market. There is a cute plaza across the street from the Cathedral, great for people watching.",
          "Happened upon the church by going to the Saturday market just across the street from it and what an amazing view.",
          "Very sweet little area with a garden and museum across the street. Nice cool place to rest out of the sun in this sweet little town. Feels very safe and laid back.",
          "Lovely cathedral, nice stained glass and statues. Mass times were 0700, 1000, 1700, 1830, & 2000. Very nice service with choir.",
          "We explored the city of La Paz and went to this cathedral and it is a beauty. It is on the square a couple blocks up off the Malecon.",
          "Within the cathedral complex is this lovely orphanage. Bring gifts and love and giggles! We spent a day eating treats doing magic and puppet show....laughter giggles and an unforgettable day in la paz b4 swimming with turtles dolphins and whales!",
          "This is a fairly small and average church by central/ south American standards. Not really worth a special trip to see it.",
          "I am huge fan of histroicql churches and this one is very nice. Wood ceilings and a real sense of the construction period",
          "I was so thankful that I could visit this beautiful place on a Sunday morning. I heard the choir singing and the bells ringing as the congregation was gathering and I stopped to look at the items the nuns were selling out front. I sat in the back of the sanctuary for a few",
          "We happened to be there for a wedding ceremony, which was very moving. It's close to everything and worth a stop to admire.",

          "Charming old cathedral in the center of La Paz with a nice plaza in front. Easy distance walk from downtown.",
          "Amazing hotel shame about the location, I wouldn't recommend to stay there for two weeks! Definitely hire a car and get out and explore the coast! The breakfast was great, the pool was cold but great roof top views!",
          "A great see in LA Paz. The old mission with it's beautiful stained glass windows. The building brings you back to the early 1800s",
          "We visited the La Paz Cathedral on our last trip. There's a nice park across tha street where you can sit and relax",
          "At the centre of La Paz is this old, historic building full of tradition. Our Lady of Peace Cathedral was originally built in the 18th century and a must see while in La Paz!",

          "A modest cathedral across from the Plaza. It is not too large or ornate provides a peaceful refuge from a hot day sightseeing.",
          "Very pretty cathedral in the heart of La Paz. A short walk to the park and restaurants. Interesting bit of history.",
          "Once we got downtown, first thing we visited was this beautiful old cathedral. We did go inside and mass was being held. I would really like to hear a presentation on its history and other significance, but otherwise it\u2019s a don\u2019t-miss spot.",
          "I love the location and structure of this Cathedral. You can walk around it\u2019s plaza and straight to Malec\u00f3n. There\u2019s a coffee shop at the corner of the Cathedral with great coffee. You have pharmacies, ice-cream shops and all kinds of stores. Unfortunately, we were able to",
          "The good thing is that you can easily find close to Malecon and in the city center. very interesting architecture and what's more its nice place to hide in hot hot day from sun",
          "Simple, well kept and the center of town...worth the walk there and maybe to sit in the park if hot!",
          "The Cathedral is easy to find, just a few blocks up from the Malecon in La Paz. What you see is what you get - it's a church. We looked for info about its history inside the church but did not find any. To the left of the main entrance, there is an interesting historical",
          "Gorgeous cathedral, just a few blocks up from Malecon. Stained glass is beautiful. Fascinating history. Picturesque facade. Worth a visit, especially for anyone who is interested in the California missions. Plan 30-60 minutes to appreciate the whole thing...although you can do a",
          "While walking around La Paz we stopped in to look at this historical building. While I gave it 5 stars it's not for the attraction so much as for the history. We have traveled up & down the west coast & have always enjoyed stopping in at the missions & church's. It gives you an",
          "Walking along the backstreets of La Paz you'll find this nice little church that has very nice architecture and a little plaque on the outside with a brief history.",
          "Love walking thru old Churches and this is no exception many tourists stop there. Beautiful ceilings",
          "I was married here in 1996 after getting permission from the church. I met and fell in love with a woman from La Paz and the church was perfect. We visit every trip and recommend everyone go in. I have been to almost all the church\u2019s on the peninsula and some are more Rustic but",

          "This is a large Catholic Cathedral, rebuilt in 1835, the original was finished in 1692 taking 70 years to complete. There is an office where we were able to purchase a mass for a friend who had just passed away. Very friendly people, beautiful cathedral.",
          "Worth a visit when touring La Paz. Some nice stained glass windows but has quite a modern feel to it..",
          "Pretty inside and outside, nice bell concert. At Christmas they have classical concerts with multi- colored lights, very festive. Across from the church is the 'Casa de Gobierno' where they often have really interesting expositions, like now it's about fishing (free entry)!",
          "From the outside, this is really a nice church. I like the twin bell towers and the outside has that solid, rustic look that are so typical of mission architecture. From the outside it's really impressive. However, the inside is anything but. Although the stained glass windows",
          "It was a nice experience. Very pretty inside and historical. People were in there praying, so just have to be respectful of them.",
          "Nice architecture, reminds me of Spain, on a hot day, the cathedral is cool inside; area gets busy on Sundays.",
          "Went to mass. It was very well attended. Wish there had been a better posting online about mass times.",
          "We went to a farmers market and happened upon this building. What looked like a double wedding was happening, so we only walked around the outside of the building. It's a great example of architecture from the time period around 1860.",
          "The Cathedral was beautiful. I almost hated taking some pics in there. It was very old but worth seeing",
          "Under renovations. Not wonderful. Don't waste your time here. Very plain. Not much to see here. There, 100 characters!",
          "A small and unassuming cathedral. Downtown La Paz is not particularly impressive, the town is not my top choice for cultural landmarks. If you are in the area you would find the cathedral difficult to miss.",
          "one of the church towers dates back to the 16th century. Spend some time here. It's a Holy Place. Read the plaques. Wander inside and out. It's a cornerstone of devotion for all the people of La Paz.",
          "La Paz Cathedral is definitely worth a visit. Beautiful inside and out. It was quiet and peaceful inside.",
          "We were unable to walk inside because they had a service in progress when we stopped by. We only took a peak from the doors. Nice Cathedral and the plaza in front is nice to sit and have a cup of coffee.",

          "The cathedral was only a block away from our hotel, El Angel Azul, and across the street from a lovely square. The door seemed to be open all the time except after 9:00PM or so. Stop in and say a prayer, or attend one of the *many* masses offered daily in Spanish.",
          "We walked all over the area and loved going inside the cathedral for a look. It is peaceful and quite lovely. Nothing more to it really than just looking around or sitting in a pew to cool off or pray in silence.",
          "We always like to visit places of worship though out the world just for the beautiful architecture! Beautiful exterior with a plaque explaining the churches history. A service was in progress so we just peeked inside and the interior and stained glass was gorgeous.",
          "This church was directly across the street from the hotel we were staying at. It was Christmas Eve the day of our arrival, so we had the privilege of experiencing a traditional catholic service in this very old church. It's full of old tradition, and clearly represents many",
          "When you are wandering the downtown area, the cathedral is one place you will want to include on your list of places to see. As with many towns established in the Spanish tradition, you will have the church, plaza mayor/principal and government buildings all located together and",
          "The church and plaza across the street create that small Mexican town atmosphere, and the exterior of the church is attractive. The interior is interesting in that the stations of the cross are all captioned in English. It is a rather plain interior, but you can spend a few",
          "This is a very pretty mission. The outside is well maintained and they are working on the inside. Beautiful stained glass windows and just a lovely place. Well worth the visit.",
          "Beautiful old Cathedral with lots of history. Seen quite a few wedding parties here over the years. Lots of color in the family wedding settings here.",
          "Beautiful cathedral in the zocalo. However found it very strange that as soon as we walked in a lady was begging us for money.",
          "The best church to pray, a nice church to visit, in the center of the town, enjoy and pray! This is a blessed country!",
          "Beautiful cathedral in city center , lovely build and open for everybody. When you visits la Paz just have a look, its like most of the cathedrals always beautiful . What else \ud83d\ude00",
          "We like churches, so visited this one. Scenic setting in the square and interesting melange of rock types to make it. Not much history available for the Spanish-challenged. Pretty plain but interesting inside. You are not here to see what churches in Spain or Italy look",
          "As I stayed in a hacienda two blocks away, I could hear the church bells each day. It reminded me of the cultural roots of this small ocean centered community. The Cathedral is the epicenter of community life.",
          "This catherdral is one of the oldest in La Paz. It is beautiful and definitely a must see! The jardin across the street is a wonderful place to sit in the shade and watch the world of centro go by!",
          "Lucky to be there for this special service. Luckily got there early so we could sit. Service at 10 and by 9:50 it was SRO. beautiful church.",
          "Great place to sit and revitalise after walking the malecon. Always awed by churchesan this one is so impressive in its own understated way.",
          "Beautiful cathedral decorated for Christmas. Open during the day so travelers and locals can come in for a quiet look or prayer.",
          "The Cathedral was a stop on our walking tour with Red Travel. Our guide Hugo told the story of its architecture and construction. Worth a stop even without the tour",
          "Rather enjoyed the simplicity of this cathedral as it contrasts favourably, in my opinion, with the conspicuous opulence of many. In an attractive setting, near markets, shopping, coffee shops, street vendors.",
          "Just a few blocks off of the Malecon sits the historic Catedral de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz. Old structure, was built from 1861-1865. Very nice inside. Catholic church is a quiet place out get out of the heat. Right next to Jard\u00edn Velasco, a nice one block park.",
          "Dont waste a lot of time here, a quick stop is all you will need. The architecture and old world charm make it a nice visit.",
          "Jesuit Father Jamie Bravo founded the permanent Mission of La Paz in 1861, This old mission church (Cathedral) has been well maintained and is worth a visit when in La Paz. Catholic mass, in Spanish, is available several times each Sunday. I have attended Mass several times at",
          "We were privileged to attend a friend's wedding in this beautiful cathedral and would recommend a visit if you are walking through the city.",
          "Very beautiful and serene cathedral. Exterior a mix of stone from the area. Interior simple, clean white, beige and gold.",
          "The Cathedral is constructed of stone of a pale purple - mauve - which gives the building an unusual pleasant appearance. The church is less ornate than some others in Mexico, but still possesses architectural elements common to many cathedrals. The stained glass windows are",
          "I generally head for the main church when visiting a town, and all too often I find it locked. The Cathedral in La Paz was open each time I dropped in, and is a welcome piece of old-world Mexico in the central square of a busy town. With coffee bars and a pleasant park outside",
          "Don't spend a lot of time here, its a nice site, not a lot to see off the beat and path. Nice History, pretty anticlimactic.",
          "We stopped here during our tour of La Paz. The Church architecture and history are very interesting. We enjoyed our visit here.",
          "basic architecture, both outside and in. It was OK, though not alluring enough to spend more than 10 minutes; the walk to & from was not particularly appealing.",
          "This Cathedral is small and a mixture of old and new. It is worth a visit while in La Paz, best to take a tour of La Paz and see some other local sites.",
          "Not extraordinary, humble place, where people go in crowds. We visited the Cathedral on Sunday, just before the noon. It was more than full, the service was going on - all impressive and nice to see and hear. Neatly decorated interior.",
          "During our brief visit to La Paz as part of a day-long tour from Cabo san Lucas, our Esperanza's Tours La Paz Encounter tour stopped here. We were able to enjoy the sanctuary and take photographs of the interior and exterior. This is a well-kept building. The skylight in the",
          "One of the top places to visit in La Paz and easy to find. If your lucky a tour group will be there and you can listen in on the history which adds to the Cathedral. Important part of the community and worth visiting if you are here.",
          "Not a grand or imposing cathedral, but it felt very \"sincere.\" There's a bit of interpretive history nearby, and it's on the way to a walk to the local English-language bookstore. Worth a stop, especially for the faithful, to enjoy the religious experience and a sense of the",
          "We went here on a tour. Great history and it seems well cared for. This was built by the Jesuits when they came into Mexico and we were given history of what they did while there.",
          "We have seen many cathedrals in Mexico and this is not the best, nor the worst but it is a beautiful church, both inside and out. In fact, the outside is very simple but there is a simple elegance inside with its yellow domed arches and white trim. There are two plaques",
          "It sits at one side of the town square and is very basic and simple but was worth a 5 minute photo opp and peak inside. Nothing like other Cathedrals you may be thinking of or what you see in Europe but nice local culture.",
          "It's not overly fancy, but it is sincere and soulful - very locally spiritual. Worth a few minutes to get there and a quiet, meditative visit.",
          "This cathedral is small and fairly plain compared to other cathedrals I have seen. It is lovely, none the less. The statues and decor in Catholic churches are always interesting to me. The square in front of the church is nice as well. There are benches and it serves as a",
          "Not the most ornate or impressive church in Mexico by far ... but OK for a quick look. There are more interesting things to see in La Paz.",
          "this is normal church, not flamboyant. If your looking for a cathedral this is not it But it is a nice spot to learn about the culture",
          "Beautiful to see. It is a must if you are in LaPaz. So much history. I have to admit. I have been to Europe and have seen some amazing churches.This is probably a sanctuary for the people of Mexico as a community.",
          "Pretty stained glass windows, small and intimate. There was a lovely tiny chapel with individuals praying. The altar had flowers very pretty well maintained. Close to shopping and city building",
          "the cathedral was beautiful. did not have enough time in there to see all the statues. we were rushed by our tour guide. excursion offered per princess cruise",
          "This is a beautiful old cathedral and should be of interest to folks that like historical buildings. It is magnificent",
          "The cathedral is beautiful. We stopped in to take some photos and came across a christening. In fact, they were christening a number of people of all ages, from baby to senior citizens. It was quite moving and interesting to watch.",
          "Despite the exterior's larger scale the interior of the cathedral is small and intimate. Really lovely.",
          "It's worth a look if you are passing by, but it's nothing special so don't go out of your way to see it.",
          "I have visited Catholic cathedrals in many different countries and this one has to be the most unadorned cathedral I have ever seen. This is not a criticism, just a fact. A short visit of 10 minutes will be enough.",
          "I'm fascinated by the devotion to churches and cathedrals in Mexico. Their devotion to living a blessed life is beautiful. The detail in all Mexican churches shows their love so I can never say enough good about visiting any Cathedral in Mexico",
          "Beautiful old cathedral, not big if compared to older European cathedrals, but it must have been enormous for the population that the peninsula used to have. Great place to visit, bells still ring on the hour, and it's only 2 blocks from the beach and touristy area. Bonus, to",
          "The Cathedral in Central La Paz is a step back to the Old Mexico. Church bells ringing and the structure do reminiscent of hundreds of years ago. A must see for everyone",
          "Thank you for the opportunity pray to you, to sing to you in Spanish. Thank you for a safe and enjoyable time with friends.",
          "Very nice old cathedral...cornerstone laid in 1861. Went thru in the morning and happened to come by in the afternoon while a wedding was taking place...charming!",
          "Not impress of the upkeep and not so historical there's nothing to be surprise like a wow factor.... Very simple less parking and less touristy not unlike the cathedrals in Austria, or European countries.",
          "this is a fine old church... and a good place to meditate and get away from the pounding sounds of the city.... as i fallen catholic i found some peace and quiet without too much guilt just sitting in the church ...",
          "A beautiful cathedral in the heart of La Paz. We had a wonderful walk through, and the plaza was a great place to soak in the city.",
          "This church was built in the 1800's and has never been remodeled and it looks as if it was just done. Great altar and for Christmas had the best manger scene I have ever seen",
          "This is a nice very small church in the middle of town. You can walk around or try some of the small coffee shops or restaurants around it.",
          "Simple, pretty Church. But one can feel the grandeur mixed with the difficulty of the architecture for the materials available at the time. (i.e. crystal chandeliers, curved wooden ceiling). I would have loved to attend a service, but the decorations were fabulous. And the fact",
          "Nice, traditional Spainish architecture made all festive for the Christmas Holidays. Friendly, enjoyable atmosphere and open to wander in and have a look.",
          "no reason not to stop by and poke your head in, but nothing too exciting. The cathedral under construction is also worth a peak, even in its completely unfinished state, just because its so big.",
          "Mexico has many very grand cathedrals. This is not one of them. To get the true flavor of this place, it's necessary to attend a service here and experience the devotion of the parishioners.",
          "I agree with Friar 4 our Cathedral is not impressive by any means whatsoever compared to other Cathedrals in the world. I think the one in Guadalajara is much more impressive. However... take in account WHERE we are, and WHEN it was built, and then you could say it is",
          "One needs to walk up a street from where the tour buses let you off, but it's worth the walk. The cathedral is very quaint, and we were able to watch a service take place. The architecture is very pretty, and it's amazing to see how they much they built with just stone. A major",
          "Worth a visit. Impressive stone cathedral in this dusty humble Baja Town. Faces the town square. Good energy inside.",
          "This Cathedral was built in the 1800's. It's nice and in use by the locals. If you have seen many Cathedrals, you won't be wowed. It is across from Plaza de la Constitucion, which is also OK. I wouldn't rank these sites as major draws for La Paz.",
          "The La Paz cathedral is worth a visit. Like most Spanish colonial churches in Mexico the architecture alone is worth the visit. Check it out!",
          "A beautiful old Cathedral. Just sit in a pew and feel the serenity wash over you. An absolute must stop by for anyone with a real interest in the history of La Paz.",
          "Not a fabulous building but nice. Worth a look. Not difficult to park for awhile. Good photo op for recording visit to la Paz.",
          "Worth a pop in to see the chandeliers and the art. The virgin de Guadalupe was very nice. Worth a ten minute stop!",
          "La Paz Cathedral is a small gem in downtown La Paz. Beautifully decorated and serene, it's a restful place and well worth a visit. Peaceful atmosphere and a long history, nicely explained in the entry signs in both Spanish and English.",

          "We paid to see this and i thought there was a tour guide but no one came. It was very small and not a whole lot to say. a lot about cocaine and the history of coca in all its forms. Nothing too interesting really.",
          "Don't waste your money on this silly exhibit unless you are desperate for a laugh. Its only strength is that it is open at lunch time.",
          "Great museum about the history and background of Coca. They have brochures in many different languages, so Spanish is not necessarily required.",
          "I agree with the agenda clearly pushed by this museum, on the other hand I prefer my museums to be a little less in-your-face about their agenda. Yes the confusion between coca and cocaine is obviously silly and, yes, the war on drugs is attacking a plant with a long history of",
          "The information this museum provides really helps you understand the value the coca leaf has on this culture. They give a great history about its role in Bolivia. It also touches on the negative stigma it gets because of the drug trade. I recommend it for the information it",
          "The place is small but the owner was helpful. I was given English information to understand the exhibits. Just an ok museum for me.",
          "Ok so as some other reviewers and lonely planet state it is a bit \"tired\" but you do get a pretty decent history of the coca leaf and cocaine and some other pretty interesting info. Some of the info should definitely be updated but my wife and I really enjoyed it.",
          "The museum is ok - the information it provides isn't much new. The court yard in front is beautiful. Did not try the cafe - but a lot of different coca based drinks.",
          "The museum did provide an assortment of information but the display and set up is poorly done. I guess my favorite part was then little cafe upstairs. There you can try different drinks made from the coca leaf. The prices are pretty reasonable for it being \"touristy\". The guy",
          "There is no English description inside the museum, but you will be given a book to read about the translations, so we turned out sitting just besides the reception reading the book most of he time, and then take 5 minutes to go inside the museum to have a quick look of the",
          "It may not be much to look at, but if you're curious about the history, use, and culture surrounding the coca leaf - this is a wonderful museum to visit. Who knew there was so much to learn about the tiny coca leaf. Its significance is fascinating, and I think it's definitely",

          "This museum looks like someone's project on cocaine and the coca leaf. Although some of the information is interesting and there are a few good physical displays and photos, there is far too much reading which distracts from the experience. The sequence of panels is not always",
          "Yes, you can find good information about coca, though some of it seems to be a bit old. Actually, I would not call it a museum, since it is mainly some tiny rooms with information specially for reading. Ten people there and it is a crowd. Nice restroom!",
          "Neat to see if you are interested in coca and it's history, but the one in Cusco (free Sundays) I found to be better put together. Worth a visit if you can't go in a different city.",
          "Meh... it's fine if you have nothing else to do. The information was interesting and for the price it's okay. If you are walking around and have 20 or 30 minutes to spare then go for it.",
          "My husband and I visited here because we had time to spare... it doesn't take long to get through the museum, it's rather small but super interesting. I learnt sooo much stuff here - you just have to be willing to read through the exercise book they give you to take around (but",
          "The coca story itself is very interesting, but the museum is terrible. They numbered the pannels according to the parts os the story is belongs, but the sequence is very confusing to follow and after part 15 (it's about 20) they stop numbering. The graphic design is also",
          "We went here as had a few hours to spare. It only cost 13 bolivianos to get in so we thought we may as well give it a go. It was actually very informative and we learnt quite a bit. It could do with updating maybe but all the information is there.",
          "This small museum is a good little place to pass an hour or two if you want to learn a little bit about the history of cocoa and the role it has played in South American / Bolivian life. You get given a booklet in your chosen language and then walk around the various displays",
          "The cafe upstairs is nice, if you on the other hand want to know about the coca leaf or cocaine, try wikipedia, cheaper and better.",
          "It is a very small museum. Displays are informative, educative and provocative. It is worth a visit if you have an hour to spare.",
          "This small museum gave lots of info about the history of coca in Bolivia, its relationship with Coca Cola and present-day uses.",
          "Learn about the many uses of this sacred leaf! The guys who run the museum are helpful and enthusiastic. We tried a shot of the coca elixir and it set us right for exploding La Paz!",
          "A great trip through the history and current use of coca and the coca sweets that are available there to purchase are great, nothing like the green lollies you see in all the tourist shops and tienda's. An hour and 13 bolivian well spent.",
          "Not much to say, but it was interesting to know many facts about coca, from the local traditions to drug abuse and pharmaceutical use.",
          "small but very funny to visit. No photo. A good explanation of the \" system\". Coca is usually used. But \"concentrate\" is prohibited. The museum show the difficult way to do and the warm-full of the process. Coca is la like tea and chewing gum, no more for Bolivian. Cocaine",

          "The facts are somewhat interesting, albeit somewhat repetitive and out of date. Guaranteed you will learn something new about coca. The presentation is what makes it a bit of a boring thing to do (you are essentially given a 17 page essay about coca which may or may not",

          "You'd think that a museum devoted to a subject like this would find some way to make their presentation engaging and attractive, instead it's two small rooms and a back hallway papered with photographs and charts and such detailing the history of coca production and use for",
          "Enjoyable 40 mins and not expensive. Lots of reading and displays cramped but informative. Must visit in la paz but just don't expect to much really as its a cheap time filler",
          "Hard to guess what the take is, because they list some of the horrors of drug addiction, while at the same time advocating for the legal consumption of coca leaf, which IS legal already. Still, a pleasant enough place to kill an hour or two any given afternoon.",
          "Good exhibits and a wealth of knowledge about a completely mis understood plant. Remember, coca leaves are to cocaine like poppy seeds are to opium!",
          "What an informative little place!! Super tiny, but packed with information and pictures, definitely see this place! You will learn so many things you never thought could be true!! Only downsides - you can't take pictures inside and you need to know that the caf\u00e9 is not open",

          "For 11 Bolivianos it's hard to go wrong, but even if it were a bit more expensive, I'd still recommend going since coca plays such an important role in Bolivian culture. The museum itself is mostly text and pictures, but there's a cafe where you can try various products made",
          "Yeah, as others have said you probably could find all the info on the internet- but it would take you alot longer to compile the range of info they have, and you can't have a cocoa beer afterwards. Staff are really helpful and knowledgeable- well worth having a chat with them,",
          "We took the kids (don't, it is a lot of reading and nothing hands on but at least they were free). It is a small place and is mainly pics and descriptions in Spanish but you get a book in English that translates everything. 45 mins is adequate at most to wander round. OK if",
          "We expected something better. In fact it's a small place with mainly pictures attached to the walls and some sheets of paper explaining what the pictures present. If you don't speak Spanish, you need to read the same stuff from the book they give you at the reception. It can be",

          "This museum was in a run down building and they basically give you a readers manual on the history of coca leaves and you walk around the building with your manual and match the manual text/sections up with the pictures and history displayed on the walls. It was cheap to get in",

          "Coca is a great part of bolivian culture. They have been chewing it for thousands of years, and I thought this museum would teach me a great deal on it's importance and implications. It did, but it has some facts wrong, for example, the relationship between coca cola, cocaine",

          "The museum does what it is supposed to do; teach you about Coca. All posters throughout the museum are in Spanish but translations in many languages (including English, Dutch..) are available. Because you get a small book full of all information I just sat down and read through",

          "We visited the Museo de Coca after visiting the Witches Market earlier in day and this side trip filled an hour fairly easily. There was some interesting displays, and they provided translations free of charge. The writing was a little extensive at times, and the visual displays"

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country. In the year 1964 was a bad year, and it lost the category, playing the next year in the second category, but returning afterwards.The Strongest : Founded in 1908 the club hosts some of its games and trains on their home stadium named Rafael Mendoza after Don Rafael Mendoza, one of the most important presidents of the club. In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts that allowed the team to rise again as one of the most important in the country.\n\nLa Paz F.C. : Founded in 1989, the club quickly rose through the ranks to become the third major club in the capital, only behind in popularity to the two well-established city rivals.The city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:\n\nAcademia de Balompi\u00e9 Boliviano\nAlways Ready\nChaco Petrolero\nClub 31 de Octubre\nDeportivo Municipal de La Paz\nFraternidad Tigres\nMariscal Braun\nUniversitario de La Paz\nClub Uni\u00f3n MaestranzaWith the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Uni\u00f3n Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the Estadio Hernando Siles, which also hosts the national football team and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times. The palace has been restored many times since, but the name has remained untouched.\n\n\n=== Principal attractions ===\n\n\n==== Museums and cultural centers ====\n\nThe former home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, martyr of the independence revolution of 1809, has been preserved and is now a museum.

In March 2012, more than 1.5 million vehicles were registered. Heavy traffic is common in the city center and traffic jams occur on peak hours.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nThe La Paz-El Alto Highway is a toll road that connects the city of La Paz with the neighboring city of El Alto. It is the city's main highway. It allows easy access to El Alto International Airport. The highway runs 11,7 km and crosses the city of El Alto:\n\n Autopista La Paz-El Alto/RN-3 (La Paz-El Alto Highway) - Connects La Paz with El Alto.\n Autov\u00eda La Paz Oruro/A-1 (La Paz-Oruro Highway)  - Connects La Paz with the cities of Oruro, Patacamaya and Caracollo. It then connects with Ruta Nacional 1/RN-1 (National Highway 1) heading south to the cities of Potos\u00ed, Camargo, Tarija.The Southern District, one of La Paz's most affluent and commercial neighborhoods, is relatively separated from the rest of the city, including the CBD. The Avenida Costanera and Avenida Kantutani (Costanera and Kantutani Avenues) connect the southern district with the rest of the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nEl Alto International Airport (IATA code: LPB) is La Paz's national and international airport and a principal hub for L\u00ednea A\u00e9rea Amaszonas and Transporte A\u00e9reo Militar. It also serves as a focus city for Boliviana de Aviaci\u00f3n, Bolivia's flag-carrier and largest airline. The airport is located in the city of El Alto and is (13 km) south-west of La Paz's city center. At an elevation of 4,061 metres (13,323 feet), it is the highest international airport and fifth highest commercial airport in the world. The runway has a length of 4,000 metres (2.5 mi). It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport.\nInternational carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca, LATAM Airlines and Peruvian Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, Santiago and Cusco. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft.\nAirport facilities include ATMs, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, car rentals, duty-free shops, and free Wi-Fi internet. Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines.\nThere are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

          "Before you go anywhere else in the country, this museum will give you an excellent overview of Bolivian culture and history. Before you go textile shopping in Sag\u00e1rnaga street, you need to see their textile and lluchu (hats) collection to appreciate the artisan work behind it.",
          "Museum tells the history of the Andean clothing and cultural aspects. The temporary shows are also incredible. There is a Cafe downstairs also. A must go!",
          "Great display of ceremonial masks - very well done. The ceramics, textiles, metal-work and feathered costumes were also great. Sure, there is little interpretive signage in English, but what the heck, I just made it up!",
          "We went to MUSEF with my sister and brother-in-law. We took a very informative tour, which introduced us to Tiawanaku, a civilization that predated the Inca. Quite the surprise to us naive Americans. It led us to Tiawanaku, which is an archaeological site well worth a visit",
          "A wonderful museum; a must visit. I recommend to start here before even visiting the rest of the country. It will create a great awareness to the fabulous cultures, colors, archeology that will be found along the way. This museum is very well organized into several thematic",

          "Pursuing my long-term interest in ethnic textiles, culture and lifestyle, we spent two hours (although you could do it more quickly) in this very well curated small museum in the old centre of La Paz. There was an excellent room with examples of spinning and weaving equipment",
          "I went to this on the night of museums with a friend who I am interning with here (both ~20 yr old females), so it was relatively crowded, and we felt a little rushed. It was very good information about the history and culture of Bolivia. They have a little bit of everything.",
          "We visited this museum in April 2016. There was a play going on in the courtyard! (it was in Spanish, but you could get the idea that it was about corrupt priests and aristocracy). The building is itself very interesting (It seems to have been a home at one time). The",
          "I was amazed by the weaving collections and the Mask collection is amazing New Orleans Move over the gift shop has nice selection of quality well priced local craft",
          "We really enjoyed the permanent exhibits. From the textiles to the hats to the videos that helped elucidate the exhibits we had a fun time. We especially enjoyed the hats/headware exhibit. Well worth stopping in while in La Paz.",

          "This museum is in a converted mansion and contains three exhibits: textiles, masks and feather decoration. No photos are allowed inside the museum unless you pay an additional 20 Bolivianos (well worth it as you see such interesting & unusual things!). We had a local guide",
          "Let me be clear, museums are not a must in Bolivia, if you compare with the museums in Lima, or the Golden museum in Bogota or the Antropological in Mexico city, there is no comparison. Museums in La Paz are very basic and small. If you have 2 or more days in La Paz, take a walk",
          "Real goof representation of the local weavings and also of the folkloric cap's, costumes and their evolution as Morenada, Diablada and more. To get a good look you need at least one hour to visite",
          "From the woven textiles to the masks to the feather headdress amazing collection. The layout leads you from area to area. Yes there is mostly spanish labels but you are in a spanish speaking country that only in the last 10 years has been moving to a modern city. As more",
          "The entrance fee is 20b and a little more should you wish to take pictures. The museum is well designed and has great content, weave history, lots of really great woven hats through the years and an amazing display of masks. I spent around 1hr30min pottering. The information",
          "What a terrific museum, beautiful exhibits, we especially loved the masks and the gigantic feathered hats of the famous dancers. Nice little cafe at the exit too.",
          "This was a wonderful museeum-well curated and modern. The exhibit of masks from all over the country with explanations of their usage (dances, festivals, cultural context) was amazing. You could easily spend a couple of hours just in that section. The colonial street the museeum",
          "Because it was hard to find elsewhere, here are the museum hours: Monday-Friday: 9.00 am - 12.00 pm; 3.00 pm - 7.00 pm Saturday: 9.00 am - 4.30 pm Sunday: 9.00 am - 12.30 pm The museum is different from most I have encountered in other South American countries because its",

          "Well done, a small but lovely, clean and complete museum. A surprise find as it is a bit far away. Worth going...",
          "The exhibits in this museum should not be missed. While the museum is not often promoted, I would encourage you to go.",
          "This is a well curated museum, with lots of historical fabrics, pots, money and other objects to see. The highlight for us (and many others it seems) was the mask room, which not only presented a bunch of old masks, but did so in a very atmospheric room. Well worth the visit",
          "This is a pretty impressive museum, well presented, alot to see and the masks in the floor are worth a look. However I knock off two stars, one for Spanish only labels and another for the tiresome discriminatory of charging foreigners more 4 times in this case.",
          "I really liked this museum. I don't remember if they have much English descriptions but it's a really nice way to get to know a bit more about Bolivia. The visit really tweaked my interest in visit Tiwanaku. A pace\u00f1o friend of mine say its the best museum in town.",

          "A treat for anyone interested in Bolivian material culture. (And how could you not be?) Textiles, masks, ceramics, munecas, lovely shop, in a beautiful colonial building. Great cafe too!",
          "What I liked most was the display of masks from Bolivian dances, although few of them were very old. On the other hand, the pottery and carvings go back to the earliest known settlements. This is a very traditional, scholarly museum. Some of the descriptions were hard to read",
          "This is a very sleek and modern building on the outside, which is unexpected for the area. My favorite section was the textiles, as I love fabrics of any sort. Seeing how these textiles were made increases the respect you have for this form of artwork. The ceramics are also",
          "I went to MUSEF expecting to find a classic bolivian museum with everything old including the spaces you walk, but I was gladly impressed with a very modern space with a reaaly nice collection of Masks, Textiles, and numismatics. Looks like they have put a lot of effort in",
          "Superb collection of masks, textiles and other items. This fairly large place offers airy exhibition rooms and a modern way of throwing light on its great collections.",
          "This museum is near the central plaza and not to be missed. Having English titles would have made it excellent. There was a very unique feather exhibition, halls on ceramics (spoiled by not having dates!) and linens, a display of masks and finally a well-done chronological trip",
          "Nice building, very interesting exhibitions about Andean ceramics, textiles and masks. It is also a nice place to visit for those interested in Pre-Columbian cultures.",
          "I really don't like to write about museums but this one had such a great masks (you cant take the photos) in a dark room, so it is one of those museum that I remember and that I can recommend.",

          "Impressive collection of ancient fabrics really brings to life the vibrant and creative capabilities of the Andean weavers. Also has great section on pre-Incan civlizaiton at Tiwanaku. For $20 bolivian it's worth it.",
          "On a sunny, quiet Sunday morning, this is a wonderful way to immerse yourself in a part of Bolivian history you might not have thought of experiencing. I was interested in the history of traditional weaving and the museum did not disappoint. I asked if they sell the video that",
          "The museum has a great collection of carnival masks, tribal head wear made out of feathers, pottery,weaving and a section on the history of the Bolivian currency. The cost of entry was 20 Bolivianos.",

          "Visit it before to meet people of Bolivia. You can after understand the traditional hat of women, the Christan influence on local way of dressing.. very important !. The Spanish \"influence \" on this great civilization is terrible. All part of way of live. after the visit",
          "a comprehensive guide to the different cultures of la paz, well displayed, not many people, the mask room was fantastic as was the head-dress room. The cafe next door is a good place for lunch and the gift shop was first class",
          "If it is raining in la paz, or if you just have some time left, it is a good idea to visit this museum. It is not a must, but it has some interesting things, especially the weavings and the masks.",
          "They have a great textile exhibit, and good short term expositions. I is truly amazing what intricate weavings people of the past could do.",
          "I was most impressed by the textile portion of this museum. My wife and I spent about 3 hours in this museum. We are not big textile people but we really enjoyed reading about the different designs and spent a long time looking at the drawers of different textiles in the first",
          "This a very nice museum with a small collection of interesting textiles, pottery, feather arts, and masks. If you like these sorts of things, then you will enjoy this museum. Like most visitors, the mask exhibit was my favourite part. I did think that the price of 20 Bs was a",
          "This is a must see museum. We showed up 30 minutes before closing and therefore had to visit each room quickly, but I will definitely go back next time in La Paz. Their is an artfully lit Mask hall with an amazing selection of traditional masks from all Bolivian cultures. The",

          "Especially if you're into the handicrafts of Bolivia. Several great exhibits of textiles, masks, ceramics and their use of feathers in hats. They have great videos showing how the different peoples used these things. It's not worth paying the extra 20B. Other people said it was",

          "I enjoyed this museum. Unfortunately, I don't read Spanish very well, and there is no English translations. However, the museum is still a very fun place to go. They have ancient textiles and ceramics, but I definitely enjoyed the extremely cool room of masks the best (although",
          "We visited the museum as it had been highly recommended. We weren't really sure if folklore was our thing but thoroughly enjoyed the viist. Entrance was 20BOB each and 10BOB to use a camera - which is well worth it, particularly for the display of masks which are really great",
          "If you have only one museum to do in La Paz, this is the \"one\". 25 soles for the entry ticket plus 25 soles for the camera. It is worth paying for the camera especially for the mask collection that you can take in picture!!",

          "This museum's entrance is in a beautiful colonial building. You look around several different themed sections, for example pottery, currency, masks and costumes. One of the things I really liked weas the way it is laid out so you can see things easily. I also liked the way they",
          "While we had planned to see this museum anyway, when we actually went we mostly did it as a way to escape the rain for an hour. Or so we thought, because we ended up staying much longer than that. Not only is the building itself beautiful (at least the old part), but there's a",
          "The collections of ceramics and masks are great. Te mask exhibit really shows how the Bolivian culture celebrates festivities over the years and still does. Three floors of exhibits so expect to spend a couple of hours here.",

          "We were a little disappointed after reading the reviews, for one thing the museum is no longer free (5 bolivianos for nationals, 15 for extranjeros), and according to my Bolivian friend had much less to show than in the past. She said they are charging more for less. Still,",
          "The museum is not very big but worth visiting. Especialy the 1st floor is very stunning. The room with traditional dancing masks is the best of the museum. It is not a standard Bolivian museum; the lighting is mysterious and in every room there is a video explaining the subject."

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country. In the year 1964 was a bad year, and it lost the category, playing the next year in the second category, but returning afterwards.The Strongest : Founded in 1908 the club hosts some of its games and trains on their home stadium named Rafael Mendoza after Don Rafael Mendoza, one of the most important presidents of the club. In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts that allowed the team to rise again as one of the most important in the country.\n\nLa Paz F.C. : Founded in 1989, the club quickly rose through the ranks to become the third major club in the capital, only behind in popularity to the two well-established city rivals.The city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:\n\nAcademia de Balompi\u00e9 Boliviano\nAlways Ready\nChaco Petrolero\nClub 31 de Octubre\nDeportivo Municipal de La Paz\nFraternidad Tigres\nMariscal Braun\nUniversitario de La Paz\nClub Uni\u00f3n MaestranzaWith the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Uni\u00f3n Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the Estadio Hernando Siles, which also hosts the national football team and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times. The palace has been restored many times since, but the name has remained untouched.\n\n\n=== Principal attractions ===\n\n\n==== Museums and cultural centers ====\n\nThe former home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, martyr of the independence revolution of 1809, has been preserved and is now a museum.

In March 2012, more than 1.5 million vehicles were registered. Heavy traffic is common in the city center and traffic jams occur on peak hours.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nThe La Paz-El Alto Highway is a toll road that connects the city of La Paz with the neighboring city of El Alto. It is the city's main highway. It allows easy access to El Alto International Airport. The highway runs 11,7 km and crosses the city of El Alto:\n\n Autopista La Paz-El Alto/RN-3 (La Paz-El Alto Highway) - Connects La Paz with El Alto.\n Autov\u00eda La Paz Oruro/A-1 (La Paz-Oruro Highway)  - Connects La Paz with the cities of Oruro, Patacamaya and Caracollo. It then connects with Ruta Nacional 1/RN-1 (National Highway 1) heading south to the cities of Potos\u00ed, Camargo, Tarija.The Southern District, one of La Paz's most affluent and commercial neighborhoods, is relatively separated from the rest of the city, including the CBD. The Avenida Costanera and Avenida Kantutani (Costanera and Kantutani Avenues) connect the southern district with the rest of the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nEl Alto International Airport (IATA code: LPB) is La Paz's national and international airport and a principal hub for L\u00ednea A\u00e9rea Amaszonas and Transporte A\u00e9reo Militar. It also serves as a focus city for Boliviana de Aviaci\u00f3n, Bolivia's flag-carrier and largest airline. The airport is located in the city of El Alto and is (13 km) south-west of La Paz's city center. At an elevation of 4,061 metres (13,323 feet), it is the highest international airport and fifth highest commercial airport in the world. The runway has a length of 4,000 metres (2.5 mi). It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport.\nInternational carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca, LATAM Airlines and Peruvian Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, Santiago and Cusco. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft.\nAirport facilities include ATMs, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, car rentals, duty-free shops, and free Wi-Fi internet. Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines.\nThere are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

        "wiki": "La Recoleta Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio de la Recoleta) is a cemetery located in the Recoleta neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. It contains the graves of notable people, including Eva Per\u00f3n, presidents of Argentina, Nobel Prize winners, the founder of the Argentine Navy, and a granddaughter of Napoleon. In 2011, the BBC hailed it as one of the world's best cemeteries, and in 2013, CNN listed it among the 10 most beautiful cemeteries in the world.\n\n\n== History ==\nFranciscan Recollect monks (los recoletos) arrived in this area, then the outskirts of Buenos Aires, in the early eighteenth century. The cemetery is built around the Recollect Convent (Convento de la Recoleta) and a church, Our Lady of Pilar (Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar), built in 1732.  \nThe order was disbanded in 1822, and the garden of the convent was converted into the first public cemetery in Buenos Aires. Inaugurated on 17 November of the same year under the name of Cementerio del Norte (Northern Cemetery), those responsible for its creation were the then-Governor Martin Rodr\u00edguez, who would be eventually buried in the cemetery, and government minister Bernardino Rivadavia.The 1822 layout was done by French civil engineer Pr\u00f3spero Catelin, who also designed the current facade of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral. The cemetery was last remodeled in 1881, while Torcuato de Alvear was mayor of the city, by the Italian architect Juan Antonio Buschiazzo.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSet in 5.5 hectares (14 acres), the site contains 4691 vaults, all above ground, of which 94 have been declared National Historical Monuments by the Argentine government and are protected by the state. The entrance to the cemetery is through neo-classical gates with tall Doric columns. The cemetery contains many elaborate marble mausoleums, decorated with statues, in a wide variety of architectural styles such as Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Baroque, and Neo-Gothic, and most materials used between 1880 and 1930 in the construction of tombs were imported from Paris and Milan. The entire cemetery is laid out in sections like city blocks, with wide tree-lined main walkways branching into sidewalks filled with mausoleums. These mausoleums are still being used by rich families in Argentina that have their own vault and keep their deceased there. \nWhile many of the mausoleums are in fine shape and well-maintained, others have fallen into disrepair. Several can be found with broken glass and littered with rubbish. Among many memorials are works by notable Argentine sculptors, Lola Mora and Luis Perlotti for instance. The tomb of Liliana Crociati de Szaszak, due to its unusual design, is of special interest.\n\n\n== Notable interments ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It consists of an area where erosion has worn away the majority of a mountain, composed primarily of clay rather than rock, leaving tall spires.  It is similar to another zone of La Paz that is known as El Valle de las Animas (The Valley of the Souls). It is an important site of the famous holiday, Dias de los Muertos (Day of the Dead).Because the mineral content of the mountains varies greatly between individual mountains, the sides of the mountains are different colors, creating striking optical illusions. A majority of them are a clear beige or light brown color, but some are almost red, with sections of dark violet.\n\n\n== See also ==\nValle de la Luna, Potos\u00ed, Bolivia (El Sillar)",

        "wiki": "Laguna Niguel () is a  city in Orange County, California in the United States. The name Laguna Niguel is derived from the words \"Laguna\" (Spanish for \"lagoon\") and \"Niguili\" (the name of a Native American village once located near Aliso Creek). As of the 2010 census, the population was 62,979. Laguna Niguel is located in the San Joaquin Hills in the southeastern corner of Orange County, close to the Pacific Ocean, and borders the cities of Aliso Viejo, Dana Point, Laguna Beach, Laguna Hills, Mission Viejo, and San Juan Capistrano.\nLaguna Niguel has its origins in the Rancho Niguel Mexican land grant, which was acquired in 1959 by the Laguna Niguel Corporation to develop one of California's first master-planned communities. As a predominantly residential city, Laguna Niguel serves as a bedroom community for the job centers of northern and central Orange County. Laguna Niguel has a median household income 31 percent above the Orange County average and nearly double the U.S. average. It is known for its mild coastal climate, low crime rate, and its numerous parks and public trails.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early inhabitants and settlers ===\nThe first recorded inhabitants of the Laguna Niguel area were the Acjachemem Native Americans, who may have had a village called \"Niguili\" near the confluence of Aliso Creek and Sulphur Creek. Aliso Creek marked the boundary between the Acjachemem and Tongva people. In the 1700s, during the Spanish colonization of the Americas, Spanish missionaries established the nearby Mission San Juan Capistrano to convert the Acjachemem (called the Jua\u00f1eno by the Spanish) to Christianity. The Mission lands, which included the present-day boundaries of Laguna Niguel, were divided into private land grants in 1821 upon Mexico's independence from Spain.\nIn 1842, the 13,316-acre (5,389 ha) Rancho Niguel was granted to Juan Avila; he retained ownership of the land through the Mexican\u2013American War (when California became part of the United States) until 1865, when a severe drought forced him into bankruptcy. In 1895 Lewis Moulton and Jean Pierre Daguerre bought the Rancho Niguel and other portions of the surrounding area from farmers who were struggling due to persistent drought conditions. The Moulton Company was established to oversee 19,000 acres (7,700 ha) of local land which was used, mainly for orchards and sheep ranching, well into the mid-20th century. In 1951 the land was divided between the Moulton and Daguerre families, the latter inheriting 8,056 acres (3,260 ha) in the future location of Laguna Niguel. In 1954 the Daguerres sold 7,200 acres (2,900 ha) to the Shumaker Group and 856 acres (346 ha) of oceanfront to George Capron, a former Major League Baseball player who established the Capron Ranch.\n\n\n=== Laguna Niguel Corporation ===\n\nThe completion of Interstate 5 in 1959 enabled easy access to job centers in Los Angeles County, creating a boom in the Orange County housing market. In 1959, Cabot, Cabot & Forbes and Paine Webber partnered to form the Laguna Niguel Corporation, which purchased the Daguerre land to develop one of California's first master planned communities. The initial 7,100-acre (2,900 ha) town plan was created by Viennese architect Victor Gruen and expanded beginning in 1971 by AVCO Community Developers after they acquired the Laguna Niguel Corporation. The name of the city was created from \"Laguna\", a reference to the tidal lagoon that once formed at the mouth of Aliso Creek, and the name of the Acjachemem village Niguili that once occupied the area. As the city would be developed in stages, ranchers and farmers signed annual leases with the Laguna Niguel Corporation to use the land until the planned communities were built.\nIn contrast to a traditional bedroom community, Laguna Niguel was designed so that \"families should have most of their economic needs and their social and cultural interests met by facilities within the community\". The plan was also notable for its emphasis on parks and open space \u2013 comprising nearly a third of the land to be developed. The Laguna Niguel Corporation went public in April 1959 and raised an initial $8.2 million from investors. In 1962 the first tracts of Monarch Bay and Niguel Terrace were completed, consisting of 565 homes. In 1960, the Moulton Niguel Water District (which today serves all of Laguna Niguel) was established by a conglomerate of ranchers, to import water from the Colorado River Aqueduct as the area lacked a sufficient natural water supply. In 1964, Crown Valley Parkway was completed from I-5 to the Pacific Coast Highway, facilitating transport through the growing city. By 1965 the population of Laguna Niguel reached 1,000.\n\nThe Laguna Niguel Homeowner's Association was formed in 1966 as an advisory to the Orange County Board of Supervisors (which governed the as-yet unincorporated city). In 1973 Laguna Niguel Regional Park opened to the public. The Chet Holifield Federal Building (a local landmark popularly known as the \"Ziggurat\"), designed by William L. Pereira, was constructed for Rockwell International and was meant to bring 7,000 jobs to the area. After the end of the Vietnam War, Rockwell reportedly lost a defense contract with the federal government and the building was left unoccupied. It was eventually traded to the US General Services Administration in exchange for industrial facilities elsewhere.The Ziggurat, which was completed in 1971 well before the development of residential communities in the area, is one of Laguna Niguel's most noticeable landmarks. The Orange County Register described it as \"the only constant in an ever developing locale.\" It houses millions of microfilms as documents of land agreements between the American government and Native American tribes of the southwest United States. It is also home to the Western Regional Department of Homeland Security and the California Service Center of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. The building was featured in an ending scene for the 1975 sci-fi movie Death Race 2000 and as the headquarters for the Luckup Corporation in the 1983 movie Deal of the Century. It was also used for the 1995 movie Outbreak, where it served as the exterior for the Centers for Disease Control headquarters.\n\n\n=== Incorporation and conflict with Dana Point ===\nIn 1965 the Laguna Niguel Corporation had purchased George Capron's oceanfront property and began to develop the Niguel Shores neighborhood, known in its early days as the \"Coastal Strip\" and today as Monarch Beach. By the 1970s the as-yet unincorporated Dana Point began expressing interest in annexing the Niguel Shores area; in 1977 Dana Point briefly proposed incorporation with Laguna Niguel as a single city. Both cities submitted incorporation requests in December 1986, when a controversy immediately erupted over the coastal Monarch Beach community. Although Monarch Beach had been developed by the Laguna Niguel Corporation, its residents voted 61 percent in favor of joining with Dana Point. Laguna Niguel filed a lawsuit, which was ultimately turned down by a judge. Laguna Niguel was formally incorporated on December 1, 1989, without the coastal strip, as Orange County's 29th city.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\n\nThe population increased quickly during the last few decades of the 20th century, from 12,237 in 1980 to 61,891 in 2000. Growth since 2000 has been slower, with an estimate of 65,806 in 2015, due to the fact that the city has been fully built out. In 1992, Alicia Parkway was completed to I-5, providing a shorter route for northbound commuters; in 1996 the 73 San Joaquin Hills toll road opened, linking Laguna Niguel to the Interstate 405 in Costa Mesa. The Laguna Niguel City Hall, which had been planned as early as 1989, finally opened on October 15, 2011.In 1994 local residents first noticed damage to retaining walls and roads near an artificial slope in the Niguel Summit community, and geologists warned that the area could be subject to a landslide. After heavy rains caused by the 1997\u201398 Super El Ni\u00f1o, the hill collapsed on March 19, 1998, destroying four homes at the top and five condominium units at the bottom. Fortuitously, there were no deaths as the area had been evacuated only a few hours prior to the collapse. An investigation revealed that the company responsible for development, J.M. Peters Inc., had improperly packed and graded the 275,000 tons of fill supporting the Niguel Summit homes. In addition, the project had been plagued by instability throughout its construction, and halted repeatedly \"after complaints of mudslides, slope washouts, erosion and dust.\" The Los Angeles Times reported that \"according to county records, the developers were warned that building on \"ancient landslides\" could be unsafe, but they were able to continue construction after producing their own geological report that persuaded county officials to let the project go forward.\"\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLaguna Niguel is located at 33\u00b031\u203255\u2033N 117\u00b042\u20329\u2033W (33.531938, \u2212117.702503). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 14.9 square miles (39 km2). 14.8 square miles (38 km2) of it is land and 0.05 square miles (0.13 km2) of it (0.35%) is water.\nLaguna Niguel consists of mostly hilly terrain, being located within the San Joaquin Hills. The average elevation is 400 feet (120 m); elevations range from near sea level to 936 feet (285 m) at the summit of Niguel Hill, in the southwest corner of the city. Neighboring cities are  Aliso Viejo and Laguna Hills to the north, Mission Viejo and San Juan Capistrano to the east, and Laguna Beach and Dana Point to the south. On the west, it borders the significant unincorporated acreage of Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park.The main watercourses in Laguna Niguel are Salt Creek, which flows through the southern part of the city, and Sulphur Creek, which drains much of the northern half. Sulphur Creek is a tributary of Aliso Creek, which flows through the wide and deep Aliso Canyon before reaching the Pacific Ocean. Laguna Niguel Lake, formed by damming Sulphur Creek, is the largest body of water in the city. Although Laguna Niguel is located very close to the Pacific, it does not border it, the result of a controversy over the coastline with Dana Point in 1989 (see #History).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike much of coastal Southern California, Laguna Niguel has pleasant weather year-round. On average, August is the hottest month and December the coolest. The highest recorded temperature was 108 \u00b0F (42 \u00b0C), which occurred in 1963, and the lowest temperature was 21 \u00b0F (\u22126 \u00b0C), which was recorded in 1949. Precipitation is sparse in Laguna Niguel, as only five months out of the year receive rainfall greater than one inch, with an annual average of 14.2 inches (360 mm). The highest monthly rainfall on average occurs in February and is 3.4 inches (86 mm).\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nLaguna Niguel is home to many upscale neighborhoods including Bear Brand Ranch, El Niguel Heights and Golf Course, Ocean Ranch, Laguna Crest, Laguna Woods, Laguna Sur. Coronado Pointe,\nSouth Peak, Crest de Ville, Niguel Coast, Palmilla, Beacon Hill, and Monarch Point, which offer city, canyon, and ocean views. Other key neighborhoods include Rancho Niguel, Marina Hills, Niguel West, Niguel Summit, Kite Hill, and San Joaquin Hills.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Laguna Niguel had a population of 62,979.

Over one-third of Laguna Niguel is public open space, a legacy of the original 1959 Gruen plan, and is divided between 31 city parks and 4 county parks. Laguna Niguel's major roads are designated as \"scenic highways\" within landscape corridors, which includes parks, decorative medians, and grade-separated recreational paths. The 227-acre (92 ha) Laguna Niguel Regional Park is centrally located and includes an extensive trail network, ball courts and Laguna Niguel Lake, a popular fishing and boating venue. Crown Valley Park, visited by about 240,000 people per year, has the city's main public sports facilities. Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park, which borders Laguna Niguel on the west, consists of over 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) of canyons, grasslands and riparian forests along Aliso Creek. Aliso and Wood Canyons is part of the larger South Coast Wilderness, 22,000 acres (8,900 ha) of preserved open space in the San Joaquin Hills that also includes the larger Laguna Coast Wilderness Park and Crystal Cove State Park outside the city limits. The interconnected city and regional park systems provide a significant refuge for wildlife in an area of Orange County otherwise filled with suburban sprawl.There are about 80 miles (130 km) of non-motorized trails in Laguna Niguel for hiking, biking and horseback riding. Major hiking trails include the Aliso Summit trail, which hugs the rim of Aliso Canyon on the western edge of Laguna Niguel, and the Colinas Bluff Trail on the eastern border, overlooking San Juan Capistrano. The Laguna Ridge Trail passes through Badlands County Park, which exposes the namesake geological formations, and approaches the summit of Niguel Hill, the highest point in the city. The paved Salt Creek Trail, a popular Class I bikeway, follows Salt Creek and Niguel Road from Dana Point to Laguna Niguel Regional Park. The Aliso Creek and Oso Creek trails are mostly outside Laguna Niguel, but link the city via greenbelts to other parts of south Orange County. The Aliso Creek Trail is also known as the \"Forest to the Sea Trail\", as it is planned to connect the Santa Ana Mountains in the Cleveland National Forest to the Pacific Ocean at Laguna Beach.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nErik Apple, mixed martial arts fighter\nGavyn Bailey, singer-songwriter\nPatricia Bates, California State Senate\nMcKayla Maroney, 2012 London Olympics medalist\nCady McClain, actress, singer and author\nTimmy Moreno, former bassist of metalcore band SeeYouSpaceCowboy \nFrank Rosenthal, professional gambler, former casino boss, and reputed Chicago Outfit associate whose life was partially depicted in Martin Scorsese's 1995 film Casino\nMimi Walters, U.S. House of Representatives\nRachel Wood, soccer player\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n Al Qaim, Iraq\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country. In the year 1964 was a bad year, and it lost the category, playing the next year in the second category, but returning afterwards.The Strongest : Founded in 1908 the club hosts some of its games and trains on their home stadium named Rafael Mendoza after Don Rafael Mendoza, one of the most important presidents of the club. In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts that allowed the team to rise again as one of the most important in the country.\n\nLa Paz F.C. : Founded in 1989, the club quickly rose through the ranks to become the third major club in the capital, only behind in popularity to the two well-established city rivals.The city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:\n\nAcademia de Balompi\u00e9 Boliviano\nAlways Ready\nChaco Petrolero\nClub 31 de Octubre\nDeportivo Municipal de La Paz\nFraternidad Tigres\nMariscal Braun\nUniversitario de La Paz\nClub Uni\u00f3n MaestranzaWith the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Uni\u00f3n Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the Estadio Hernando Siles, which also hosts the national football team and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times. The palace has been restored many times since, but the name has remained untouched.\n\n\n=== Principal attractions ===\n\n\n==== Museums and cultural centers ====\n\nThe former home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, martyr of the independence revolution of 1809, has been preserved and is now a museum.

In March 2012, more than 1.5 million vehicles were registered. Heavy traffic is common in the city center and traffic jams occur on peak hours.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nThe La Paz-El Alto Highway is a toll road that connects the city of La Paz with the neighboring city of El Alto. It is the city's main highway. It allows easy access to El Alto International Airport. The highway runs 11,7 km and crosses the city of El Alto:\n\n Autopista La Paz-El Alto/RN-3 (La Paz-El Alto Highway) - Connects La Paz with El Alto.\n Autov\u00eda La Paz Oruro/A-1 (La Paz-Oruro Highway)  - Connects La Paz with the cities of Oruro, Patacamaya and Caracollo. It then connects with Ruta Nacional 1/RN-1 (National Highway 1) heading south to the cities of Potos\u00ed, Camargo, Tarija.The Southern District, one of La Paz's most affluent and commercial neighborhoods, is relatively separated from the rest of the city, including the CBD. The Avenida Costanera and Avenida Kantutani (Costanera and Kantutani Avenues) connect the southern district with the rest of the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nEl Alto International Airport (IATA code: LPB) is La Paz's national and international airport and a principal hub for L\u00ednea A\u00e9rea Amaszonas and Transporte A\u00e9reo Militar. It also serves as a focus city for Boliviana de Aviaci\u00f3n, Bolivia's flag-carrier and largest airline. The airport is located in the city of El Alto and is (13 km) south-west of La Paz's city center. At an elevation of 4,061 metres (13,323 feet), it is the highest international airport and fifth highest commercial airport in the world. The runway has a length of 4,000 metres (2.5 mi). It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport.\nInternational carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca, LATAM Airlines and Peruvian Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, Santiago and Cusco. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft.\nAirport facilities include ATMs, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, car rentals, duty-free shops, and free Wi-Fi internet. Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines.\nThere are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

          "This iconic church is a place of refuge from a crowded square in front of it. The wall-to-wall main altar is a riot of gold with an assortment of uniquely Bolivian santos. The church also boasts La Paz's best rooftop view which is only accessible if you buy a ticket to the",
          "The architecture of this church is very interesting in that it combined religious Catholic statues alongside indigenous symbols. For a small charge you can walk up to the top of the bell tower for a great view of the city.",
          "This was the starting point of our walking tour. The outside is more impressive than the interior. 10 mins inside was more than enough time to look round.",
          "Nice and interesting for a short visit. Not so different from many other churches nd cathedrals in South America. Visit if within walking distance or a short cab ride, but not worth a long trip just to visit this place.",
          "Interesting church to have a look at. It is useful to get a guide to help you understand and appreciate some of the intricacies and stories behind the building, as well as how the religious developed. Follow my #30somethinggapyear on Instagram @DatLoongJourney.",
          "When you visit a foreign city, particularly like somewhere in Central or South America, there are a certain number of buildings to see - palaces, government buildings, cathedrals, etc. This is one of those in La Paz. St Francis seems to be a popular saint in this neck of the",
          "Although you don't get to stand in the actual sanctuary, you do see a lot of the church and the surrounding buildings. Don't miss a visit to the bell tower and roof, if you don't mind narrow passageways.",
          "The truth is difficult to contemplate in its entirety. The structure is made of stone and its history is worth remembering. If you are wearing a hat",
          "Entry ticket included a guide, however you might get a uni student whose English is not very fluent. Interesting history of the cathedral and Franciscan monks. Worth climbing up the steep narrow staircase to the bell towers that offers nice view of surrounding and interesting",
          "My husband and I visited the museum attached to the church as our first stop in La Paz. I can't remember the cost, but I know it was low. The rooms in the convent contained paintings and historical information (all in Spanish). There was no one to offer a tour in English,",
          "well worth a stroll through to see the beautiful main and side altars. Was reverent and respectful as Mass was being celebrated. Obviously not as opulent as the churches and cathedrals in Europe.",
          "We've taken an English tour of the church. The lady is an extremely experienced one who can manage to show us all important features of the church in a 40 minutes tour. However, the tour is a bit too short and we think it should take 1.5 hour to finish reading all those",
          "The museum offers many rooms with detailed explanations of the history of the building & the Spanish influence in La Paz.",
          "An artistic and architectural jewel. Incredible structure in the city. Good memories in adjacent stores.",
          "Is one of the the principal churches in lapaz and a really enjoyed the place the museum is great! With guides, nice place to go for small history.",
          "Originally founded in 1548 as the Convent of San Francisco followed by the church in 1549. Rebuilt in the mid 1750s the current baroque mestizo style church still stands and is a minor basilica. For a reasonable entrance fee, I received an individualized and comprehensive tour",
          "The Church is beautiful, but when we went on a tour (20 b) we didn\u2019t learn anything due to a stressed guide. But if you\u2019re happy with just the interior- go!",
          "Very interesting temple, outside amazing figure ( people , dragons animals , plants) old door , baroque style. Inside simply with many altars on the right and left sides. Photo - prohibited .",
          "When we purchased tickets the staff said there would be English guide available, but when we walked up the stairs to start the tour, the staff there said there won't be any English guide. We walked by ourselves for a while until we bumped into a group of German tourists being",
          "Sadly no photos but this building is very different to the cathedral which is mord in European style. The altar is gold replica. A huge full wall. There are statues and paintings in the native style and as our guide indicated represents a polytheistic belief system totally",
          "This is well worth a visit, it has a lovely peaceful atmosphere and is a beautiful building. Shame about the hideous tower blocks all around it.",
          "We visited Iglesias de San Francisco and were in absolute awe. Very well preserved and full of historic items thoughtful displayed. It was like a walk back through time. We would highly recommend visiting this Historic Site in La Paz. Well worth the time and money spent. Easy to",
          "When I arrived at the church, early afternoon, I was told it was not open to the public until 6:00 PM. However, the church museum was open and admission is cheap. I was accompanied by an English speaking guide (although her command of English was rather rudimentary). I climbed",
          "Very old rustic church, absolutely breathtaking on the inside well worth a visit. The day we visited it was decorated with hundreds of flowers!",
          "I\u2019m not catholic, but I can appreciate all the fantastic structures they have built and this one is impressive. Be warned, you are not supposed to take pictures inside . . . Oops! I didn\u2019t see the sign until we were on our way out.",
          "We passed by on the Saturday but it was closed only the museum was open, we did pass by again on Sunday and we were able to catch a mass which was very touching The church itself was very pretty.",
          "Watch for pickpockets, but it is an interesting structure to visit. Lots of people congregate in the general area.",
          "The outside is a reminder of Spanish colonialism and the architecture exquisite. It's not opulent like what I saw in Italy but it's massive and simple in structure. Inside it's a very much a daily practicing church where local devotees spend much time. Very very cool. It's",
          "The church is not as impressive as its counterpart in Lima, but the tours provide great insights and take you up the bell tower. The guide we had spoke french, and was very knowledgeable. It is even amazing to see that there are still monks living there",
          "We went for the Sunday mass, goes on every hour 7:00 to 11:00 AM. Unfortunately the guides only works Monday to Saturday, we will like to know more about the history. Even with aren't in too a mass worth the visit to see the Spanish conquers power.",
          "It's a toss up as to whether the cathedral of the San Francisco church is the more stunning highlight of La Paz. The SF church is more accessible in terms of opening times, but photography is completely forbidden inside. The architecture isn't as impressive as the cathedral, but",
          "Visting the church after 1600 is free and one can take a leisurely look around the stunning interior bearing in mind that photographs are strictly prohibited. The craftsmanship and dedication that has created the carvings and facade are staggeringly good. To view the monastery",
          "This is arguably the most famous Plaza in La Paz. It's nice, but not impressive when compared to many of the famous plazas of the world. I certainly would not go out of my way to visit this place. But if you're in La Paz and have some free time, it's probably worth stopping",
          "Once you enter to the Musuem you start to like it, the guide was very nice and helpfull!!! The paintings are beautiful!!!",
          "The tour is good, and they have tour guides that do it in English. A tour of about 30 minutes. A little expensive bit worth it if you don't mind being bossed around for that length of time.",
          "If you're staying near the church of San Francisco this is a good place to plan your day after breakfast while people watching.",
          "I usually don't go to churches but I was there with my father and, beside he goes to church, we needed a place to rest! Lol We got there at the end of the Sunday worship and it was nice. They had a choir and people were singing and actively participating. I was raised as",
          "Went in to church on a Sunday as it was the only day it was open while I was in town, managed to attend mass which was interesting in itself",
          "The church is beautiful and worth a visit. The city square there is very popular. The mime clown is fun, as well as the Michael Jackson impersonator. Lots of actives and vendors. Great area.",
          "You can't miss this church; it is the epicenter of the city. Lots of people and activity. Church is unique example of baroque mestizo style.",
          "Nice old church that seemed to be the center of local activity. There are lots of vendors in the area",
          "Unusual church blending the county's cultural traditions both inside and out but especially on the fa\u00e7ade. If not to everyone's taste, full of interest and well worth a brief visit.",
          "We enjoyed an English speaking guided tour through this incredibly historical building and got a nice view of the main square. The tour takes you through tight stairways and if you're lucky, to the script. Fantastic way to spend an hour.",
          "Good way to spend about hour our guide juan alegandro made the tour very interesting and was free as part of the entry fee worth a visit",
          "The Church can be visited by simply entering it, when it is open, but the adjacent museum enables the visitor to see its Franciscan Convent as well as the Bell Tower and various other nooks of the complex. The Mestizo Baroque architecture is of special interest",
          "We really enjoyed this tour of the cathedral. The church is very old and since it was built clergy have lived here (still do). There and a few rooms where you really sense how it might have been to live here 300 years ago - and how oppressive the colonial morality was. We had",
          "The building is a real gem. My only complaint is that you can only wander around as part of a guided tour, and our guide pushed us through at a brisk pace. I would have liked to take more time. I presume the tour is due to the meandering nature of the building. Parts are closed",
          "The church is beautiful inside and out, it was very touching to be there during a mass and hear the voices raised in song filling the space, I'd go back to lion around more as I didn't like to during worship. The museum however is a disappointment - it costs 20bol to get in, a",
          "The english guide on the museum.. Oh dear lord! Well, he didn't speak good English, I didn't mind that but he was so scared and embarrassed about that so he practically ran the place through and on the way just pointed up the objects and said a few words about them. The",
          "The museum and the church are definitely worth a visit. The church is not accesible at all times of the day but if it's open it's worth a visit to see the beautiful altar and have a look at the crypts.",
          "Located at the crossing of Sagarnaga and Murillo streets, in the back of the plaza with the same name, Iglesia de San Francisco is perhaps the oldest in the country. Construction started in 1548, before the founding of the city of La Paz, it then collapsed in 1612 and built",
          "Well worth the visit. It's a beautiful church measuring up to those in Europe. The detailing on both the interior and exterior is incredible",
          "Make your way here and then head off up the many laneways and explore the old City . The Church has lots of activity outside as well as the usual views inside",
          "The architrcture is a combination of european and indiginous...so it is a beautiful unique church...no doubt But whats more excited are activities at the front...such as chess tables and street concert",
          "One of the Most Important buildings in La Paz and a unique architecture and facade-decoration! Note the floral motives and the inca-faces there! And never forget to say a prayer for the Peoples of Bolivia!",
          "This is a historic church built upon the peace between the rich spaniards and mestizos and the poor indigens The church is nice and classical; however it has been partially restored and in the process some of the charm went away to be replaced by glitterness",
          "This is a really lovely church in the middle of crazy and busy La Paz - worth a visit even if you're not catholic or religious.",
          "The monastery is interesting to visit and there is a nice view from the roof and bell towers. The guided tour provided only basic information and was only in Spanish though they do have alternate tours in English. The information delivered was pretty basic though, and provided",
          "Nice church on a busy square where everyone tries to sell anything. Very close to the touristic Sganaga street.",
          "Me and my friend are Australian and we visited this church today and not only did Daniel fill us with knowledge we had a good laugh together highly recommend for a fantastic experience! Muchas gracias Daniel & San Francisco!! Two proper legends",
          "Beautiful building and a lovely town square adjacent. Exterior architecture is stunning, the solemn dark interior is incredibly interesting. Worth a 30 minute stop.",
          "Cool place to visit, I must for all those visiting La Paz. Here you will see the San Francisco Church, loved the architecture of this church with Mestizo and Baroque influences.",
          "A busy square where everyone collects. Watch your valuables. Church is old and great to take photos of.",
          "You won't believe there is a place hidden in the middle of such trafic noise. San Francisco Church and Museum is worth to visit. There are guided tours and is cheap. You can visit the church and museum just in 30 minutes and climb until the bell tower to enjoy a beautifull",
          "La Paz' oldest church and convent, if I'm not mistaken. Beautiful mestizo decorations on the front and the altar. Also have a look at the museum and the rooftop walk is not to be missed.",
          "Don't miss this attraction. Take your time in the church. The inside of the church might be frightening to young children. My son did find the decorations scary but this is a must see in La Paz.",
          "What a fantastic example of baroque in America. The altares and pulpits are beautiful! You should not miss this place!",
          "It is a gorgeous Church, the architecture and design is very intriguing and appeals to all. The only thing is that on week days they open at 4;00PM, but other than than, well worth it",
          "The best way to see the church is taking the museum tour. The church is more than just a church it's a convent. In old times it used to be a larger convent to which lay people where not allowed.. Now you can see parts of it. The climb to the roof is worth it! Enjoy",
          "For 20Bs you get a guided tour in either English or Spanish, this lasts approx 45 mins so good for teenagers with a short attention span! You get to see around the monastery and the highlight (literally) would be the view from the church rooftop overlooking the city. The access",
          "Besides the church, the huge space in front is a central gathering for many events in the city. In fact, the entire time we stayed here, every night there was a band playing and the plaza is so crowded. Back to the church, it is located in the Sagarnaga area. The",
          "Tours are available every day of the week besides Sunday for 20 Bs. This grants you entrance and also a tour guide. I went alone, and they didn't even make me wait. I got a personal tour. They offer English and Spanish (maybe others but those were the only ones they offered me).",
          "Great spot to be at. The markets start from here, the mall is across the street and the street vendors...we'll some of the best in La Paz.",
          "Located west of El Prado. Founded in 1548. The facade is decorated with stone carvings of chirimoyas, pinecones and tropical birds. It is just a lovely church and when you go inside you can feel at peace and get the feel of how many Bolivians are devoted Catholics.",
          "The church was certainly built on a grand scale and while the Italian marble flooring is opulent the rest is not as ornate as other churches such as in Cusco etc. It's free to get in so worth a quick look if you're passing.",
          "Our guide spoke good English and took great interest in his job. The church is quite amazing. No photos allowed inside but that only cemented the experience for me.",
          "There was a lot of history behind this church, and it is beautifully maintained. Our tour guide was young, but knowledgeable, and we enjoyed our time here. We went on a weekday during the day and ended up being there the same time as some local schools were doing tours, but our",
          "This is a must! We visited the church with an English guide, a very knowledgeable social science student who guaranteed that we got all historical information. The site with the first column of the church in 1549 was impressive, also the visit to the roof top with bells!",
          "Loved the tour, I was guided by a charming young lady that explained everything and I was very impressed. Very nice little tour.",
          "The buildings are amazing, but it was the guide who made it special. A young woman named Helen who spoke excellent English explained the allegorical meanings of the paintings to me in a way that unlocked them for me -- I should add I've been to dozens of galleries all over the",
          "We enjoyed the life and vivacity on the plaza outside of the church. The guide gave us an interesting accounting of the church's start and the early days of Catholocism in Bolivia",
          "This church was founded in 1543 and has a lot of history. There two kinds of tours. The museum tour that takes you up to the bell tower and the church tour. I took the museum tour and was able to take some breath taking pics. Watch you step because the floor and steps are",
          "We didn't have a plan on what to do after returning from Tiwanaku, so we decided to pop in and see the church. It was a beautiful place to visit! The tour guides (free of charge) were great and very knowledgeable, the architecture is beautiful and history of the place is great.",
          "This is one of the most beautiful churches I have ever visited in Bolivia. It is a real historical treasure with a breathtaking architectural baroque style! The interior of the building looks expansive and the \"retablos\" are immensely rich and ornamented; not to mention the",
          "We didn't go inside because it didn't look open. All the locals were sitting in front of the doors. It's a marvellous building to look at from outside anyway. The plaza is a great place to people watch. There is also a huge souvenir market behind and a huge food market in the",
          "Wonderful Colonial Church in La Paz with a crypt beneath the basilica, have a museum in the colonial convent",
          "The church was OK and the convent beside it, nicer. The guide who showed it was not really friendly, She just pointed out four times that 'if by accident you make one of the bells ring you should pay a big fine of 1000 BOV'.",
          "A very building housing an imposing Cathedral of a neo classical style and not the common Baroc style found by most Catholic churches. The building with beautiful Greek style columns is plane but respectfull surrounded by wonderful stained glass made in Italy. The Cathedral was",
          "the church is located in the central plaza. The inside is beautiful with large ceilings and beautiful stained glass",
          "Right in down-town stands this church, the visit includes a tour to the SF monatesry/museum and the temple. My favorite part is to go up to the roof and see the city from there.",
          "Very interesting church in the center of La Paz. I found that La Paz does not have that many exciting places to visit so this one is a must. Like most churches in southern America this one is richly decorated and the main altar is spectacular and do are the side altars.",
          "This is a great place to visit and soak up the history. It's very crowded outside and can be loaded full of tourists. Be careful with your belongings. Read up on the history of this amazing church and the area as well is full of rich history - far away and recent history as",
          "Glamorous, rich, splendid ... There are not too many places in La Paz that deserve a visit, this one definitely does. Decorated in the typical ostentatious manner this is a fantastic place to visit. The main altar is spectacular, much like the ones seen in churches in Peru.",
          "I had been in La paz three times before i finally visited this magnificent gem in the heart of the city. the tour was cheap and well coordinated with excellent hosts that even spoke English. Very impressive service for such a cheap tour. The building and all the paintings are",
          "This was an important church in the history of Bolivia and a visit is a very worthwhile experience. The cost is a paltry. 20 Bolivianos and includes a guided tour. We wandered about reading the English postings but joined a tour which took us to some places we could not access",
          "The church in the middle of the city is Iglesia de San Francisco. Although the building itself is quite old and very impressive, I found the surrounding area to be much more interesting. Up the side street of the church is where you will find all the street vendors selling",
          "Gloria was our tour guide. Great!! Tour was in Spanish, but I understand there is an English option. Very interesting tour with great works of art, then a visit to the top of the church for a birds eye view and a behind the scenes look at the running of the church. So much",
          "Right from the intricate facade and into the church itself...one cannot but go back to the time when this was built, Spanish conquistadores laying what they must have seen a magnificent relic of christianity on South American soil, very rich in design and lavish in gold.",
          "So much colour, a Bolivian flavour of the Catholic faith with strong Spanish roots. A mass started about 10 minutes after we arrived so we did curtail our visit somewhat, but we did enjoy the colourful interior & the facade even more.",
          "The church is a great example of mestizo-baroque. Building and artworks from indigenous people and Spanish colonisers. The adjoining museum is well worth the visit. You can climb to have a great view of the elaborate roofs and tiles and to watch Pace\u00f1os from above on their day",
          "This was a beautiful place to visit and the museum was very interesting as well as the outside of this structure. Very crowded though so beware of your belongings.",
          "You need to get the tour - they will take you places, like the belfry and the painting collection - you can't otherwise see.",
          "This church has an amazing stone carved facade depicting natural themes. The interior has extravagantly carved altar pieces with abundant gold leaf. The cloisters house the museum which is well worth a visit as you get to see the choir, the dome roof and view the the interior",
          "This is one of the old church here. The architecture is good.Quite crowed all the time.Worth the visit.",
          "Many people hang out outside this church, people sitting on the footsteps of the church, either talking or eating or just resting. Quite an interesting site for me. I guess even the outside of the church bring some kind of comfort and rest. The inside of the church is amazing. I",
          "Nice place to know the culture of la Paz and shout America but you have to watch out. It is no a safe place for tourist, take care you cameras, wallet and back pack",
          "Very impressive Spanish style church that is a historic location in the city of La Paz. Sorry no pictures inside, but comeback at night for the free public shows and entertainment outside the church.",
          "The museum basically consists of two rooms, one that explains the story of settlement and the other shows the old brewing equipment. The savior for our 20bs each was access to the roof of the church. Looking down into the church from the upper level was good and then using some",
          "Really interesting Franciscan monastery and church-they have tours in English and Spanish. A lot of history, art and architecture to enjoy.",
          "very nice and relaxing place to unwind and relax. Not a lot to do, would not make a special trip here again.",
          "A historic church at the upper end of El Prado (main street in La Paz), in Plaza San Francisco, first built in 16th century, rebuilt in 18th century. You can go in church for free, and visit the museum for 20 Bolivianos (about \u00a32), where they take you on a tour of the cloisters",
          "We took the tour for 20 bol each, and it includes a guide. The guide was the worst we ever had in our lives. He could not answer any of our questions... Basically you have to follow him, and listen to his explanations, which he learned, but don't be curious you will never get",
          "You can visit the church itself without paying for a tour, and it is quite beautiful on its own. The architecture is very unique with many indigenous touches. However I would recommend that you pay for a tour at the museum next door. It cost us only 20 bolivianos and we were",
          "With nothing to do in the city at the time I paid the entrance fee and didn't expect much. The church is so so beautiful and there's so many rooms to explore. Gorgeous courtyard outside with a garden and fountain. Once you get onto the top roof you have an amazing view of the",
          "Beautiful church, and the included your was great too, really added to the experience, giving you a good history, not just of the church, but of the city too. Must see while in La Paz.",
          "I'd say it's just another church. I was there when the pope visited and the area was quite animated. I prefered the plaza in front of the church to the church itself. This area of La Paz is quite touristical, but It's nice.",
          "It's quite a beautiful church! I was lucky enough to be there during \"Semana Santa\". So there was plenty of activities outside the church. This also meant learning about the history regarding the church without taking the tour. I didn't take the tour this time I visited but I",
          "San Francisco church is located at the end of Sagnagara, a main tourist shopping street. And is beautiful inside. Much more ornate than the main cathedral a few blocks away. Take time to come in to see the sanctuaries and main alter.",
          "I typically get saddened by visiting churches of the conquering society, but in this case, this cathedral was fascinating to me. Pay attention to the foundation of the church, and the small ways that the Bolivian artisans worked in their own aesthetic and expression into the",
          "Nice, but I didn't think it was that special or that it stood out from other churches. Still, the area around it is extremely lively - there are tour agencies, a market, accommodation, etc. that make it a good place to visit.",
          "It is a very good place/ historic site to visit. It is right at the historic central part of La Paz. We love visiting historic sites and this one was very good and we really enjoyed visiting the whole of La Paz city",
          "We have visited a lot if chr he's and whilst it does get a little repetitive, this one is pretty good. We got the free tour with our entry (but slipped a small tip to our guide) and we felt this was a nice way to learn about some if the history, and also be taken up the bell",
          "Bas\u00edlica de San Francisco and its adjoining museum are a gift to the traveler. One can climb to the belfry and enjoy a brilliant view of downtown La Paz. Mass service is also a very rewarding experience for catholic people.",
          "Overall the church is nice and is located in a nice plaza, but it isn't spectacular. HOWEVER, the tour made it much more interesting. I thought it was a bit on the pricier side (bolivia standards) for a tour but it is guided (english or spanish) and lasts about 45 minutes. It is",
          "Building is impressive, typical is churches in South America. Is visited by tourists and locals . At the entrance there is always something going on.",
          "Great stop for a bit of history and chance to walk in the catacombs and see bones of monks in the past.",
          "It is a nice old church in a cute area. The square is always full of people and the neighborhood around it is nice to explore.",
          "Beautiful old church in a great part of the city. In all honestly we weren't the right people to appreciate a historic church, but it is impressive and worth a stop.",
          "That's a beautiful church right in the middle of La Paz! Close to the most famous streets. It is beautiful also inside. During the day, the square in the front is always crowded.",
          "amazing colonial old church in the center of la paz.our hotel was located very close to this church so we have had the chance to see it at different times of the day. quaint spot",
          "This is an very impressing place to see, with art and artifacts all over its almost required to visit this place more than once. I had a great time for hours walking around this huge place which is open to public from the church floor to the spire with the bells. Especially one",
          "Its free...its beautifull ....its....huge...images....it takes you back in time as soon as you get in....not sure if you can take pictures I guess you can....only at the museums you are not allowed to take pictures...",
          "when I get there, a lot of policeman are getting ready for the carnival on the ground in front of the iglesia. it was crazy.",
          "Beautiful facade and plaza outside The inside nothing spectacular and no fotos inside. Lots of souvenir shops in the side street but nothing notable.",

          "The San Francisco church as it stands today is built on the site of an earlier one which was destroyed during a massive snowstorm that collapsed the building. The tour includes access to the bell tower. English speaking guides are available, though they are provided gratis",
          "San Francisco is a central spot with lots of activities. Nice place to people watch. We had no problems but do get local advice on safety if you'll be there late in the evenings or at night.",
          "I came to the church in the evening towards the end of a service. I only had about 20 minutes inside so we quickly made a round and ended up seeing most of the statues displayed. The day must have been quite sacred beause there was this little candle filled room that people",
          "The church itself is big and is nice to see all the people around it, when I went for the first time there was a graduation going on and it was cool to see the locals there celebrating however the church itself is nothing extra special in terms of architecture or internal",
          "The Church is quite impressive all though a lot smaller than I was expecting. Next door there is a museum with a wide collection of art that was pretty good. I actually preferred the Basilica further up the road.",
          "Really like how the church makes a real effort to educate people on the history of la paz and the region as you tour through the church. They have signs in English, spanish, and French so you know exactly what you're looking at. Definitely go to the bell tower to look out over",
          "Nice place to vista for an afternoon if you get stuck out in the rain. Some nice architecture, gives a brief history of La Paz and has some very nice art work.",
          "It is an icon of La PAz, Life generates around it. The barroque architecture is very pretty and its shear size imposes, The altar is gorgeous. It is a must see.",
          "We first went into the church and that was spectacular. I am non religious but this church is very impressive. It is very ornate with lots of gold leaf adorning the many saint platforms. The alter was beautiful and inspiring. Right next door is the museum. This is a MUST see. It",
          "This church is on a busy street around the corner from the Witch's market. The streets are full of people and there are definitely people harassing foreigners for money. One followed my husband and I so closely and didn't take no for an answer that we eventually paid him to",
          "Maybe the most beautiful structure in La Paz Nice location but be extremely careful as the place is notorious for thieves and pickpockets. Don't go alone but do go. Food in street good and reasonable",
          "A stunning building in the centre of La Paz where you can sit for hours on the steps and watch the locals go about their business. It really was an amazing spot to people watch.",
          "Very impresive church. It\u00b4s a nice place to hang (outside of course), lots of street artists do their shows at the square in front of the church...",
          "We paid our 20 bobs each not knowing what to expect. The church is immense and OTT which had been our experience in most of Bolivia and Peru. You are able to climb up onto the roof via very narrow staircases. This affords views across the rooftops and to the courtyards below.",
          "It is a good place to tour through and you can even go the the roof for a good view of the city. Good history of the city from the colonial view point.",
          "Watched from far = Amazing... Getting inside = Interesting!!. Personally i recomend to visit the church for a little tour, depending of the guide you will just leave the place amazed or with a lot of ( ??? ). I recomend to visit it at morning when you can go up to the bell tower",
          "San Francisco was part of the original hub of La Paz. The church itself isn't as spectacular as other cathedrals, but is a worthwhile visit for the historical significance. For 20Bs you can go through the museum with a guide. Be sure to ask to go to the roof if it isn't",
          "Here is my review of the museum It costs 20 bolivianos and this comes with a Spanish guide, no English. The museum includes the old church. What I like Very spacious English text on the museum pieces Access to church roof and tower Upper view of the church Centrally located",
          "must visit the museum inside and also the main hall, in the courtyard there are usually activities and free walks during the day",
          "... this cathedral does not compare to the European ones. But there is enough to see with nice decorations, so there will be no regrets visiting the church if it's the first one you see. If it's not and you've had your fill of the dolls representing saints/JMJ, no worries",
          "I went to the Sunday mass.. It was in Spanish which I enjoyed. But they also have English mass. The structure of the church is breath taking there's also history of the church in front. Enjoy",
          "San Francisco Cathedral is an Icon in the La Paz, Original Colonial, the lights make it ever more beautiful at night. I LOVE the typical folkloric stores in Calle Sagarnaga next to the Cathedral. A Must visit place and shop.",
          "San francisco's church is located in the touristic area of La Paz's downtown right beside Sagarnaga street. It has a colonial/franciscan style and a big square in front of it, where there are frequent public artistic presentations.",
          "As with many cathedrals around the world, it's going to look beautiful inside and have interesting architecture outside. The Museum is one of those \"must-do\" things in La Paz, so do it.",
          "Beautifull church with great architecture and beautiful wood carvings. have a seat and watch the locals pray and worship.",
          "Very beautiful it's worth visiting it when u are in La Paz! Make sure u go to the restaurant in front it has an amazing view of it",
          "The church was near my hotel so I visited it for an hour one morning. There was hardly anyone there so I was able to take my time. You can't take pictures inside, otherwise I'd have recorded the wine barrels for making wine and pisco! Staff was friendly enough, I had a janitor",
          "I'll begin by saying that I'm not a huge fan of museums to begin with, but I wasn't super impressed with the tour or the tour guide that comes with the 20 boliviano entry fee. You're mainly looking at paintings, which all have descriptions, so I'd personally rather just go at my",
          "This is pretty much the heart of La PAz, and the square to the front is probably the best spot to enjoy the rich hubbub of local life. there are often musical, cultural events held there, and its a great location to head out from to all areas of the surrounding city too. Same",
          "A lovely plain stone church with extraordinary carvings on the east portal and the high altar. I was sorry that the museum was not open on any of the 4 days that we stayed nearby.",
          "They have a guided tour where you can go up the bell tower and have a nice look from the city. Aside from that, the architecture is so beautiful, that you get to admire all other places behind the facade. Entrance for foreigners is a bit higher, but as a local I truly enjoyed it.",
          "it was an interesting church but it is not a must to do in la Paz, pretty similar to the many churches in Peru with mixed artworks",
          "It opens only at 4pm, it\u2019s rather dark inside, and signs on the wall inside indicate that photography is forbidden. The church itself is a fairly impressive structure when viewed from the street, but inside it\u2019s rather plain, as far as catholic cathedrals are concerned. The",
          "The church itself is a lot like a lot of other Andean Cathedrals but it was originally the church of the Indio with the church for the Spanish across the river (now underneath the street called the Prado). There are guided tours that give you some access to parts of the church",
          "We were able to gain entrance to the church although as previously mentioned no photo's. Worth a walk around to see the luxuries inside the church, however if you are lucky enough to have a guide they will be able to explain the history of the church as well as the structure",
          "This place is easy to locate and perhaps the most lively place in the evenings. The church is pretty decent for a visit, no photographs are allowed. The lane next to the church has lot of shops where you can buy souvenirs.",
          "A catholic church with a lot of pomp in gold inside. Outsite many beggar, \"artists\" and tourists until late in the night.",
          "Some may say that La Paz is short on sights, but this is definitely one not to miss. You can only explore with a guide and photography is not allowed (as is the case with many museums in La Paz). The guide was knowledgeable and they have done a good job preserving relics,",
          "Its easy to find and visit in La Paz. My favourite building in La Paz, the rest of the city is a bit bland/run down.",
          "The San Francisco museum is one of my favorites in the city. It offers great insight into the history of La Paz and the country. It's definitely worth a visit.",
          "This 350 year old church is amazing in terms of both history and architecture! It also has a nice museum. Not so much the glass cases full of old things museum, but more of a walking tour which includes the bell tower with a great view of that area of La Paz. Basically,",
          "Old historic church with art museum, tour of bell tower and choir balcony, and plenty of daily street life out front. Several daily masses are held.",
          "Its cheap and the guides give very interesting information, with great paints and rooms. The guides seem really nice and friendly.",
          "Iglesia de San Francisco is an interesting cathedral, but doesn't really stand out from any others. Go to the museum next to it though and you will get a personalised tour around the former convent and can walk up on to the roof for some great views.",
          "The Church is nice, big and is a focal point in La Paz. The 20 bs museum tour is the way to go. Right next door to the main doors for the church. (closed on Sundays). The tour takes you around the inside grounds of the church. The 20 bs includes a guide that helps a lot.",
          "While the church itself is beautiful and worth spending a few moments in, the real gem here is the museum in what used to be the monastery. Completely fascinating glimpse of the history of both the church/monastery, as well as that of the surrounding city.",
          "I would not travel to La Paz to see this church, but if you made it already to La Paz, it's worthwhile visiting this site and its surroundings. Lots of history within (not properly \"packaged\" for tourists, which, in my opinion, is great). Very old construction (for LatAm",
          "Just like all the other churches, not too much different really. Museum next door which we didn't visit but we were in church for a mass and looked around and it's forgettable",
          "This was a pretty church and convent. I think we unfortunately had a new guide who did not seem very well versed in the history which made the visit significantly less interesting. The distillery area was pretty neat. I listened in on another tour and wished we were part of that",
          "Built exactly over the Choqueyapu river where the \u201cSpanish\u201d city ended and the \u201cIndian\u201d city started, San Francisco church is the most important colonial religious building of La Paz. There are plenty of beautiful churches in Potos\u00ed and Sucre, but La Paz has only San Francisco",
          "We went to this museum expecting to see more pictures of Jesus and a church. The price of admission includes a private tour guide (meaning, we walked in and were immediately assigned an English-speaking tour guide), and this tour was excellent! We learned much about Bolivian",
          "Peaceful, interesting history, crypt closed the afternoon we were there but our tickets were good for a return visit.",
          "This is one of the communal hubs in La Paz. You can go to church, take in a puppet show, catch a bus, or try some street food. Just up the street is textile shopping, the witches market, and lots of restaurants.",
          "San Francisco has small cedar altars decorated with gold leaf designs. Candles are not used in churches here because of fire.",
          "Initially I wasn't planning on visiting the Cathedral, but then stumbled upon it as I was looking for the Witches Market. Once inside they provided a guide who spoke English. Usually, I prefer to self-tour, but I was pleasantly surprised by the information I learned about La Paz",
          "This church is centrally located and always teeming with people, especially on the weekends. Interesting colonial architecture.",
          "This place was well worth a visit but for me it was quite religious (I know it is a church but went into a lot of religious detail) It was wonderful that the guide was included in the entry fee and she was very helpful. Would recommend as it is beautiful and is a good way to",
          "One of the most beautiful and impressive colonial church in all South America. But be advised that it opens only after 3:30 pm!!!",
          "The most important historical building of La Paz is the San Francisco church, started in the mid-eighteenth century to replace an old church of the sixteenth century, as the first attempts to raise a temple dating back to 1549. The architect unknown certainly deserves to occupy",
          "I loved to see the church inside, never did it in my life and never imagined it would be so tranquil and peaceful to be inside the building itself. The terrace is awesome for a different perspective of crazy La Paz",

          "A beautiful church, and the best part is that a tour (in Spanish, maybe also in English) is included in the entry price. Our guide was very knowledgeable and seemed to enjoy showing us around and her explanations made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable than just aimlessly",
          "Did a tour. Our guide was very friendly and spoke great English. It was great to hear the history of the Monastery and Bolivia. Out on the roof top you can see the great bells and views of the city. A must see.",
          "Beautiful, among a circuit of really beautiful ornate churches in the area all in walking distance of each other.",
          "There wasn't really much inside. It has a pretty outside, so worth walking to, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go see it.",
          "There is a tour inside that you can do for less than 2 pounds. It's great cause it takes you to the secret areas of the Church. You will be happily surprise.",
          "Heart of the city great old Cathedral well kept. Tour was well worth it and views very pleasant. Would recommend it.",
          "This cathedral gives you a taste of what European cathedrals must have been like before war stripped them of their finery. Colorful and glittering, and filled with worshipers of every class.",
          "Had a great guide to take us around the buildings which were lovely. Great views from the bell tower!",
          "I just enjoyed the concert of a Bolivian youth orchestra in this very special colonial church, with pieces composed by both Bolivian and western composers. Therefore, in this complex you can see some exquisite religious artwork, and visit the museum to get a better understanding",
          "Its a beautiful temple and the museum its amazing, you can stand on roofs and see al the antiques. Its great!",
          "Huge and very old church at the bottom of Sagarnaga street. It is good to see it once or to escape the madness from outside.",
          "This is tipped as one of the most beautiful churches in Bolivia and it certainly lived up to that reputation. I was fortunate to enter the church at the beginning of mass and was able to join in the service and receive a blessing at the alter.",
          "Wonderful, old cathedral in the heart of La Paz, just down the hill from one of the great shopping streets for artisan works. I wish they had been a little more gracious about allowing photographs. Maybe charge a small fee?",
          "If you like churches, this is not to be missed. Great example of the inclusion of indigenous motifs within the Christian themes. The museum associated with the church is also very interesting.",
          "A central meeting/chill out point on the outside and a lovely serene, calming place on the inside. Nice to catch mass here too.",
          "i love the church it is full of spirituality for i am a follower of st. francis of asissi, the only made me sad was when i attended the holy mass you can count on your finger the youth attending holy mass on saturday night and the church is not even full, only old people was",
          "One of the things to see in La Paz. Don't expect an English speaking tour guide. There are readers in both Spanish and English. It's a couple blocks away from Witches Market and makes a great addition to a walking afternoon.",
          "okay. Not spectacular. Many local folks there, and some tourists as well. Well located in the center, and close to calle sagarnaga, the touristic street for artesania....Gd place to stop by and pray for my trip....And thank God for the peace and rest afforded me by the church",
          "It is crowd outside, be careful. Inside and roof walk .. and a great view.",

          "The cathedral is definitely worth a visit. For 20 Bs you get an English speaking guide, who guide you through the cathedral and explaine everything. I took nice pictures of the cloister and the garden. View from the bell tour is nice as well. I would recommend to visit the",
          "We paid our entry fee and were instantly met by a guide to show us around. She explained all the areas that we were allowed in to with great detail and I dont think we would have enjoyed the church half as much otherwise. She also had keys to the crypt/roof etc which I don't",
          "The church is large, lovely and mostly austere by SA standards (apart from behind the alter). The museo at 20 BS pp is relatively expensive compared to what else you can get for 20 BS - but the view from the bell tower is worth it. We were very lucky that the sun came out as we",
          "But nothing amazing. It has a nice architecture, but there aren't any guides in the place explaining its history",

          "Great architecture. Going to the rooftop was great.",
          "The church looks lovely from the outside, with its bare stonework, but if you get a chance - go inside. It is only open for mass, so go at around 6pm and you will be able to see the stunning golden altars. It really is one of the most beautiful colonial churches I have seen",
          "I liked this church because of the distinctively South American way baroque decor was interpreted, with statues of holy figures clothed in elaborate garb, and that a service was still drawing worshippers.",
          "I was in awe at the church and its beautiful altars, paintings etc. Unfortunately there is no photography allowed, same goes for the Museum which is overpriced at 20B.",

          "It was too caotic! They are working on Calle Sagarnaga, therefore trying to walk around is not easy.",
          "More or less in the center of La Paz you will find this old wonderful and beautiful church. The ceiling is wonderful decorated and the peace inside is fantastic. That day we almost had the church for our self.",
          "It is worth a visit outside and inside. Monumental, baroque style church... It has lovely carved wooden gates and there is plenty of images and ornaments inside.",
          "Lots to see with the museum, painting gallary, roof view, crypt, AND church. Guided tour wasn't great (rushed us through the interesting, gave too many details in the boring) but DEFINITELY worth the time. Took about an hour and a half."

        "wiki": "Hacienda Luisita is a 6,453-hectare sugar plantation located in the province of Tarlac, Philippines. The hacienda spans 11 barangays in three towns of Tarlac province. Most of the original farmworkers reside in 10 villages \u2013 Barangays Balete, Cutcut (or Sta. Catalina), Lourdes (formerly Texas), Mapalacsiao (formerly Luisita), Asturias, and Bantog in Tarlac City; Barangay Motrico in La Paz town; and Barangays Parang (formerly San Sebastian), Mabilog (formerly Pasajes) and Pando in Concepcion town. The original estate includes the Central Azucarera de Tarlac (CAT) sugar mill and a golf course. The eleventh village is Barangay Central in Tarlac City which houses the CAT sugar mill, the St. Martin de Porres Hospital and the Our Lady of Lourdes Church. It features Luisita Golf and Country Club, a golf course and Las Haciendas de Luisita Subdivision, a 5-interconnected luxury subdivision.Originally owned by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda General de Tabacos de Filipinas, it is now owned by the Cojuangco family who acquired the hacienda in the late 1950s. The estate's incorporators, who control 70 percent of Hacienda Luisita's stock shares, are Pedro Cojuangco, Josephine C. Reyes's heirs, Teresita C. Lopa's heirs, Jos\u00e9 Cojuangco, Jr., and Mar\u00eda Paz C. Teopaco, all siblings of the late former President Coraz\u00f3n C. Aquino who, on the day she became President of the Philippines, bequeathed her shares to her children and the Daughters of Charity and other non-profit organizations. The remaining 30 percent of the stock shares was given to farm workers under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program's stock distribution option scheme.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Spanish era ===\n\nHacienda Luisita was once part of the holdings of Compa\u00f1\u00eda General de Tabacos de Filipinas, Sociedad An\u00f3nima, better known as Tabacalera. The land was owned by Spain, by virtue of the country's colonial relationship to the Philippines. The tobacco company was founded on 26 November 1881 by the Spaniard Antonio L\u00f3pez y L\u00f3pez from Comillas, Cantabria and Santiago de Cuba, and Don Guillermo Rubio born in Santander, Cantabria.In 1780, the popularity of cigars in the Philippines prompted Spanish authorities to impose a tobacco monopoly, such that the only ones able to plant, manufacture, and sell cigars were the colonial government. Tabacalera was a private enterprise Lopez y Lopez founded with the sole intention of taking over the Philippine Tobacco Monopoly from the Spanish colonial government; the monopoly was abolished a year after Lopez y Lopez acquired the estate. This included the Hacienda Antonio (named after his eldest son), Hacienda San Fernando and Hacienda Isabel (named after his eldest daughter) in Cagay\u00e1n and Isabela provinces where the La Flor de Isabela cigar was cultivated. Due to the high profits of sugar and tobacco in the Philippines, Antonio L\u00f3pez y L\u00f3pez and his son, Claudio L\u00f3pez Bru, the second to hold the title, donated some of the profits to the Jesuits to create the Pontifical University of Comillas, a university outside Madrid.\n\n\n=== American period ===\n\nDuring the American period, the hacienda supplied almost 20% of America's sugar from 1898 to the 1940s (from the Spanish\u2013American War until World War II) back when the Tabacalera still owned it. Because of this, the Luisita sugar became popular locally as well. The Spanish-owned hacienda flourished mainly because of America's obsession with sugar. In the 1920s, Tabacalera then left the tobacco business to focus on the growing sugar industry to cater to US\u2019 needs since this product was more profitable at the time. They invested heavily on the business by constructing a sugar refinery known as \"Central Azcurarera de Tarlac\" (CAT) which used America's centrifugal machinery technology in order to double the production and lessen the cost of shipping sugar to a refinery in Laguna owned by the Roxas Family.The refinery became the largest sugar central in the Philippines thus increasing Tabacalera's profits. With a new production line, the refinery required a new system for more efficiency. Workers were laid off or forced to retire since old farm workers were not familiar with the new technology. This then resulted to continuous protests for a year. The Hacienda produced 126,129 tons of sugar in 1928 as well as allegedly receiving additional tons of sugar with current prices of Php 23,450. The workers then found out that the hacienda was receiving multiple fines that were deducted from the workers\u2019 wages, which sparked outrage.\n\n\n=== Japanese occupation of the Philippines ===\nDuring the Japanese period, the Hacienda still continued all operations in sugar production. A Japanese policy was put in place to ensure that supplies in commodities such as rice and sugar were not interrupted and were made available to Filipinos in order to avoid insurgencies or rebellions. The continuation of the production both served the Japanese and the Spanish's interests at that time.In 1942, Luis Taruc and 200 members formed HUKBALAHAP, a peasant based guerrilla army to fight the Japanese forces. Many of these members were farmers of Hacienda Luisita because of their discontent with Tabacalera, advocating for the distribution of land. On 25 January 1945, General Douglas Macarthur set up his headquarters at Hacienda Luisista to fight Japanese forces in the Philippines.\nIn 1947, a farmer's wife was reported to be raped by one of the remaining Spanish directors of the hacienda. In support of her, other wives lay themselves on the railroad tracks to stop the trains carrying sugar from being delivered. The Spanish director immediately left for Spain which pushed the Huks to execute Spanish \"encargados\" or managers in front of the guest house when they refused to admit to the crime.\n\n\n=== Jos\u00e9 Cojuangco period (1957-1976) ===\n\nIn 1957, the owners of the Tabacalera decided to sell Hacienda Luisita as well as the sugar mill, Central Azcurarera de Tarlac (CAT), because of the HUKBALAHAP rebels who were causing them problems. The CAT was supposed to be sold to the Lopez family of Iloilo but then the purchase was vetoed by President Ramon Magsaysay due to the clan owning multiple businesses such as Meralco, ABS-CBN, the Manila Chronicle, Negros Navigation, as well as a number of substantial agricultural holdings, which the president deemed to problematic because the Lopez's were becoming too powerful. \nPresident Magsaysay then offered the Central Azcurarera de Tarlac to Jose Cojuangco Sr. through Ninoy Aquino Jr (Jose's son-in-law) in early 1957. Ninoy Aquino was Magsaysay's political prodigy and personal assistant at that time, which helped the Cojuangcos in purchasing the CAT. As agreed upon, the hacienda would be paid for in pesos, while the CAT would be paid for in US dollars. The Philippine government aided the Cojuangcos in obtaining the loans needed to pay the price.In 1957, the clan took control of the CAT and the hacienda through Manufacturer's Trust Co New York. endorsed by the Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) as well as Government System Insurance Service (GSIS). The BSP then approved the loan on August 1957 under two conditions, one of which states that the CAT be bought together with Hacienda Luisita and that the hacienda shall be distributed to farmers under the Magsaysay's social justice program. The government then authorized a P 5.9 million loan from GSIS which was approved on November 1957. The Cojuangcos were given a ten-year window to distribute the lands to farmers as stipulated. Finally on 1958, Jose Cojuangco Sr.\u2019s Tarlac Development Corporation (TADECO) became the new owner of Hacienda Luisita as well as the CAT. Ninoy Aquino then became Luisita\u2019s first administrator.\n\n\n=== Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos (1965-1986) ===\nThe year 1967 marked the end of the 10-year window given to the Cojuangcos that the Philippine government gave in order to distribute the land. However, the Cojuangcos failed to distribute any land. In response, farmers\u2019 organizations began to form in order to push for the distribution.This was combined with political unrest in the nation. The United Luisita Workers Union (ULWU) was created because of this. This year was also when Benigno Aquino Jr. was elected senator.Nationwide Martial Law was declared on 21 September 1972, and Benigno Aquino Jr., the son-in-law of Jose \"Pepe\" Cojuangco, was among the first to be imprisoned for treason, murder, subversion and weapons possession. During this time, the Marcos administration took an interest in enforcing land reform.Jose Cojuangco died on 21 August 1976, five years from the day of the Plaza Miranda bombing. On 7 May 1980, the government filed a case against Tarlac Development Corporation, or TADECO (a Cojuangco company) before the Manila Regional Trial Court (RTC). The case (Republic of the Philippines vs. TADECO, Civil Case No. 131654, Manila Regional Trial Court, Branch XLIII) sought the surrender of the hacienda to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform in order to properly distribute the land to the qualified farm workers. The Cojuangcos responded to the case saying that there were no such tenants or farm workers qualified to receive such land. This was during the same time that Ninoy Aquino and his family were to leave for exile in the United States. At the time, the anti-Marcos block portrayed this lawsuit as an attack on the Aquino family by the Marcoses, while the farmers viewed it as the government taking action to help them.Ninoy Aquino was shot on 21 August 1983, as he was descending the plane. On 2 December 1985, the Manila RTC ordered TADECO to surrender Hacienda Luisita to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR, now the Department of Agrarian Reform, or DAR) due to noncompliance of the land reform act. TADECO alleged that the hacienda housed no tenants, and that the hacienda's sugar lands are not covered by existing agrarian reform legislations. The Cojuangcos brought the case to the Court of Appeals due to their belief that the case was an act of harassment by the Marcos administration because Corazon Aquino took her late husband's place to run against Marcos in the 1986 snap elections. Of note is that land reform was one of the issues her campaign focused on. The snap elections were fraught with anti-Marcos allegations, and led to the People Power Revolution.\n\n\n=== Presidency of Coraz\u00f3n \u201cCory\u201d C. Aquino (1986-1992) ===\nDespite the installation of Corazon Aquino as president, the farmland was not being distributed. Thousands of farmers marched to Malaca\u00f1ang Palace on 22 January 1987. 13 protesting farmers were shot in what is now known as the \"Mendiola Massacre.\" On 22 July 1987, Aquino issues Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order No. 229, which outlines her agrarian reform program. In 18 May 1988, the case the Marcos administration filed against TADECO was dismissed by the Court of Appeals, and the Philippine government, under the Aquino administration, moved to dismiss its own case. In 10 June 1988, the Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law) is signed into law by President Aquino. The law includes a Stock Distribution Option (SDO) which would allow landowners to distribute the stock shares of the land to the farmers, instead of actual land.In compliance with the CARP, 4915.75 hectares of Hacienda Luisita were folded into Hacienda Luisita Inc. (HLI) on 23 August 1988, in order to comply with a stock distribution agreement between the landowners and farm workers. The hacienda's farmers voted 92.9% in favor of the SDO route with regards to the land reform act. This agreement was implemented on 11 May 1989. The farm workers' therefore now owned 33% of the plantation, while the Cojuangcos retained ownership of the remaining 67% of stocks. In accordance with the SDO agreement, there would be a 30-year schedule for distributing and transferring the stocks to the farmers.\n\n\n=== Present period (1992-onwards) ===\nIn 1 September 1995, 3,290 hectares of the hacienda was reclassified from agricultural to commercial, industrial, and residential land. This was passed by the Provincial Board of Tarlac, the governor of which was Margarita \"Tingting\" Cojuangco, wife of Jose \u201cPeping\" Cojuangco, Jr., brother of Cory Aquino. The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) approved the conversion of 500 hectares in 1996.In 2003, hacienda workers filed a petition to have the SDO agreement revoked, and in 2005, the DAR cancelled the stock distribution agreement. It was cited that the SDO had failed to improve the lives of the more than 5,000 farmer beneficiaries. HLI appealed this decision, but in May 2006, the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council rejected with finality the motion of HLI to reconsider the revocation of the stock distribution agreement. However, the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order, stopping the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council from parceling out the land to the workers.\n\n\n== Criticisms of ownership ==\nThe Cojuangcos have often garnered criticism for their ownership of the estate with some critics comparing the situation to problems seen in oligarchy based systems. The estate's incorporators, who control 70 percent of the stock shares of the Hacienda, are Pedro Cojuangco, the children of Josephine C. Reyes, the heirs of Teresita C. Lopa, Jos\u00e9 Cojuangco, Jr., and Mar\u00eda Paz C. Teopaco\u2014all of whom were siblings of the late former President Coraz\u00f3n C. Aquino who, on the day she became President of the Philippines, bequeathed her shares to her children and non-profit organizations such as the Daughters of Charity for fear that it would be used as political propaganda. The remaining 30 percent of the stock shares was given to farm workers under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program's Stock Distribution Option scheme.\n\n\n== Current Issues and Problems ==\n\n\n=== Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) ===\nThe signing into law of Republic Act No. 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) on 10 June 1988 signaled the beginning of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) under former President Corazon Aquino. One of the clauses of the CARP provided for a Stock Distribution Option (SDO), which would allow for compliance with the agrarian reform law by distributing stocks of the hacienda to the farm workers rather than actual land.On 9 May 1989, a referendum was held among the farm workers of Hacienda Luisita to determine whether stocks or land would be the means by which the hacienda would be distributed. The results of the May 1989 referendum, as well as a second referendum held in October of the same year, found that a great majority of the Hacienda farm workers voted in favor of distribution of stock rather than land. The terms of the SDO agreement of the Hacienda are quoted as follows:\n\n\u201cAt the end of each fiscal year, for a period of 30 years, the SECOND PARTY (HLI) shall arrange with the FIRST PARTY (TADECO) the acquisition and distribution to the THIRD PARTY (farm workers) on the basis of number of days worked and at no cost to them of one-thirtieth (1/30) of 118,391,976.85 shares of the capital stock of the SECOND PARTY (HLI) that are presently owned and held by the FIRST PARTY (TADECO), until such time as the entire block of 118,391,976.85 shares shall have been completely acquired and distributed to the THIRD PARTY (farm workers).\"\n\nThe SDO agreement however was met with considerable criticism, most notably in 2003 when hacienda workers (farmers, HLI supervisory group workers, union officers) began filing petitions to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to have the SDO agreement revoked due to their dividends and other promised benefits not being given. Daily wage was at P194.50, and there was only one working day per week, due to the mechanizing of some tasks in the hacienda. A petition with more than 5,300 signatures was filed to revoke the SDO agreement and stop land conversion in the hacienda.\nIn 2004, the workers' union tried to negotiate with the management to increase daily wages to P225 and increase work days to 2\u20133 days weekly. Management refused. In 1 October of that year, 327 workers (farm workers and union officers) were retrenched.\n\n\n=== Land reform disputes ===\n\n\n==== November 2004 Massacre ====\nOn 6 November 2004, United Luisita Workers Union (ULWU) and the Central Azucarera de Tarlac Labor Union (CATLU) launched a strike near Gate 1 of the Central Azucarera de Tarlac sugar mill. The protesters were pushing for an increase in their P9.50 weekly wage, increased worker benefits and, more broadly, a greater commitment for national land reform. Over a thousand farmers, and another several thousand union members attended the demonstration.\nOn 16 November 2004, ten days after the start of the said strike, police and soldiers were dispatched by then Labour Secretary Patricia Santo Tom\u00e1s, to storm and disperse the blockade. The enforcers utilized tear gas, water cannons, guns, and military vehicles to disseminate the crowd. Seven of the people participating in the rally were killed, an estimated number of 121 people, adults and children, were injured, and 133 people were arrested and detained.The incident has sparked a national outcry, however, then Deputy Speaker Benigno \u2018Noynoy\u2019 Aquino III, Representative of Tarlac, claims that the dispersal done by the enforcers was justified. A case was filed against the police and military with regards to the injuries and deaths, however it was dismissed by the office of the Ombudsman in 2010. Proceeding that, a motion to reopen the case was filed by the families of the victims, however, it was declined by the Office of the Ombudsman on 2 October 2014.\nThe November 2004 massacre or more popularly known as the Hacienda Luisita massacre is one of the most prominent instances of protest related deaths of Filipinos in recent years. In the months following the Hacienda Luisita massacre, eight more people who either supported or provided evidence to the farmers\u2019 cause were found murdered, beginning with the assassination of peasant leader Marcelino Beltran just before he was to testify about the massacre.\n\n\n==== Revocation of the Stock Distribution Option Agreement ====\nIn the aftermath of the November 2004 massacre, the DAR established Task Force Luisita to conduct further investigations and conduct focus group discussions among the farmers. On 22 September 2005, based on the findings of its investigations, Task Force Luisita recommended the revocation of the SDO agreement forged between Hacienda Luisita Inc. (HLI) and the farm workers. Three months later, on December of the same year, the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) issued a resolution ordering the revocation of the SDO agreement and the distribution of the hacienda's land among the farm workers. Land distribution and the cancellation of the SDO agreement was halted however in June 2006 when the Supreme Court granted the petition of HLI and issued a temporary restraining order on the PARC resolution.On 18 August 2010, oral arguments on the Hacienda Luisita case were heard by the Supreme Court for the first time since the dispute was brought to its doors in 2006. A landmark decision was ultimately reached on 5 July 2011, wherein the Supreme Court lifted the temporary restraining order on the 2005 PARC resolution and upheld both the distribution of land to the hacienda's farm workers and the revocation of the SDO agreement forged in 1989. In acknowledgement of the fact that 93% of the hacienda's farm workers voted in favor of SDO in the 1989 referendum, included in the July 2011 decision was the further mandating of the DAR to hold another referendum to determine which among the hacienda's farm workers would wish to receive land or to remain as stockholders of HLI. This decision to hold another referendum was met with considerable criticism however as critics asserted that agrarian reform laws stipulate that land distribution should be the only viable option and alternatives such as the SDO violate this.On 22 November 2011, the Supreme Court modified its July 2011 decision and revoked the option for the hacienda farm workers to remain as stockholders of HLI, stating:\n\n\u201cUpon a review of the facts and circumstances, We realize that the FWBs [Farmer-Worker Beneficiaries] will never have control over these agricultural lands for as long as they remain as stockholders of HLI\u2026\nIn line with Our finding that control over agricultural lands must always be in the hands of the farmers, We reconsider our ruling that the qualified FWBs should be given an option to remain as stockholders of HLI, inasmuch as these qualified FWBs will never gain control given the present proportion of shareholdings in HLI.\u201d\n\n\n==== Disputes over Landowner Compensation ====\nIn compliance with agrarian reform laws, the Supreme Court decisions further stated that HLI was entitled to payment by the government as just compensation for distributing the hacienda's lands to the farm workers. The corporation was to receive compensation for the distributed land based on its valuation on the date of its taking from HLI.\nIn line with this, HLI presented 2 January 2006 as the appropriate date of taking based on when a Notice of Coverage was issued by the DAR placing the hacienda's land under compulsory acquisition. However the Supreme Court maintained its initial stance that the date of taking be marked at 21 November 1989, based on when the original stock distribution plan was approved, stating this was when ownership of the lands was initially relinquished to make way for its distribution to the farm workers via stock. Under the 2006 valuation of the distributed land, the compensation payment would have amounted to about P5 billion while under the 1989 valuation of the distributed land, the compensation would total only about P200 million.\n\n\n==== April 2012 Supreme Court Ruling ====\nOn 24 April 2012, the Supreme Court released a final and executory decision regarding Hacienda Luisita:\n\n\"To recapitulate, the Court voted on the following issues in this manner:\n1.    In determining the date of taking, the Court voted 8-6 to maintain the ruling fixing November 21, 1989 as the date of taking, the value of the affected lands to be determined by the LBP and the DAR;\n2.    On the propriety of the revocation of the option of the FWBs [Farmer-Worker Beneficiaries] to remain as HLI stockholders, the Court, by unanimous vote, agreed to reiterate its ruling in its November 22, 2011 Resolution that the [stock distribution option] granted to the FWBs stays revoked;\n3.    On the propriety of returning to the FWBs the proceeds of the sale of the 500-hectare converted land and of the 80.51-hectare SCTEX land, the Court unanimously voted to maintain its ruling to order the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the said land to the FWBs less the 3% share, taxes and expenses specified in the fallo of the November 22, 2011 Resolution;\n4.    On the payment of just compensation for the homelots to HLI, the Court, by unanimous vote, resolved to amend its July 5, 2011 Decision and November 22, 2011 Resolution by ordering the government, through the DAR, to pay to HLI the just compensation for the homelots thus distributed to the FWBS.\nWHEREFORE, the Motion to Clarify and Reconsider Resolution of November 22, 2011 dated December 16, 2011 filed by petitioner Hacienda Luisita, Inc. and the Motion for Reconsideration/Clarification dated December 9, 2011 filed by private respondents Noel Mallari, Julio Suniga, Supervisory Group of Hacienda Luisita, Inc. and Windsor Andaya are hereby DENIED with this qualification: the July 5, 2011 Decision, as modified by the November 22, 2011 Resolution, is FURTHER MODIFIED in that the government, through DAR, is ordered to pay Hacienda Luisita, Inc. the just compensation for the 240-square meter homelots distributed to the FWBs.\nThe July 5, 2011 Decision, as modified by the November 22, 2011 Resolution and further modified by this Resolution is declared FINAL and EXECUTORY. The entry of judgment of said decision shall be made upon the time of the promulgation of this Resolution.\nNo further pleadings shall be entertained in this case.\nSO ORDERED.\"\n\n\n== Current status ==\nThe Supreme Court ruling states that the 4,916 hectares of Hacienda Luisita is to be redistributed to 6,296 registered farm-worker beneficiaries, while the Hacienda Luisita Incorporated (HLI) will be receiving 40,000 pesos per hectare as compensation. This is based on the 1989 valuation of the Hacienda Luisita that the Supreme Court had voted upon. But from the 4,916 hectares to be redistributed, 500 hectares were converted into non-agricultural use in 18 August 1996 by the Department of Agrarian Reform, while 80.5 hectares was also subtracted for the development of the Subic Clark Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX). Other inconsistencies within area size have caused conflicting numbers, but according to the DAR this then leaves only 4,099.92 hectares of land to be distributed.The process of land distribution was decided to be through lottery system, wherein the names of the beneficiaries are placed into a drum, and those chosen will be given the Lot Allocation Certificate (LAC). Farmer-worker Beneficiaries then sign the  Application to Purchase and Farmers' Undertaking (APFU), for the registry of their Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA), which is the actual land title. The lottery system had started on 18 July 2013 in Barangay Cutcut, Tarlac City with 340 farmers being given the first batch of Lot Allocation Certificates.  But it was on 30 September 2013, where DAR Secretary Virgilio de los Reyes started awarding the actual Certificate of Land Ownership (CLOA) to 600 Farmer-worker beneficiaries in Barangay Pando.As of 12 July 2016, 4,099 hectares have been already distributed to farmers, but the sales shares from the Hacienda Luisita's converted land to be paid to the farmer-worker beneficiaries have been left unpaid which amounts to 1.3 billion pesos. On 24 April 2017, protesters consisting of the Unyon ng mga Manggagawa sa Agrikultura (UMA) and other militant organizations had gone to Hacienda Luisita to protest against the 348 hectare land that was turned over to Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) back in 25 November 2004 for a 431.7 million peso loan obligation. The protest led to property damage, where protesters had destroyed over 100 meters of a wall surrounding the contested lot. On 21 February 2018, Luisita Land Corporation has since filed a case against 15 farmers for the protest, for malicious mischief and trespassing of the RCBC owned land.As of 4 July 2018, the Hacienda Luisita has fully complied with distributing the sales shares to farmers. The 1.3 billion peso was broken down as such: P500 million received from Luisita Realty Inc. for a 200 hectare lot sold in 1996, P750 million for the selling of Luisita Industrial Park, and around P80 million for the 80.51 hectares used for the SCTEX road network. The ruling also states that 3% of the earlier stock transfers that were paid to the farmers will be deducted from the 1.3 billion to be received.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLand reform in the Philippines\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHacienda Luisita website",

        "wiki": "Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz   (12 November 1648 \u2013 17 April 1695) was a Mexican writer, philosopher, composer, poet of the Baroque period, and Hieronymite nun of New Spain (Mexico). Her outspoken opinions granted her lifelong names such as \"The Tenth Muse\" and \"The Phoenix of Mexico\", for she was a flame that rose from the ashes of \"religious authoritarianism\".Sor Juana lived during Mexico's colonial period, making her a contributor both to early Spanish literature as well as to the broader literature of the Spanish Golden Age. Beginning her studies at a young age, Sor Juana was fluent in Latin and also wrote in Nahuatl, and became known for her philosophy in her teens. Sor Juana educated herself in her own library, which was mostly inherited from her grandfather. After joining a nunnery in 1667, Sor Juana began writing poetry and prose dealing with such topics as love, feminism, and religion. She turned her nun's quarters into a salon, visited by the city's intellectual elite. Among them was Countess Maria Luisa de Paredes, Vicereine of Mexico. Her criticism of misogyny and the hypocrisy of men led to her condemnation by the Bishop of Puebla, and in 1694 she was forced to sell her collection of books and focus on charity towards the poor. She died the next year, having caught the plague while treating her sister.After fading from academic discourse for hundreds of years, Octavio Paz re-established Sor Juana's importance in modern times. Scholars now interpret Sor Juana as a protofeminist, and she is the subject of vibrant discourses about themes such as colonialism, education rights, women's religious authority, and writing as examples of feminist advocacy. \n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nJuana In\u00e9s de Asbaje y Ram\u00edrez de Santillana was born in San Miguel Nepantla (now called Nepantla de Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz in her honor) near Mexico City. She was the illegitimate child of a Spanish captain, Pedro Manuel de Asbaje, and a Criolla woman, Isabel Ram\u00edrez. Due to her Spanish ancestry and Mexican birth, Juana is considered a Criolla. Juana was baptized 2 December 1651 and described on the baptismal rolls as \"a daughter of the Church\", although her biological father, according to all accounts, was absent from her life. However, thanks to her maternal grandfather, who owned an Hacienda in Amecameca, Juana lived a comfortable life. She spent her early years living with her mother on his estate, Panoaya.During her childhood, Juana often hid in the Hacienda chapel to read her grandfather's books from the adjoining library, something forbidden to girls. By the age of three, Juana had learned how to read and write Latin. By the age of five, she reportedly could do accounts. At age eight, she composed a poem on the Eucharist. By adolescence, Juana had mastered Greek logic, and at age thirteen she was teaching Latin to young children. She also learned the Aztec language of Nahuatl and wrote some short poems in that language.\n\nIn 1664, at the age of 16, Juana was sent to live in Mexico City. She asked her mother's permission to disguise herself as a male student so that she could enter the university there. Without the ability to obtain formal education, Juana continued her studies privately. She was a lady-in-waiting at the colonial viceroy's court, where she came under the tutelage of the Vicereine Leonor Carreto (in Italian, Leonor del Carretto), wife of the Viceroy of New Spain Antonio Sebasti\u00e1n de Toledo. The viceroy, the Marquis de Mancera, wishing to test the learning and intelligence of the 17-year-old, invited several theologians, jurists, philosophers, and poets to a meeting, during which she had to answer many questions unprepared and explain several difficult points on various scientific and literary subjects. The manner in which she acquitted herself astonished all present and greatly increased her reputation. Her literary accomplishments garnered her fame throughout New Spain. She was much admired in the viceregal court, and she received several proposals of marriage, which she declined.\n\n\n=== As a nun ===\nIn 1667, she entered the Monastery of St. Joseph, a community of the Discalced Carmelite nuns, as a postulant, where she remained but a few months. Later, in 1669, she entered the monastery of the Hieronymite nuns, which had more relaxed rules. She chose to become a nun so that she could study as she wished since she wanted \"to have no fixed occupation which might curtail my freedom to study.\"\n\nIn the convent and perhaps earlier, Sor Juana became intimate friends with fellow savant, Don Carlos de Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora, who visited her in the convent's locutorio. She stayed cloistered in the Convent of Santa Paula of the Hieronymite in Mexico City from 1669 until her death, and there she studied, wrote, and collected a large library of books. The Viceroy and Vicereine of New Spain became her patrons; they supported her and had her writings published in Spain. She addressed some of her poems to paintings of her friend and patron Mar\u00eda Luisa Manrique de Lara y Gonzaga, daughter of Vespasiano Gonzaga, Duca di Guastala, Luzara e Rechiolo and In\u00e9s Mar\u00eda Manrique, 9th Countess de Paredes, which she also addressed as L\u00edsida.\n\nIn November 1690, the bishop of Puebla, Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez de Santa Cruz published, under the pseudonym of Sor Filotea, and without her permission, Sor Juana's critique of a 40-year-old sermon by Father Ant\u00f3nio Vieira, a Portuguese Jesuit preacher. Although Sor Juana's intentions for the work, called Carta Atenag\u00f3rica are left to interpretation, many scholars have opted to interpret the work as a challenge to the hierarchical structure of religious authority. Along with Carta Atenag\u00f3rica, the bishop also published his own letter in which he said she should focus on religious instead of secular studies. He published his criticisms to use them to his advantage against the priest, and while he agreed with her criticisms, he believed that as a woman, she should devote herself to prayer and give up her writings.\nIn response to her critics, Sor Juana wrote a letter, Respuesta a Sor Filotea de la Cruz (Reply to Sister Philotea), in which she defended women's right to formal education. She also advocated for women's right to serve as intellectual authorities, not only through the act of writing, but also through the publication of their writing. By putting women, specifically older women, in positions of authority, Sor Juana argued, women could educate other women. Resultingly, Sor Juana argued, this practice could also avoid potentially dangerous situations involving male teachers in intimate settings with young female students.In addition to being a woman in a self-prescribed position of authority, Sor Juana's radical position made her an increasingly controversial figure. She famously remarked by quoting an Aragonese poet and echoing St. Teresa of \u00c1vila: \"One can perfectly well philosophize while cooking supper.\" In response, Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas, Archbishop of Mexico joined other high-ranking officials in condemning Sor Juana's \"waywardness.\" In addition to opposition she received for challenging the patriarchal structure of the Catholic Church, Sor Juana was repeatedly criticized for believing that her writing could achieve the same philanthropic goals as community work.By 1693, she seemingly ceased to write, rather than risking official censure. However, there is no undisputed evidence of her renouncing devotion to letters, but there are documents showing her agreeing to undergo penance. Her name is affixed to such a document in 1694, but given her deep natural lyricism, the tone of the supposed handwritten penitentials is in rhetorical and autocratic Church formulae; one is signed \"Yo, la Peor de Todas\" (\"I, the worst of all women\"). She is said to have sold all her books, then an extensive library of over 4,000 volumes, and her musical and scientific instruments as well. Other sources report that her defiance toward the church led to all of her books and instruments being confiscated although the bishop himself agreed with the contents of her letters.Of over one hundred unpublished works, only a few of her writings have survived, which are known as the Complete Works. According to Octavio Paz, her writings were saved by the vicereine.She died after ministering to other nuns stricken during a plague, on 17 April 1695. Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora delivered the eulogy at her funeral.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Poetry ===\n\n\n==== First Dream ====\n\nFirst Dream, a long philosophical and descriptive silva (a poetic form combining verses of 7 and 11 syllables), \"deals with the shadow of night beneath which a person falls asleep in the midst of quietness and silence, where night and day animals participate, either dozing or sleeping, all urged to silence and rest by Harpocrates. The person's body ceases its ordinary operations, which are described in physiological and symbolical terms, ending with the activity of the imagination as an image-reflecting apparatus: the Pharos. From this moment, her soul, in a dream, sees itself free at the summit of her own intellect; in other words, at the apex of an own pyramid-like mount, which aims at God and is luminous.There, perched like an eagle, she contemplates the whole creation, but fails to comprehend such a sight in a single concept. Dazzled, the soul's intellect faces its own shipwreck, caused mainly by trying to understand the overwhelming abundance of the universe, until reason undertakes that enterprise, beginning with each individual creation, and processing them one by one, helped by the Aristotelic method of ten categories.The soul cannot get beyond questioning herself about the traits and causes of a fountain and a flower, intimating perhaps that his method constitutes a useless effort, since it must take into account all the details, accidents, and mysteries of each being. By that time, the body has consumed all its nourishment, and it starts to move and wake up, soul and body are reunited. The poem ends with the Sun overcoming Night in a straightforward battle between luminous and dark armies, and with the poet's awakening.\n\n\n==== Dramas ====\nIn addition to the two comedies outlined here (Pawns of a House [Los empe\u00f1os de una casa] and Love is but a Labyrinth [Amor es mas laberinto]), Sor Juana is attributed as the author of a possible ending to the comedy by Agustin de Salazar: The Second Celestina (La Segunda Celestina).  In the 1990s, Guillermo Schmidhuber found a release of the comedy that contained a different ending than the otherwise known ending.  He proposed that those one thousand words were written by Sor Juana.  Some literary critics, such as Octavio Paz, Georgina Sabat-Rivers, and Luis Leal) have accepted Sor Juana as the co-author, but others, such as Antonio Alatorre and Jos\u00e9 Pascual Bux\u00f3, have refuted it.\n\n\n=== Comedies ===\nScholars have debated the meaning of Juana's comedies. Julie Greer Johnson describes how Juana protested against the rigorously defined relationship between genders through her full-length comedies and humor. She argues that Juana recognized the negative view of women in comedy which was designed to uphold male superiority at the expense of women. By recognizing the power of laughter, Juana appropriated the purpose of humor, and used it as a socially acceptable medium with which to question notions of men and women.Pawns of a House\nThe work was first performed on October 4, 1683, during the celebration of the Viceroy Count of Paredes\u2019 first son's birth.  Some critics maintain that it could have been set up for the Archbishop Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas\u2019 entrance to the capital, but this theory is not considered reliable.The story revolves around two couples who are in love but, by chance of fate, cannot yet be together. This comedy of errors is considered one of the most prominent works of late baroque Spanish-American literature.  One of its most peculiar characteristics is that the driving force in the story is a woman with a strong, decided personality who expresses her desires to a nun. The protagonist of the story, Dona Leonor, fits the archetype perfectly.It is often considered the peak of Sor Juana's work and even the peak of all New-Hispanic literature. Pawns of a House is considered a rare work in colonial Spanish-American theater due to the management of intrigue, representation of the complicated system of marital relationships, and the changes in urban life.Love is but a Labyrinth\nThe work premiered on February 11, 1689, during the celebration of the inauguration of the viceroyalty Gaspar de la Cerda y Mendoza. However, in his Essay on Psychology, Ezequiel A. Chavez mentions Fernandez del Castillo as a coauthor of this comedy.The plot takes on the well-known theme in Greek mythology of Theseus: a hero from Crete Island.  He fights against the Minotaur and awakens the love of Ariadne and Fedra.  Sor Juana conceived Theseus as the archetype of the baroque hero, a model also used by her fellow countryman Juan Ruis de Alarcon. Theseus\u2019 triumph over the Minotaur does not make Theseus proud, but instead allows him to be humble.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nBesides poetry and philosophy, Sor Juana was interested in science, mathematics and music. The latter represents an important aspect because, not only because musicality was an intrinsic part of the poetry of the time but also for the fact that she devoted a significant portion of her studies to the theory of instrumental tuning that, especially in the Baroque period, had reached a point of critical importance. So involved was Sor Juana in the study of music, that she wrote a treatise called El Caracol (unfortunately lost) that sought to simplify musical notation and solve the problems that Pythagorean tuning suffered.\nIn the writings of Juana Ines, it is possible to detect the importance of sound. We can observe this in two ways. First of all, the analysis of music and the study of musical temperament appears in several of her poems. For instance, in the following poem, Sor Juana delves into the natural notes and the accidents of musical notation.Propiedad es de natura\nque entre Dios y el hombre media,\ny del cielo el be cuadrado\njunto al be bemol de la tierra.\n(Villancico 220)\nOn the other, Sarah Finley offers an interesting idea. She argues that the visual is related with patriarchal themes, while the sonorous offers an alternative to the feminine space in the work of Sor Juana. As an example of this, Finley points out that Narciso falls in love with a voice, and not with a reflection.\n\n\n=== Other notable works ===\nOne musical work attributed to Sor Juana survives from the archive of Guatemala Cathedral. This is a 4-part villancico, Madre, la de los primores.\n\n\n== Translations and Interpretations ==\n\nWhile Octavio Paz is credited with re-establishing the importance of the historic Sor Juana in modern times, other scholars have been instrumental in translating Sor Juana's work. The only translations of Carta Atenagorica are found in Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz: Selected Writings by Pamela Kirk Rappaport and The Tenth Muse: Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz by Fanchon Royer. Translations of Sor Juana's La Respuesta are credited to Electa Arenal and Amanda Powell, Edith Grossman, Margaret Seyers Peden, and Alan S. Trubeblood. These translations are respectively found in The Answer/La Respuesta, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz: Selected Works, A Woman of Genius: The Intellectual Biography of Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz and Poems, Protest, and a Dream, and A Sor Juana Anthology.Since Sor Juana's works were rediscovered after her death, scholarly interpretations and translations are both abundant and contrasting. \n\n\n=== Tarsicio Herrera Zapi\u00e9n ===\nTarsicio Herrera Zapi\u00e9n, a classical scholar, has also devoted much of his career to the study of Sor Juana's works. Some of his publications (in Spanish) include Buena fe y humanismo en Sor Juana: di\u00e1logos y ensayos: las obras latinas: los sorjuanistas recientes (1984); L\u00f3pez Velarde y sor Juana, feministas opuestos: y cuatro ensayos sobre Horacio y Virgilio en M\u00e9xico (1984); Poemas mexicanos universales: de Sor Juana a L\u00f3pez Velarde (1989) and Tres siglos y cien vidas de Sor Juana (1995).\n\n\n=== Feminist analyses and translations ===\nScholars such as Scout Frewer argue that because Juana's advocacy for religious and intellectual authority would now be associated with feminism, she was a protofeminist. In the twenty-first century, scholars generally interpret Sor Juana as a feminist before the time of feminism.\nFor instance, scholars like Rachel O\u2019Donnell argue that Sor Juana occupied a special place in between socially acceptable and socially unacceptable roles in seventeenth century Mexico. By examining Sor Juana intersectionally, they prioritize the context of New Spain, specifically the influence of religion, race, and social norms, in understanding Sor Juana as a female theologian and poet.According to O\u2019Donnell, in colonial Mexico, education was an undertaking reserved for men, especially activities like writing and reading. Consequently, scholars like Octavio Paz argue, religion became a way for women to avoid marriage. Since Sor Juana was opposed to marriage, Paz argues, entering the convent was a socially acceptable way to be a single woman in seventeenth century Mexico. Entering the convent also meant that Sor Juana could read and write about religion despite the barriers to formal education for women. O\u2019Donnell argues that Sor Juana was called a rare bird because although theology was only an acceptable pursuit for men in the Catholic Church, she actively studied religion. Sor Juana likely perceived wisdom and religion as inseparable, so she probably also believed that to follow God was to pursue wisdom. Other scholars, like Alicia Gaspar de Alba, offer instead the possibility that Sor Juana was located on the lesbian continuum and that the convent was a place where having relations with other women was socially acceptable. A fourth perspective suggests that considering the colonial context of New Spain and Sor Juana's background as a criolla, she represented colonial knowledge in a way that defied colonial religious structures.Luis Felipe Fabre criticized 'Sorjuanista' scholarship as a whole, arguing that the discourse is binary rather than complex and multilayered.\n\n\n==== Octavio Paz ====\nOctavio Paz is a Nobel Prize laureate and scholar. In the 1989 book, Sor Juana: Or, The Traps of Faith (translated from Spanish to English by Margaret Sayers Peden), Paz examines and contemplates Sor Juana's poetry and life in the context of the history of New Spain, particularly focusing on the difficulties women then faced while trying to thrive in academic and artistic fields. Primarily, Paz aims to explain why Sor Juana chose to become a nun. In Juana Ram\u00edrez, Octavio Paz and Diane Marting find that Sor Juana's decision to become a nun stemmed from her refusal to marry; joining the convent, according to Paz and Marting, was a way for Juana to obtain authority and freedom without marrying.In his analyses of Sor Juana's poetry, Octavio Paz traces some of her influences to the Spanish writers of the Golden Age and the Hermetic tradition, mainly derived from the works of a noted Jesuit scholar of her era, Athanasius Kircher. Paz interprets Sor Juana's most ambitious and extensive poem, \"First Dream\" (\"Primero Sue\u00f1o\") as a representation of the desire of knowledge through a number of hermetic symbols, albeit transformed in her own language and skilled image-making abilities. In conclusion, Paz makes the case that Sor Juana's works were the most important body of poetic work produced in the Americas until the arrival of 19th-century figures such as Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman.\n\n\n=== Alicia Gaspar de Alba ===\nAlicia Gaspar de Alba's historical novel, Sor Juana's Second Dream (1999), rejects Paz's view that Sor Juana was ambivalent to sexuality, which he portrays as an explanation of her entering the convent. Instead, Gaspar de Alba interprets Sor Juana as homoerotic. It was Sor Juana's attraction to other women, which was repressed by the patriarchal and heteronormative society outside of the convent, that led her to become a nun. She criticizes Paz for his portrayal of what she calls Sorjuanistas, whom she claims stem from a Mexican, rather than Indigenous viewpoint, and are homophobic.This work won the Latino Literary Hall of Fame Award for Best Historical Novel in 2000. In 2001, it was translated into Spanish and published as El Segundo Sue\u00f1o by Grijalbo Mondadori. The novel has also been adapted to a stage play, The Nun and the Countess by Odalys Nanin; and to a film, Juana de Asbaje, directed by Mexican filmmaker Rene Bueno, with the screenplay co-written by Bueno and Gaspar de Alba and Mexican actress Ana de la Reguera as the title role. Juana, an opera based on the novel will be performed by Opera UCLA in November 2019, the music composed by Carla Lucero and the libretto co-written by Lucero and Gaspar de Alba.\n\n\n=== Luis Felipe Fabre ===\nLuis Felipe Fabre, a Mexican writer and scholar, ridicules other scholars, whom he collectively calls Sorjuanistas, who idolize Sor Juana. In his book, Sor Juana and Other Monsters, Fabre argues that the appropriation and recontextualization imminent in scholars' interpretations of Sor Juana construct Sor Juana as either a heretic or a lesbian. Fabre suggests that such representations constitute Sor Juana as a monstrosity or abnormality rather than as a complex woman. He suggests that rather than locating Sor Juana in a fixed identity, scholarship on Sor Juana should be a fluctuating and multilayered conversation.\n\n\n==== Margaret Sayers Peden ====\nMargaret Sayers Peden's 1982 A Woman of Genius: The Intellectual Autobiography of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, was the first English translation of Sor Juana's work. As well, Peden is credited for her 1989 translation of Sor Juana: Or, the Traps of Faith. Unlike other translations, Peden chose to translate the title of Sor Juana's best known work, First Dream, as First I dream instead. Peden's use of first person instills authority in Sor Juana as an author, as a person with knowledge, in a male-dominated society. Peden also published her English translations of Sor Juana's work in an anthology called Poems, Protest, and a Dream. This work includes her response to authorities censuring her, La Respuesta, and First Dream.\n\n\n==== Electa Arenal and Amanda Powell ====\nAn equally valuable feminist analysis and interpretation of Sor Juana's life and work is found in The Answer/La Respuesta by Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz by Electa Arenal, a Sor Juana scholar who is recognized among feminists who changed America, and Amanda Powell, a poet and translator. The original publication, released in 1994 by The Feminist Press, was re-released in an updated second edition in 2009, also by The Feminist Press. The bilingual publication includes poems, an annotated publication of Sor Juana's response to church officials and her impassioned plea for education of women, analysis and a bibliography. The Answer applies a valuable gender lens to Sor Juana's writings and life. In their feminist analysis, Powell and Arenal translate the viewpoint of Sor Juana's writing as gender-ambiguous. Released in an updated second edition in 2009, also by The Feminist Press, the bilingual publication includes poems, an annotated publication of Sor Juana's response to church officials and her impassioned plea for education of women, analysis and a bibliography.\n\n\n==== Theresa A. Yugar ====\nTheresa A. Yugar, a feminist theologian scholar in her own right, has written her Master's and Doctoral theses on Sor Juana. She wrote Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz: Feminist Reconstruction of Biography and Text, a book in which she discusses the life of Sor Juana through a feminist lens and analyzes her texts, La Respuesta (The Answer) and El Primero Sue\u00f1o (First Dream).Yugar aims to understand why individuals in Mexico in the twenty-first century have more knowledge of Frida Kahlo than Sor Juana. She celebrates poet Octavio Paz for crossing national borders with his internationally acclaimed work on Sor Juana: Or, The Traps of Faith. However, while Paz establishes Sor Juana's historical relevance, Yugar expands on his work to establish Sor Juana's importance in the twenty-first century.Yugar argues that Sor Juana is the first female bibliophile in the New World. She also argues that Sor Juana's historic focus on gender and class equality in education (the public sphere) and the household (the private sphere), in addition to her advocacy for language rights, and the connection between indigenous religious traditions and ecological protection were paramount in the seventeenth century. Today's similar advocacy ignores her primal position in that work which is currently exclusively associated with ecofeminism and feminist theology.\n\n\n== Historical influence ==\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\n\nThe Sor Juana In\u00e9s Services for Abused Women was established in 1993 to pay Sor Juana's dedication to helping women survivors of domestic violence forward. Renamed the Community Overcoming Relationship Abuse (CORA), the organization offers community, legal, and family support services in Spanish to Latina women and children who have faced or are facing domestic violence.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nThe San Jer\u00f3nimo Convent, where Juana lived the last 27 years of her life and where she wrote most of her work is today the University of the Cloister of Sor Juana in the historic center of Mexico City. The Mexican government founded in the university in 1979.\n\n\n=== Political Controversy ===\nWhile Sor Juana was a famous and controversial figure in the seventeenth century, she is also an important figure in modern times.\nDuring renovations at the cloister in the 1970s, bones believed to be those of Sor Juana were discovered. A medallion similar to the one depicted in portraits of Juana was also found. Margarita L\u00f3pez Portillo, the sister of President Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo (1976-1982), kept the medallion. During the tercentennial of Sor Juana's death in 1995, a member of the Mexican congress called on Margarita L\u00f3pez Portillo to return the medallion, which she said she had taken for safekeeping. She returned it to Congress on November 14, 1995, with the event and description of the controversy reported in The New York Times a month later. Whether or not the medallion belonged to Juana, the incident sparked discussions about Juana and abuse of official power in Mexico.\n\n\n=== Contribution to feminism ===\n\n\n==== Historic feminist movements ====\nAmanda Powell locates Sor Juana as a contributor to the Querelles des Femmes, a three-century long literary debate about women. Central to this early feminist debate were ideas about gender and sex, and, consequently, misogyny.Powell argues that the formal and informal networks and pro-feminist ideas of the Querelles des Femmes were important influences on Sor Juana's work, La Respuesta. For women, Powell argues, engaging in conversation with other women was as significant as communicating through writing. However, while Teresa of Avila appears in Sor Juana's La Respuesta, Sor Juana makes no mention of the person who launched the debate, Christine de Pizan. Rather than focusing on Sor Juana's engagement with other literary works, Powell prioritizes Sor Juana's position of authority in her own literary discourse. This authoritative stance not only demonstrates a direct counter to misogyny, but was also typically reserved for men. As well, Sor Juana's argument that ideas about women in religious hierarchies are culturally constructed, not divine, echoes ideas about the construction of gender and sex.\n\n\n==== Modern feminist movements ====\nYugar connects Sor Juana to feminist advocacy movements in the twenty-first century, such as religious feminism, ecofeminism, and the feminist movement in general. \nAlthough the current religious feminist movement grew out of the Liberation Theology movement of the 1970s, Yugar uses Sor Juana's criticism of religious law that permits only men to occupy leadership positions within the church as early evidence of her religious feminism. Based on Sor Juana's critique of the oppressive and patriarchal structures of the church of her day, Yugar argues that Sor Juana predated current movements, like Latina Feminist Theology, that privilege Latina women's views on religion. She also cites modern movements such as the Roman Catholic Women Priest Movement, the Women's Ordination Conference, and the Women's Alliance for Theology, Ethics and Ritual, all of which also speak out against the patriarchal limitations on women in religious institutions.Yugar emphasizes that Sor Juana interpreted the Bible as expressing concern with people of all backgrounds as well as with the earth. Most significantly, Yugar argues, Sor Juana expressed concern over the consequences of capitalistic Spanish domination over the earth. These ideas, Yugar points out, are commonly associated with modern feminist movements concerned with decolonization and the protection of the planet.Alicia Gaspar de Alba connects Sor Juana to the modern lesbian movement and Chicana movement. She links Sor Juana to criticizing the concepts of compulsory heterosexuality and advocating the idea of a lesbian continuum, both of which are credited to well-known feminist writer and advocate Adrienne Rich. As well, Gaspar de Alba locates Sor Juana in the Chicana movement, which has not been accepting of Indigenous lesbians.\n\n\n=== A symbol ===\n\n\n==== Colonial and indigenous identities ====\nAs a woman in religion, Sor Juana has become associated with the Virgin of Guadalupe, a religious symbol of Mexican identity, but was also connected to Aztec goddesses. For example, parts of Sor Juana's Villancico 224 are written in Nahuatl, while others are written in Spanish. The Virgin of Guadalupe is the subject of the Villancico, but depending on the language, the poem refers to both the Virgin of Guadalupe and Cihuacoatl, an Indigneous goddess. It is ambiguous whether Sor Juana prioritizes the Mexican or indigenous religious figure, or whether her focus is on harmonizing the two.Sor Juana's connection to indigenous religious figures is also prominent in her Loa to Divine Narcissus, (Spanish \"El Divino Narciso\") (see Jauregui 2003, 2009). The play centers on the interaction between two Indigenous people, named Occident and America, and two Spanish people, named Religion and Zeal. The characters exchange their religious perspectives, and conclude that there are more similarities between their religious traditions than there are differences. The loa references Aztec rituals and gods, including Huitzilopochtli, who symbolized the land of Mexico.Scholars like Nicole Gomez argue that Sor Juana's fusion of Spanish and Aztec religious traditions in her Loa to Divine Narcissus aims to raise the status of indigenous religious traditions to that of Catholicism in New Spain. Gomez argues that Sor Juana also emphasizes the violence with which Spanish religious traditions dominated indigenous ones. Ultimately, Gomez argues that Sor Juana's use of both colonial and indigenous languages, symbols, and religious traditions not only gives voice to indigenous peoples, who were marginalized, but also affirms her own indigenous identity.Through their scholarly interpretations of Sor Juana's work, Octavio Paz and Alicia Gaspar de Alba have also incorporated Sor Juana into discourses about Mexican identity. Paz's accredited scholarship on Sor Juana elevated her to a national symbol as a Mexican woman, writer, and religious authority. On the contrary, Gaspar de Alba emphasized Sor Juana's indigenous identity by inserting her into Chicana discourses.\n\n\n==== Connection to Frida Kahlo ====\nPaul Allatson emphasizes that women like Sor Juana and Frida Kahlo masculinized their appearances to symbolically complicate the space marked for women in society. Sor Juana's decision to cut her hair as punishment for mistakes she made during learning signified her own autonomy, but was also a way to engage in the masculinity expected of male-dominated spaces, like universities. According to Paul Allatson, nuns were also required to cut their hair after entering the convent. These ideas, Allatson suggests, are echoed in Frida Kahlo's 1940 self-portrait titled Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair, or Autorretrato con cabellos corto.As well, the University of the Cloister of Sor Juana honored both Frida Kahlo and Sor Juana on October 31, 2018 with a symbolic altar. The altar, called Las Dos Juanas, was specially made for the Day of the Dead.\n\n\n==== Official recognition by the Mexican government ====\nIn present times, Sor Juana is still an important figure in Mexico. \nIn 1995, Sor Juana's name was inscribed in gold on the wall of honor in the Mexican Congress in April 1995. In addition, Sor Juana is pictured on the obverse of the 200 pesos bill issued by the Banco de Mexico, and the 1000 pesos coin minted by Mexico between 1988 and 1992. The town where Sor Juana grew up, San Miguel Nepantla in the municipality of Tepetlixpa, State of Mexico, was renamed in her honor as Nepantla de Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz.\n\n\n=== Inspiration and influence ===\n\nSor Juana has been the inspiration for film makers and authors of poetry, plays, opera, and literary fiction.\n\nAmerican composer John Adams and director Peter Sellars used two of Sor Juana's poems, Pues mi Dios ha nacido a penar and Pues est\u00e1 tiritando in their libretto for the Nativity oratorio-opera El Ni\u00f1o (2000).\nThe Spanish-language miniseries Juana In\u00e9s (2016) by Canal Once TV, starring Arantza Ruiz and Arcelia Ram\u00edrez as Sor Juana, dramatizes her life.\nMar\u00eda Luisa Bemberg wrote and directed the 1990 film Yo, la peor de todas (I, the Worst of All), based on Octavo Paz's Sor Juana: Or, the Traps of Faith based on Sor Juana's life.\nA telenovela about her life, Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, was created in 1962.\nDiane Ackerman wrote a dramatic verse play, Reverse Thunder, about Sor Juana (1992).\nJesusa Rodr\u00edguez has produced a number of works concerning Sor Juana, including Sor Juana en Almoloya and Striptease de Sor Juana, based on Juana's poem, \"Primero Sue\u00f1o\".\nCanadian novelist Paul Anderson devoted 12 years writing a 1300-page novel entitled Hunger's Brides (pub. 2004) on Sor Juana. His novel won the 2005 Alberta Book Award.\nComposer Allison Sniffin's original composition, \u00d3yeme con los ojos \u2013 (Hear Me with Your Eyes: Sor Juana on the Nature of Love), based on text and poetry by Sor Juana, was commissioned by Melodia Women's Choir, which premiered the work at the Kaufman Center in New York City.\nHelen Edmundson's play The Heresy of Love, based on the life of Sor Juana, was premiered by the Royal Shakespeare Company in early 2012 and revived by Shakespeare's Globe in 2015.\nComposer Daniel Crozier and librettist Peter M. Krask wrote With Blood, With Ink, an opera based around her life, while both were students at Baltimore's Peabody Institute in 1993. The work was premiered at Peabody and won first prize in the National Operatic and Dramatic Association's Chamber Opera Competition. In May 2000, excerpts from the opera were included in the New York City Opera's Showcasing American Composers Series. The work in its entirety was premiered by the Fort Worth Opera on April 20, 2014 and recorded by Albany Records.\nPuerto Rican singer iLe recites part of one of Sor Juana's sonnets in her song \"Rescatarme\".\nPlaywright, director, dramaturg, teacher, and producer Kenneth Prestininzi wrote Impure Thoughts (Without Apology) which follows Sor Juana's experience with Bishop Francisco Aguilar y Seijas. \"[2]\".\nCanadian poet and novelist Margaret Atwood's 2007 book of poems The Door includes a poem entitled \"Sor Juana Works in the Garden\".\nOn 12 November 2017, Google Doodle commemorated her 366th birthday.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThe Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz Project Dartmouth College.

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country.

In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts that allowed the team to rise again as one of the most important in the country.\n\nLa Paz F.C. : Founded in 1989, the club quickly rose through the ranks to become the third major club in the capital, only behind in popularity to the two well-established city rivals.The city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:\n\nAcademia de Balompi\u00e9 Boliviano\nAlways Ready\nChaco Petrolero\nClub 31 de Octubre\nDeportivo Municipal de La Paz\nFraternidad Tigres\nMariscal Braun\nUniversitario de La Paz\nClub Uni\u00f3n MaestranzaWith the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Uni\u00f3n Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the Estadio Hernando Siles, which also hosts the national football team and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times. The palace has been restored many times since, but the name has remained untouched.\n\n\n=== Principal attractions ===\n\n\n==== Museums and cultural centers ====\n\nThe former home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, martyr of the independence revolution of 1809, has been preserved and is now a museum.

In March 2012, more than 1.5 million vehicles were registered. Heavy traffic is common in the city center and traffic jams occur on peak hours.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nThe La Paz-El Alto Highway is a toll road that connects the city of La Paz with the neighboring city of El Alto. It is the city's main highway. It allows easy access to El Alto International Airport. The highway runs 11,7 km and crosses the city of El Alto:\n\n Autopista La Paz-El Alto/RN-3 (La Paz-El Alto Highway) - Connects La Paz with El Alto.\n Autov\u00eda La Paz Oruro/A-1 (La Paz-Oruro Highway)  - Connects La Paz with the cities of Oruro, Patacamaya and Caracollo. It then connects with Ruta Nacional 1/RN-1 (National Highway 1) heading south to the cities of Potos\u00ed, Camargo, Tarija.The Southern District, one of La Paz's most affluent and commercial neighborhoods, is relatively separated from the rest of the city, including the CBD. The Avenida Costanera and Avenida Kantutani (Costanera and Kantutani Avenues) connect the southern district with the rest of the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nEl Alto International Airport (IATA code: LPB) is La Paz's national and international airport and a principal hub for L\u00ednea A\u00e9rea Amaszonas and Transporte A\u00e9reo Militar. It also serves as a focus city for Boliviana de Aviaci\u00f3n, Bolivia's flag-carrier and largest airline. The airport is located in the city of El Alto and is (13 km) south-west of La Paz's city center. At an elevation of 4,061 metres (13,323 feet), it is the highest international airport and fifth highest commercial airport in the world. The runway has a length of 4,000 metres (2.5 mi). It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport.\nInternational carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca, LATAM Airlines and Peruvian Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, Santiago and Cusco. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft.\nAirport facilities include ATMs, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, car rentals, duty-free shops, and free Wi-Fi internet. Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines.\nThere are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

        "wiki": "San Pedro Sula (Spanish pronunciation: [san \u02c8ped\u027eo \u02c8sula]) is the capital of Cort\u00e9s Department, Honduras. It is located in the northwest corner of the country in the Sula Valley, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Puerto Cort\u00e9s on the Caribbean Sea. With a population of 661,190 in the central urban area (2019 calculation) and a population of 1,445,598 in its metropolitan area in 2019, it is the nation's primary industrial center and second largest city after the capital Tegucigalpa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe city grew slowly from about 800 residents in 1590, to almost 10,000 by the 1890s, but most of this population growth took place in the nineteenth century.  It benefitted initially from the growth of bananas for export in the 1870s and 1880s and formed a close relationship with US-based shipper and railroad entrepreneur Samuel Zemurray's Cuyamel Fruit Company, and the construction of the Interoceanic Railroad between 1869 and 1874 which connected the city to the coast at Puerto Cort\u00e9s. Zemurray worked closely with local elites who invested in subsidiary enterprises and thus shaped the way politically for Cuyamel to establish himself and to pay very few taxes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\nIn 2013, fifteen years after the effects of Hurricane Mitch, Honduras is one of the poorest countries in Latin America; around San Pedro Sula, banana production has not fully recovered, and \"manufacturing has all but dried up.\" The problems are exacerbated by organized gangs, whose rules prevent residents from safely leaving gang-controlled neighborhoods such as Chamelec\u00f3n for jobs in other parts of town.In 2000, then-Mayor Roberto Larios Silva said \"San Pedro Sula is where the economic development of the country is concentrated via the city's industrial, commercial and financial development.\"  The then-manager of Hotel Copantl attributed its growth in business-related tourism ...[to] the maquila (apparel \nmanufacturing) industry.As of 2011, San Pedro Sula generated two-thirds of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n\n== Crime ==\nSan Pedro Sula was the \"murder capital of the world\" until early 2016 when Caracas, Venezuela, surpassed its homicide rate. Since the 2009 Honduran military coup \"unemployment and underemployment rates have doubled while the number of people living in extreme poverty has skyrocketed.\" In 2013, the city had 187 homicides per 100,000 residents. This surpassed Ciudad Juarez, Mexico's rate of 148 killings per 100,000, or an average of about three homicides per day; Ciudad Juarez had previously topped the list for three consecutive years. Both cities are major operational and strategic distribution points in the illegal drug trade, particularly to the United States, and have significant gang activity. In response, authorities launched Operation Lightning, saturating violence hotspots with police and soldiers. Meanwhile, arms trafficking has flooded the country, with just under 70% of all firearms being illegal. 83% of homicides in the city involve firearms.According to the Los Angeles Times, \"the homicide rate is stoked by the rivalry of the brutal street gangs, mostly descendants of gangs formed in Los Angeles and deported to Central America in the 1990s, including Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and the 18th Street gang. Their ranks are fed by the disastrous economy of Honduras, and emboldened more recently by alliances with Mexican drug traffickers moving cocaine through the country.\"Crime and economic stress have led to the migration of large numbers of unaccompanied minors to the US border. The latest data from the CBP shows San Pedro Sula as the major source for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) migrating from Honduras.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSan Pedro Sula features a dry-summer Tropical monsoon climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Am), with year-round relatively high temperatures and plentiful rainfall year-round. San Pedro Sula has experienced hurricanes and tropical storms and is prone to them during the hurricane season usually when the storms form in the southern part of the Caribbean or Western Africa.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nSan Pedro Sula, as most cities built under the Spanish colonial period, is divided in quadrants.\nAvenues in the city run from north to south and streets run from east to west. First Street and First Avenue mark the \"center of the city\" and effectively divide it into four major quadrants NW, NE, SW and SE.\n\n\n=== Southwest ===\nBarrio El Benque, the business district, is just to the west and south of the center, and other neighborhoods in the suroeste include Barrio Paz Barahona, Barrio La Guardia, Colonia Altamira, Colonia Mesetas, Barrio R\u00edo de Piedras, Barrio Suyapa (from 12 Avenida S out to Avenida Circunvalaci\u00f3n, from 7 Calle S to 10 Calles S), Colonia Hernandez, Barrio Prado Alto, and Colonia El Chamelec\u00f3n. The latter includes area from 23 Avenida S west to 27 Avenida S, from 1 Calle (named Bulevar Los Pr\u00f3ceres there) south to 5 Calle S0. To the south of Colonia El Chamelec\u00f3n are Colonia Dub\u00f3n, Colonia Figueroa, Colonia Trejo (from 10 Calle S to 12 Calle S, from about Avenida Circunvalaci\u00f3n to 25 Avenida S, including the Consulate of Nicaragua), Colonia Altamira, and Colonia Altiplano. Colonia Las Mesetas runs from 12 Calle S to 14 Calle S, from 21 Avenida A (S) to past 24 Avenida S.\n\n\n=== Northwest ===\nBarrio Guamilito is just to the west and north of the center. Noroeste neighborhoods include Colonia Moderna (from 1 Calle to 5 Calle NO, from Avendia Circunvalaci\u00f3n to the river beyond 24 Avenida), Colonia La Mora (from 5 Calle NO to 7 Calle NO, from Avendia Circunvalaci\u00f3n to the r\u00edo beyond 24 Avenida), Colonia Zeron, the Colonia Columbia by the Universidad de San Pedro Sula, Barrio La Cervecer\u00eda and Barrio Guadalupe.  Across the river along which 24 Avenida runs is Colonia Juan Lindo and Colonia Jardines Del Valle.From the river past 24 Avenida, north to 25 Calle and west to 12 Avenida, is Colonia Universidad. Universidad de San Pedro Sula is to its south, across the river.  West of Colonia Universidad is Colonia Country, a small neighborhood including the Academia Americana, and Colonia Villas del Sol, which runs from Boulevard Mackey west to include Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Honduras en el Valle de Sula, and goes north to R\u00edo Bermejo but does not cross it.\n\nJust past the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de Honduras en el Valle de Sula, and spanning the R\u00edo Bermejo, is Colonia El Pedregal, which has residential high-rises.Further out, north across the R\u00edo Bermejo, running to the edge of the city, and with calles (streets) renumbering from 1 up, are Colonia Los Alpes and Rancho El Coco and Residencial Los Cedros and Colonia La Tara.Far to the north is Colonia Fesitranh.\n\n\n=== Northeast ===\nBarrio Las Acacias is just to the north of center. Nor-Este neighborhoods include Barrio San Cristobal, Villa Florencia, Colonia Ideal, Barrio Moraz\u00e1n, Colonia Modelo, and further out Colonia Bogr\u00e1n, Colonia El Carmen, and Colonia Los Laureles.\n\n\n=== Southeast ===\nIncludes the road to the airport, Aeropuerto Internacional Ramon Villeda Morales and to the city of La Lima.  Southeast neighborhoods include Barrio Medina (11 Calle SE to Avenida Juan Pablo II, 4 Avenida SO to 10 Avenida SE), Colonia La Aurora (defined by 7 Calle SE to 10 Calle SE, and 14 Avenida SE to Segundo Anilo (approximately where 18 Avenida would be), Barrio Caba\u00f1as, Barrio La Navidad, San Pedro, Barrio Las Palmas, Barrio San Lu\u00eds, Colonia La Uni\u00f3n, Barrio La Paz.  Farther out: Colonia Rivera Hern\u00e1ndez, San Cristobal.\n\n\n=== Chamelec\u00f3n ===\nWith dateline giving San Pedro Sula as the location, the New York Times in 2014 described the Chamelec\u00f3n district as a \"warren of modest cement-block houses painted in now chipped and fading pastels\", subject to pressure of street gangs. This is not the Colonia El Chamelec\u00f3n neighborhood within San Pedro Sula, but rather it is the Chamelec\u00f3n that lies outside to the south of San Pedro Sula, on the Chamelec\u00f3n River.\n\n\n=== Various ===\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe Villa Ol\u00edmpica is a multi-sporting complex that has facilities for most Olympic style games including football, boxing, swimming, baseball, cycling and multipurpose gymnasiums.San Pedro Sula is the only city in the country that houses to two football stadiums. The Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Metropolitano is located in the Villa Ol\u00edmpica and is the largest in the country with a capacity of 42,000. The Estadio Francisco Moraz\u00e1n is located in the center of the city and holds 23,000 people. The stadiums are home to San Pedro Sula's most popular professional football teams Marath\u00f3n and Real CD Espa\u00f1a.As of 2009, San Pedro Sula has been the home venue for Honduras national football team matches.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Cathedral ===\nIt has a Catholic cathedral that was built in 1949. as well as a Greek Orthodox cathedral, Iglesia Ortodoxa de Antioqu\u00eda San Juan Bautista, built in 1963.\n\n\n=== Currust\u00e9 ===\nThis archeological site is two kilometers along the street that goes to Lake Jucutuma.\nExpeditions from 2006 found multiple pre-Columbian pieces, and ruins of an unknown civilization. The ruins are currently abandoned since 2009, it was reported that during Rodolfo Sunseri administration in 2006-2009 that he pretended to rescue the park with 4 million Lempiras, but the project never started.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n San Pedro Sula travel guide from Wikivoyage\nHonduras Weekly\nUniversidad de San Pedro Sula",

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country.

In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts that allowed the team to rise again as one of the most important in the country.\n\nLa Paz F.C. : Founded in 1989, the club quickly rose through the ranks to become the third major club in the capital, only behind in popularity to the two well-established city rivals.The city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:\n\nAcademia de Balompi\u00e9 Boliviano\nAlways Ready\nChaco Petrolero\nClub 31 de Octubre\nDeportivo Municipal de La Paz\nFraternidad Tigres\nMariscal Braun\nUniversitario de La Paz\nClub Uni\u00f3n MaestranzaWith the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Uni\u00f3n Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the Estadio Hernando Siles, which also hosts the national football team and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times.

The airport is located in the city of El Alto and is (13 km) south-west of La Paz's city center. At an elevation of 4,061 metres (13,323 feet), it is the highest international airport and fifth highest commercial airport in the world. The runway has a length of 4,000 metres (2.5 mi). It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport.\nInternational carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca, LATAM Airlines and Peruvian Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, Santiago and Cusco. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft.\nAirport facilities include ATMs, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, car rentals, duty-free shops, and free Wi-Fi internet. Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines.\nThere are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

        "wiki": "This article lists the 3,143 counties and county equivalents of the United States. The 50 states of the United States are divided into 3,007 counties, political and geographic subdivisions of a state.  236 other local governments and geographic places are also first-order administrative divisions of their respective state/district/territory, but are called by different names. These are referred to collectively as county equivalents by the United States Census Bureau.  The 236 county equivalents include 100 equivalents in the territories (such as those in Puerto Rico) outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The large majority of counties and equivalents were organized by 1970.  Since that time, most creations, boundary changes and dissolutions have occurred in Alaska and Virginia.Among the 50 states, 44 are partitioned entirely into counties, with no county equivalents. Louisiana is instead divided into 64 equivalent parishes, while Alaska is divided into 19 equivalent boroughs and 11 sparsely populated census areas, the latter also known collectively as the unorganized borough.  Virginia is composed of a mixture of 95 counties and 38 independent cities.  Maryland, Missouri and Nevada are each composed entirely of counties, except that each also has exactly one independent city: Baltimore, St. Louis, and Carson City, respectively.  The District of Columbia is a single federal district that is not part of any state or county.  All of the above 136 exceptional cases are reckoned as county equivalents.  The number of counties (or equivalents) per state ranges from the three counties of Delaware, to the 254 counties of Texas.  In New England, where the town model predominates, several counties have no corresponding local governments, existing only as historical, legal, and census boundaries.  These are the counties of Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as 8 of Massachusetts' 14 counties. In all, the 50 states consist of 3,142 counties and equivalents. Adding the District of Columbia gives 3,143.\nSimilarly, the Census Bureau treats 100 subdivisions of the territories of the United States as county equivalents.  These are the 78 municipalities of Puerto Rico, the three major islands of the U.S. Virgin Islands, the three districts and two atolls of American Samoa, Guam as a single island and county equivalent, the four municipalities of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the nine island territories of the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands.  As in the states, each territorial county equivalent has its own INCITS/FIPS codes.\n\n\n== Table ==\nThe following sortable table lists the 3,243 counties and county equivalents of the United States with the following information for each entity:\n\nThe entity name\nThe state or equivalent (federal district or territory)\nThe population as of July 1, 2019, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau\nThe Core Based Statistical Area if designated by the Office of Management and Budget\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nOutline of the United States\nIndex of United States-related articles\nBook:United States\nIndex of U.S. counties\nLists of counties in the United States\nList of island counties of the United States\nList of former United States counties\nList of FIPS state codes\nList of United States FIPS codes by county\nThe OMB has defined 1098 statistical areas comprising 388 MSAs, 541 \u03bcSAs, and 169 CSAs\nPrimary statistical area \u2013 List of the 574 PSAs\nCombined Statistical Area \u2013 List of the 169 CSAs\nCore Based Statistical Area \u2013 List of the 929 CBSAs\nMetropolitan Statistical Area \u2013 List of the 388 MSAs\nMicropolitan Statistical Area \u2013 List of the 541 \u03bcSAs\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUnited States Government\nUnited States Census Bureau\nUnited States Office of Management and Budget",

          "This was definitely one of the best things in La Paz. An amazing experience and something you shouldn't miss when in La Paz",
          "One of the best things Ive ever done ! The staff was professional and really made you feel 100% safe. They only charge 150 Bolivianos for 1 jump. A must if you have never done that before. Would recommend doing abseiling with Urban Rush to everyone. And dont forget to tip ;-)",
          "Urban rush was great. The employees did an excellent job to prepare us. The costumes are a very nice touch. I went with what I imagine is the most popular--spiderman. My mom was not to thrilled when I sent her the pictures Urban Rush took.",
          "i really enjoyed this service, good guides, good equipment, and really good view of down town in La Paz.",
          "Brilliant experience. Very professional team. Good value for money and a must if you haven't done abseiling before.",
          "Super professional team, patient and clear in instructions in both English and Spanish. We felt comfortable with the safety setup and the jump was the most amazing experience! You have to do this if you're in La Paz you won't regret it.",
          "Super professional staff, extremely safe but oh so scary at the same time! A huge rush of adrenaline and great fun. Highly recommended for everyone!",
          "Professional guys, very helpful and fun. Good training before jump that make you feel a lot better, but scary it is anyway. Good price and cool experience.",
          "First thing you think with these kind of extreme sports is safety first. Urban rush is just doing that, make you feel safe. They give you loads of information and time for training to make you feel more confident. Let's be honest: everyone that jumps out of a window of a",
          "As much of a tourist-centric activity this is, don't miss out. It's an incredible experience. Definitely scary when they keep telling you \"lean forward more, more, MORE!\" when you're 17 stories up, but when it's all said and done, you'll want it do it again. I regret not doing",
          "This is the last thing I did at the end of 3 days in La Paz - yesterday I did the Death Road and today I abseiled down the big green building in the middle of La Paz! Great views from the 17th floor of Hotel President, very safe, and the staff really do take the utmost care of",
          "When I read that I could run of a building dressed as spiderman, I was in. I had a great time. The instructors are knowledgeable, professional and gave me a good practice run before going for the real deal. I had a lot of fun! Also, it's not expensive at all.",
          "So when I looked up the 17 stories where people were dropping out of, I thought...OK shouldn't be a problem.., then when I got up there and looked out the window and down, I thought there is no way I'm doing this.... but I HAVE to I thought.. I can't wimp out. So without giving",
          "It was a breath-taking experience. It is totally safe to get down the building having in mind that the personnel there is well-trained and caring. But you need to overcome your own fear and make the first step. Everything else would be handled by the guys who work there.",
          "My highlight of LaPaz, Urban Rush was incredibly fun and safe. There were three staff members and they were all very knowledgeable and spoke perfect English. It was great value for money and would recommend to anyone who enjoys an adrenaline rush.",
          "It was super quite the afternoon we did it so we had the place to ourselves, the guides were kind and thorough with training. It's terrifying but make sure you do it twice. Once isn't enough! Also, riding the elevator up dressed up as batman is worth paying money for.",
          "Great fun, amazingly safe and we'll worth a visit. Right In Town!! The guys there were really nice and spoke great English.",
          "You will never forget this experience! First I was really scared. But after the instructions of a very competent and professional team I felt safe enough to walk and jump down the building. Thank you for that great experience!!!",
          "Yesterday I did the rappelling through Urban Rush. The staff was incredibly helpful and patient, and - most importantly - professional and personable. The staff put me at ease and made me feel so comfortable that I (surprisingly) didn't have any butterflies when I walked out",
          "A must do! Awesome fun and the team are so friendly and experienced that they make you feel safe and as relaxed as possible for sepping out of the 17th floor! They take lots of pics for free so you can remember the experience and put on their facebook page.",
          "For my 30th birthday by boyfriend surprised me with this. Best surprise ever! So I donned my Spider-Man attire and abseiled face first off the building. It was great fun. Unfortunately the wall is very slippy and converse don't have much grip, so I may have slipped down most",
          "Jumping out of this 17 storey building confirmed to me that I am, in fact, scared of heights. But the rush I got from seeing it through was totally worth the panic attack. The staff were so patient, and the training was as thorough as could be. Getting to wear costumes was a",
          "Im not good with heights - the title might hint at that but I like to try things like this. I really wasnt sure if I could do it but the staff were patient and helped me fight my fear. Did two drops first going backwards which helped my confidence then I actually did a forward",
          "Urban Rush. Great name. I told myself I would do it. I went there to check it out first. Looks scary as hell from the top and I didn't think I could do it. But I made a promise to myself. Here's a video of my jump. http://bit.ly/1P0mx7q",
          "A must do in La Paz! One of the best things I've ever done! I just arrived with no booking and the guys had me going down the building in no time! They were all very professional, patient and fun :)",
          "Myself and a friend called up to urban rush not fully sure would we do the activity...... A staff member showed us around, put zero pressure on us to partake and left us space to decide. I decided to do it front facing (and in a Spider-Man suit :) ) which was new for me and I",
          "This place is amazing! It is an adventure in a building! I went there once, and regret I haven't gone again! You are given classes for about 10 minutes and then you rappel down the building. Great place! Strongly recommend \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",
          "Urban Rush Bolivia has given me the adrenaline rush of a lifetime. I strolled into Hotel Presidente with my boyfriend (no reservation required) and I was met with an extremely friendly and funny staff. They were all able to speak fluently in both Spanish and English, which was a",
          "No reservation required, rocked up and we picked novelty suits to wear (hotdog, bacon, Spider-Man) before a tutorial on how to use the gear on the small indoor practice wall. Very professional staff, felt safe, great views and adrenaline rush and they share their photos on",
          "this is a great little day activity if youve got some time to spare and feel like going a bit crazy. Takes about 45mins-1hr all in all, and if youre nervous you can practice on the inside wall as much as you like, the staff are really helpful and cool people so they put you at",
          "This is an awesome experience! It's located inside the hotel across from Plaza San Francisco, and you can go directly to the floor. Once you walk into the hotel, there are signs everywhere to help (in English!). Once you get there, you can put your stuff in a locker. The staff",
          "My boyfriend amd I decided we would rather walk down the side of a building than take our chances on death road. The staff here were super friendly and supportive. I freaked out a few times trying to go face first. But the staff were coached me and eventually got me out that",
          "Going down a building face first - and the free fall!! What could be better!?? A great experience! Great fun!! And a great team!! Well done guys!!",
          "Great value for the adrenaline rush, very safe, helpful and friendly english speaking staff, thanks guys!",
          "Totally recommend!! The people were so friendly. Of course I was scared but they make me really comfortable. It is safe and you can practise before you start.",
          "Amazing movement ever in life I ever saw. Just wanted to go again with my love. Waiting in bolivia hope will go soon",
          "Words fail to describe just how fun Urban Rush is, this is very simply a must do if you are in La Paz for any quantity of time! Make space for this in your schedule as it will likely be the highlight of your stay in this city. The staff are wonderfully friendly and always",
          "The face first rappel was awesome and also the free fall was cool. In addition, the view from the top is awesome.",
          "Did this yesterday and it was so much fun! I only did one rapel; I had to go get a bus, but the staff were great and I would definitely recommend doing it. Total time was about 40 mins including suiting up&training&the drop. I went face first and got to free fall. I was the",
          "I admitted i chickened out a day before, but I plucked up courage and glad I did it. They are patient and professional, and you feel very safe. It also makes you feel better to see everyone else before look scared.",
          "Amazing experience. Totally safe. Mini rappel in the hotel to practice on before you exit the building. Great prices too!",
          "Jumping off 17 stories. Super safe super fun, you get to free fall as well. Great way to get your heart rate up if you're into that.",
          "I really enjoyed this simple attraction. Big wall ... Off you go. You have the choice to absail down or go forward, the latter being a little bit more adventurous. Funny costumes, all over them! Very well priced at about 10 dollars. Take the leap.",
          "I found this adventure online while researching for \"what to do\" in La Paz. So, if you are an Adrenalin Junkie you HAVE to do this! I saw the building from the bottom and thought \"well it's quite high\". Then I went up to Urban Rush and saw it from above and thought \"oh my god,",
          "The guides are super expirenced, very patient and english speakers! Makes you feel very safe and at the same time the andrenaline rush! Very recommended!",
          "Its fun, a bit short but the lcompany is really professional.. I really recommand it ...............",
          "I didn't expect this to be as great and terrifying as it was. I've bungeed, skydived, done death road, etc but walking off the edge of that building was almost impossible for me to do. Afterwards it was just plain fun! And the free-fall was the best part!!! Cheap, quick, fun",
          "I had jumped off the Stratosphere in Vegas before so I was pumped to do this. They gave us two options, face first or backwards. I thought backwards was pretty lame so I chose face first. The staff was very professional and made sure we were safe. They were very experienced.",
          "Such an amazing thing to do and very safe! Staff are so so so lovely! I think my husband enjoyed it more than me but I am so proud of myself for doing it.",
          "It was lots of fun! We felt that the team is very experienced and it's really safe! Totally recommendable",
          "I was slightly terrified but the guides were great -- professional and safety conscious. It's an awesome way to see the whole city sprawled out in front of you and it's super cheap at just 15 quid! You receive a full briefing first and then away you go - with the guides above",
          "One of my friends told me about Urban Rush so I wanted to try it out. I got there and have to admit that I was pretty terrified. But the guides made me feel extremely comfortable with the equipment and training and I'm so glad I did it. I definitely recommend it to everyone!",
          "It seemed so easy when we were practicing. When my turn came, I chickened out. I couldn't do it! Good thing the staff assured me that they will be guiding me all the way. That day, I learned to let go! Their gears are very safe and the crew are very experienced. You don't have",
          "We did skydiving and bungee jumping, we thought we wont enjoy this as we've done the extreme before! Well, my partner and I together with a friend just did it today! We super like it! I used the spiderman costume while Jon used the batman costume! ha! I love the free fall! The",
          "Unbelievably true, you can actually go down like spiderman. rush of adrenaline all the time and you feel like you are going to end smashed. Good experience!",
          "Incredible experience you could have in the middle of LA Paz. It was fast fun and beyond. It was the best Bolivians we spent.",
          "The staff were excellent - very helpful and made me feel safe the whole way down. It's not everyday you get to abseil down a hotel in the middle of a city, and this experience is certainly unique and worthwhile doing at least once.",
          "Loved it was there in february 2013 and it simply was an Urban Rush :) The last bit was done in free fall and never had my heart beating so fast in my life.",
          "Been to La Paz Bolivia In March this year, we paid the full price not the discounted tour price to start of with. Once we got there asking about safety we were faced with a really moody woman who didn't really seem interested. when we asked about the picutures they said they",

          "After our free city walk we had the opportunity to go rapelling down the building. It was the 15th floor of a fancy hotel. With the sun out and the square nearby, it was a nice environment to walk down a building. We picked a funny costume, were suited up, got instructions,",
          "Cheap as chips and highly fun! dress up as superheroes and descend down a big massive building in the middle of La Paz, it is what it is..... QUALITY!!! the free fall in particular was wicked!! highly recommend it, get it done!!!",
          "They had all the equipment i needed and were friendly and patient i felt safe all the way downdown i would do it all over again once im back in la paz the price is also good cause is really cheap ...and you get the chance to have a look at presidente hotel five stars and",
          "This was great!! Get to dress up like a superhero (or a piece of bacon..) and walk down the side of a building. My only regret: the building is slippery! It's hard to keep your fees on the side and actually \"walk\" - maybe bring some grippy shoes with you!",
          "It was definitely what I was looking for-a safe but exhilerating experience in Bolivia. It didn't cost too much and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in going off the beaten trail in Bolivia.",
          "It was the first time I did such an activity. I was a little bit scared at the beginning but the staff trained me first and I really felt safed all time long. I really recommend to do it if you spend some days in La Paz! Such an amazing Experience!!!!!!!",
          "Really loved this activity - it was a huge adrenalin rush and something completely different. It was also very cheap for what it was - $20 to scale and abseil down a building! We had to wait a bit until a decent sized group assembled, but the views were pretty fab so no",
          "Everything about Urban Rush was incredible. They were super friendly, and made sure you were 100% comfortable before starting the descent. Plus, you get to wear your favorite superhero's costume! The only thing I would recommend is to bring Bolivianos. I had to pay in dollars",
          "I did the rappelling down the side of a building and it was awesome. They have superhero costumes (including spiderman and a strip of bacon) to make it even better: Staff may have seemed unprofessional because they were all young and playing with each others hair and smoking,",
          "I loved doing this! You get a nice discount if you do the free walking tour first and mention the Red Caps. The staff is very helpfull and you get to wear a nice spiderman suit if you want to. They explain everything clear and actually it's not that hard to do. But it's a lot of",
          "I was a little nervous because of the height and the cheap price (100 bolivianos when you do the Red Cap free walking tour) but they were very friendly and professional. Two safety ropes with one person at the top and one at the bottom. Really fun experience.",
          "If you are in La Paz Urban Rush is a must do! I guess you already know what the attraction is all about if you're reading this. Its worth doing the Free City Tour as this gives you 50bs off your jump; if not just turn up and pay the 150bs. The staff were really good and they",
          "If you're in La Paz and not too afraid of heights, then this should be right up your street. Get a taxi to take you to El Presidente hotel, take the lift inside the hotel to the top, 2 flights of stairs and you're there. Sign away your disclaimer, suit up, harness up, then",
          "What an experience the day after The Death Road mountain bike...this was an amazing thrill so much so that we went upstairs and jumped out again... loved the clown outfits too made me feel like a puppet, I loved the freefall the most.",

          "this takes just an hour to do ... it is fun filled adrenalin rush ... less cheap and well worth the experience ... YOU MUST DO THIS ...",
          "Decided to do this after our bus was delayed. Staff were very professional and well trained, felt vey safe and comfortable. Well worth it - best thing I did in La Paz!",
          "All the staff was encouraging and helpful getting you to lean out the window looking down 17 stories. Made you feel safe and secure on a scary thing to do. Was fun and a good time. Must do when you are in La Paz. Great way to end the Red Cap free walking tour.",
          "Good adrenaline rush, felt safe at all times, especially since they had a small training wall inside to practice on first! Staff very nice",
          "I'm terrified of heights but still loved it, do it in the bacon costume and you can do it with the camera helmet",

          "The free fall is well worth it. Great view of the city and a cool buzz abseiling down the side of the build. Plenty of costumes to dress up in also!",
          "I'm an adrenaline junkie and I loved it! The staff are super friendly and helpful! They even took pictures of me on my camera while scaling the wall. We also go to wear spiderman suits which I think was frosting on the cake. They have had no accidents and the thing could not be",
          "If you go to La Paz make sure you do this. The free walking tour finishes here, which is also one of the best things to do in La Paz.So you have the option to pay $20 to absail down 17 stories, so much fun.",
          "Urban Rush is a professional, safe, well run, adrenalin kick that is without a doubt one of the most fun things you can do in downtown La Paz. If you can get over your fear of heights then don't miss this amazing experience.",
          "Professional and well organised. It was a unique experience and a thrill for my daughter. The photos were a bonus",
          "So high, so good! After you paid, you wouldn't have your money back if you finally would like to stay... so we go down...",
          "This experience was AMAZING. I will definitely recommend it. I have never felt so safe doing adventure. The staff was very kind, and explained all the safety rules in good English. Very understanding if you were afraid of the heights, and very patient on the practice wall if you",
          "This company is very well organized and has all the right safety equipment. Going down just once was more than enough of a thrill. They explain everything in English extremely well. Gear is extremely well maintained and safe. No issue running down the side of a hotel with an",
          "Fun way to spend part of your tour of the city, but I feel it is slightly overrated. The people at the organisation are really well trained and let you take as much time as you need getting used to the feeling of walking down vertically. A good stepping stone into adventure",
          "Just the most amazing rush, incredible fun, totally safe but utterly terrifying, you will truly test yourself, whilst dressed as a superhero! The staff here are incredibly professional, the set-up is infinitely superior to absolutely anything else I have seen in Bolivia, and the",
          "Going down a 17 storey building head first was not on the to do list when coming to la paz but I am so glad I went ahead with it. From start to finish this is a totally brilliant experience. The staff make you feel confident and safe throughout and all speak English. The plot",
          "This is a 50m rappel from a building downtown in La Paz. You can go Australian style (face-first) which is totally awesome. They teach you how to do it, and you can dress up in crazy costumes. I was santa claus with a superhero mask on. The rappel offers a good view of downtown,",
          "So I've done abseiling before, I do a lot of rock climbing but this was so differnt, first off: YOU'RE GOING FORWARDS, but this is optional, but I HIGHLY recommend it. Like I said, I've done a lot of climbing and these guys were totally professional. All the gear looked well",
          "It's something to do that's different in the city. The staff were great and made me feel very safe. Suggestion: GO TWICE! It is so inexpensive if you pay upfront and you can rappel one time and go face first the other.",

          "I did this after being egged on by my 10 year old daughter (who, incidentally, was too young to do it!). The training was adequate, though the guide only gave the demonstration in spanish (as the majority of people in our group were spanish), but english training is given if you",

          "I am so glad I did this! It is the biggest rush ever and I felt totally safe. The guys at Urban Rush are really professional and so friendly - they made me feel totally safe even though I was terrified to begin with!! Thank you, Urban Rush - I had a ball!!",

          "So courteous and helpful. I felt so safe and would do it a million times over. I recommend going down face first and to also do it twice. Your first round you get used to it! Urban Rush was a thrilling experience.",
          "Considering you are repelling off a building in the middle of a city (literally smack in the middle) you'd think it would require expertise or at least a lengthy 'how to' session but the whole thing took 20 minutes. Perfect fun and easy activity when seeing La Paz. If you are",
          "Ive never come across this before, its a unique, fun and cheap thing to do during your visit to La Paz. You dont need to book, you just turn up. You have the choice of a standard orange suit or a fun but slightly stinky fancy dress suit (batman, catwoman, santa, spiderman,",

        "wiki": "Tiwanaku (Spanish: Tiahuanaco or Tiahuanacu) is a Pre-Columbian archaeological site in western Bolivia near Lake Titicaca and one of the largest sites in South America. Surface remains currently cover around 4 square kilometers and include decorated ceramics, monumental structures, and megalithic blocks. The site's population probably peaked around AD 800 with 10,000 to 20,000 people.The site was first recorded in written history in 1549 by Spanish conquistador Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n while searching for the southern Inca capital of Qullasuyu.Some have hypothesized that Tiwanaku's modern name is related to the Aymara term taypiqala, meaning \"stone in the center\", alluding to the belief that it lay at the center of the world. The name by which Tiwanaku was known to its inhabitants may have been lost as they had no written language. Heggarty and Beresford-Jones suggest that the  Puquina language is most likely to have been the language of Tiwanaku.\n\n\n== Antiquity ==\nThe age of the site has been significantly refined over the last century. From 1910 to 1945, Arthur Posnansky maintained that the site was 11,000\u201317,000 years old based on comparisons to geological eras and archaeoastronomy. Beginning in the 1970s, Carlos Ponce Sangin\u00e9s proposed the site was first occupied around 1580 BC, the site's oldest radiocarbon date. This date is still seen in some publications and museums in Bolivia. Since the 1980s, researchers have recognized this date as unreliable, leading to the consensus that the site is no older than 200 or 300 BC. Most recently, a statistical assessment of reliable radiocarbon dates estimates that the site was founded around AD 110 (50\u2013170, 68% probability), a date supported by the lack of ceramic styles from earlier periods.\n\n\n== Structures ==\nThe structures that have been excavated by researchers at Tiwanaku include the Akapana, Akapana East, and Pumapunku stepped platforms, the Kalasasaya, the Kheri Kala, and Putin enclosures, and the Semi-Subterranean Temple. These may be visited by the public.\nThe Akapana is an approximately cross-shaped pyramidal structure that is 257 m wide, 197 m broad at its maximum, and 16.5 m tall. At its center appears to have been a sunken court. This was nearly destroyed by a deep looters excavation that extends from the center of this structure to its eastern side. Material from the looter's excavation was dumped off the eastern side of the Akapana. A staircase with sculptures is present on its western side. Possible residential complexes might have occupied both the northeast and southeast corners of this structure.\nOriginally, the Akapana was thought to have been developed from a modified hill. Twenty-first-century studies have shown that it is an entirely manmade earthen mound, faced with a mixture of large and small stone blocks. The dirt comprising Akapana appears to have been excavated from the \"moat\" that surrounds the site. The largest stone block within the Akapana, made of andesite, is estimated to weigh 65.7 tonnes. The structure was possibly for the shaman-puma relationship or transformation through shape shifting. Tenon puma and human heads stud the upper terraces.\n\nThe Akapana East was built on the eastern side of early Tiwanaku. Later it was considered a boundary between the ceremonial center and the urban area. It was made of a thick, prepared floor of sand and clay, which supported a group of buildings. Yellow and red clay were used in different areas for what seems like aesthetic purposes. It was swept clean of all domestic refuse, signaling its great importance to the culture.The Pumapunku is a man-made platform built on an east-west axis like the Akapana. It is a rectangular, terraced earthen mound faced with megalithic blocks. It is 167.36 m wide along its north-south axis and 116.7 m broad along its east-west axis and is 5 m tall. Identical 20-meter-wide projections extend 27.6 meters north and south from the northeast and southeast corners of the Pumapunku. Walled and unwalled courts and an esplanade are associated with this structure.\nA prominent feature of the Pumapunku is a large stone terrace; it is 6.75 by 38.72 meters in dimension and paved with large stone blocks. It is called the \"Plataforma L\u00edtica\". The Plataforma L\u00edtica contains the largest stone block found in the Tiwanaku site. According to Ponce Sangines, the block is estimated to weigh 131 metric tons. The second-largest stone block found within the Pumapunku is estimated to be 85 metric tons.\n\nThe Kalasasaya is a large courtyard more than 300 feet long, outlined by a high gateway. It is located to the north of the Akapana and west of the Semi-Subterranean Temple. Within the courtyard is where explorers found the Gateway of the Sun. Since the late 20th century, researchers have theorized that this was not the gateway's original location.\nNear the courtyard is the Semi-Subterranean Temple; a square sunken courtyard that is unique for its north-south rather than east-west axis. The walls are covered with tenon heads of many different styles, suggesting that the structure was reused for different purposes over time. It was built with walls of sandstone pillars and smaller blocks of Ashlar masonry. The largest stone block in the Kalasasaya is estimated to weigh 26.95 metric tons.Within many of the site's structures are impressive gateways; the ones of monumental scale are placed on artificial mounds, platforms, or sunken courts. Many gateways show iconography of the Staff God. This iconography also is used on some oversized vessels, indicating an importance to the culture. This iconography is most present on the Gateway of the Sun.The Gateway of the Sun and others located at Pumapunku are not complete. They are missing part of a typical recessed frame known as a chambranle, which typically have sockets for clamps to support later additions. These architectural examples, as well as the recently discovered Akapana Gate, have unique detail and demonstrate high skill in stone-cutting. This reveals a knowledge of descriptive geometry. The regularity of elements suggests they are part of a system of proportions.\n\nMany theories for the skill of Tiwanaku's architectural construction have been proposed. One is that they used a luk\u2019 a, which is a standard measurement of about sixty centimeters. Another argument is for the Pythagorean Ratio. This idea calls for right triangles at a ratio of five to four to three used in the gateways to measure all parts. Lastly, Protzen and Nair argue that Tiwanaku had a system set for individual elements dependent on context and composition. This is shown in the construction of similar gateways ranging from diminutive to monumental size, proving that scaling factors did not affect proportion. With each added element, the individual pieces were shifted to fit together.As the population grew, occupational niches developed, and people began to specialize in certain skills. There was an increase in artisans, who worked in pottery, jewelry, and textiles. Like the later Inca, the Tiwanaku had few commercial or market institutions. Instead, the culture relied on elite redistribution. That is, the elites of the empire controlled essentially all economic output but were expected to provide each commoner with all the resources needed to perform his or her function. Selected occupations include agriculturists, herders, pastoralists, etc. Such separation of occupations was accompanied by hierarchical stratification within the empire.The elites of Tiwanaku lived inside four walls that were surrounded by a moat. This moat, some believe, was to create the image of a sacred island. Inside the walls were many images devoted to human origin, which only the elites would see. Commoners may have entered this structure only for ceremonial purposes since it was home to the holiest of shrines.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\n\nAs the site has suffered from looting and amateur excavations since shortly after Tiwanaku's fall, archeologists must attempt to interpret it with the understanding that materials have been jumbled and destroyed. This destruction continued during the Spanish conquest and colonial period, and during 19th century and the early 20th century. Other damage was committed by people quarrying stone for building and railroad construction, and target practice by military personnel.\nNo standing buildings have survived at the modern site. Only public, non-domestic foundations remain, with poorly reconstructed walls. The ashlar blocks used in many of these structures were mass-produced in similar styles so that they could possibly be used for multiple purposes. Throughout the period of the site, certain buildings changed purposes, causing a mix of artifacts found today.Detailed study of Tiwanaku began on a small scale in the mid-nineteenth century. In the 1860s, Ephraim George Squier visited the ruins and later published maps and sketches completed during his visit. German geologist Alphons St\u00fcbel spent nine days in Tiwanaku in 1876, creating a map of the site based on careful measurements. He also made sketches and created paper impressions of carvings and other architectural features. A book containing major photographic documentation was published in 1892 by engineer Georg von Grumbkow, With commentary by archaeologist Max Uhle, this was the first in-depth scientific account of the ruins.\nVon Grumbkow had first visited Tiwanaku between the end of 1876 and the beginning of 1877, when he accompanied as a photographer the expedition of French adventurer Th\u00e9odore Ber, financed by American businessman Henry Meiggs, against Ber\u2019s promise of donating the artifacts he will find, on behalf of Meiggs, to Washington's Smithsonian Institution and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Ber\u2019s expedition was cut short by the violent hostility of the local population, instigated by the Catholic parish priest, but von Grumbkow\u2019s early pictures survive.\nPictures of archaeological excavations in 1903\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Contemporary excavation and restoration ===\n\nIn the 1960s, the Bolivian government initiated an effort to restore the site and reconstruct part of it. The walls of the Kalasasaya are almost all reconstructed. The original stones making up the Kalasasaya would have resembled a more \"Stonehenge\"-like style, spaced evenly apart and standing straight up. The reconstruction was not sufficiently based on research; for instance, a new wall was built around Kalasasaya. The reconstruction does not have as high quality of stonework as was present in Tiwanaku. As noted, the Gateway of the Sun, now in the Kalasasaya, is believed to have been moved from its original location.Modern, academically sound archaeological excavations were performed from 1978 through the 1990s by University of Chicago anthropologist Alan Kolata and his Bolivian counterpart, Oswaldo Rivera. Among their contributions are the rediscovery of the suka kollus, accurate dating of the civilization's growth and influence, and evidence for a drought-based collapse of the Tiwanaku civilization.\nArchaeologists such as Paul Goldstein have argued that the Tiwanaku empire ranged outside of the altiplano area and into the Moquegua Valley in Peru. Excavations at Omo settlements show signs of similar architecture characteristic of Tiwanaku, such as a temple and terraced mound. Evidence of similar types of cranial vault modification in burials between the Omo site and the main site of Tiwanaku is also being used for this argument.\n\nToday Tiwanaku has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, administered by the Bolivian government.\nRecently, the Department of Archaeology of Bolivia (DINAR, directed by Javier Escalante) has been conducting excavations on the Akapana pyramid. The Proyecto Arqueologico Pumapunku-Akapana (Pumapunku-Akapana Archaeological Project, PAPA) run by the University of Pennsylvania, has been excavating in the area surrounding the pyramid for the past few years, and also conducting Ground Penetrating Radar surveys of the area.\nIn former years, an archaeological field school offered through Harvard's Summer School Program, conducted in the residential area outside the monumental core, has provoked controversy amongst local archaeologists. The program was directed by Dr. Gary Urton, of Harvard, who was an expert on quipus, and Dr. Alexei Vranich of the University of Pennsylvania. The controversy was over allowing a team of untrained students to work on the site, even under professional supervision. It was so important that only certified professional archaeologists with documented funding were allowed access. The controversy was charged with nationalistic and political undertones. The Harvard field school lasted for three years, beginning in 2004 and ending in 2007. The project was not renewed in subsequent years, nor was permission sought to do so.\nIn 2009 state-sponsored restoration work on the Akapana pyramid was halted due to a complaint from UNESCO. The restoration had consisted of facing the pyramid with adobe, although researchers had not established this as appropriate.In 2013, marine archaeologists exploring Lake Titicaca's Khoa reef discovered an ancient ceremonial site and lifted artefacts such as a lapis lazuli and ceramic figurines, incense burners and a ceremonial medallion from the lake floor. The artifacts are representative of the lavishness of the ceremonies and the Tiwanaku culture.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBermann, Marc Lukurmata Princeton University Press (1994) ISBN 978-0-691-03359-4.\nBruhns, Karen Olsen, Ancient South America, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, c. 1994.\nGoldstein, Paul, \"Tiwanaku Temples and State Expansion: A Tiwanaku Sunken-Court Temple in Moduegua, Peru\", Latin American Antiquity, Vol. 4, No. 1 (March 1993), pp. 22\u201347, Society for American Archaeology.\nHoshower, Lisa M., Jane E.

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country. In the year 1964 was a bad year, and it lost the category, playing the next year in the second category, but returning afterwards.The Strongest : Founded in 1908 the club hosts some of its games and trains on their home stadium named Rafael Mendoza after Don Rafael Mendoza, one of the most important presidents of the club. In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts that allowed the team to rise again as one of the most important in the country.\n\nLa Paz F.C. : Founded in 1989, the club quickly rose through the ranks to become the third major club in the capital, only behind in popularity to the two well-established city rivals.The city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:\n\nAcademia de Balompi\u00e9 Boliviano\nAlways Ready\nChaco Petrolero\nClub 31 de Octubre\nDeportivo Municipal de La Paz\nFraternidad Tigres\nMariscal Braun\nUniversitario de La Paz\nClub Uni\u00f3n MaestranzaWith the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Uni\u00f3n Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the Estadio Hernando Siles, which also hosts the national football team and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times. The palace has been restored many times since, but the name has remained untouched.\n\n\n=== Principal attractions ===\n\n\n==== Museums and cultural centers ====\n\nThe former home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, martyr of the independence revolution of 1809, has been preserved and is now a museum.

In March 2012, more than 1.5 million vehicles were registered. Heavy traffic is common in the city center and traffic jams occur on peak hours.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nThe La Paz-El Alto Highway is a toll road that connects the city of La Paz with the neighboring city of El Alto. It is the city's main highway. It allows easy access to El Alto International Airport. The highway runs 11,7 km and crosses the city of El Alto:\n\n Autopista La Paz-El Alto/RN-3 (La Paz-El Alto Highway) - Connects La Paz with El Alto.\n Autov\u00eda La Paz Oruro/A-1 (La Paz-Oruro Highway)  - Connects La Paz with the cities of Oruro, Patacamaya and Caracollo. It then connects with Ruta Nacional 1/RN-1 (National Highway 1) heading south to the cities of Potos\u00ed, Camargo, Tarija.The Southern District, one of La Paz's most affluent and commercial neighborhoods, is relatively separated from the rest of the city, including the CBD. The Avenida Costanera and Avenida Kantutani (Costanera and Kantutani Avenues) connect the southern district with the rest of the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nEl Alto International Airport (IATA code: LPB) is La Paz's national and international airport and a principal hub for L\u00ednea A\u00e9rea Amaszonas and Transporte A\u00e9reo Militar. It also serves as a focus city for Boliviana de Aviaci\u00f3n, Bolivia's flag-carrier and largest airline. The airport is located in the city of El Alto and is (13 km) south-west of La Paz's city center. At an elevation of 4,061 metres (13,323 feet), it is the highest international airport and fifth highest commercial airport in the world. The runway has a length of 4,000 metres (2.5 mi). It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport.\nInternational carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca, LATAM Airlines and Peruvian Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, Santiago and Cusco. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft.\nAirport facilities include ATMs, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, car rentals, duty-free shops, and free Wi-Fi internet. Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines.\nThere are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

        "wiki": "The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption (Spanish: Catedral Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n), located in the city of Oaxaca de Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico, is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Antequera, Oaxaca. Its construction began in 1535 and it was consecrated on 12 July 1733. It is dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption.\n\n\n== History ==\nConstruction began in 1535, during which the Temple of San Juan de Dios temporarily served as the cathedral church of the diocese.  In 1640, the cathedral was installed and the seat of the diocese was transferred to Our Lady of the Assumption. Due to earthquakes in the 16th and 18th centuries, the cathedral had to be reconstructed several times, with the most recent reconstruction beginning in 1702 and finishing in 1733.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nIts facade is made of green cantera stone commonly found in Oaxaca's buildings, and the interior is in Neoclassical style. The altar features a statue of Our Lady of the Assumption (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n) which was made in Italy during the Porfirian era, who is represented by a bronze sculpture brought from Europe and made by Tadoini.The towers of the cathedral are not the originals, as they were destroyed in 1931 by an earthquake. In the south there is a clock donated to Oaxaca by King Fernando VII. The Lord of Lightning is in the last chapel on the left, while the second on the right contains the remains of the Cross of Huatulco.

          "Pretty little church inside and out. The tower is the perfect place to watch the parrots and swallows come home to roost around 5:30 pm.",
          "There is something peaceful about this place. I am Jewish so it cannot be religion but an ambiance. Very nice place to watch sunset from the top and hear the birds coming back. Parque santander is good at any time of the day but best at sunset",
          "Like most things in this area it could do with a tidy up. It is opposite the \"parrot park\" and you can climb the tower to watch. Unusual modern design but nothing fantastic.",
          "This is a uniquely shaped church right off the main square. We went inside during the week and the nuns were teaching a group of children in the front of the church. It's worth a peek inside if you want to see the Catholic influence here.",
          "The key thing about this church is to visit it around 5 to 6 in the evening as the white-winged parakeet flicks are coming into the adjacent plaza to roost. They are gorgeous and noisy. The church is below average by small Colombian pueblo standards. It appears that for a fee",
          "As stated by others it\u2019s a nice view from top to enjoy the return of the parrots during the sunset. But also the interior of the church is nice. Good thing if you go up for the view you support them with 3000cop pp. Overall, it\u2019s a beautiful city which is definitely worth to be",
          "This is not overrated. Viewing the mass roosting of parrots from this bell tower is something else. We first watched the parrots one day from the ground in the park. Another day we tried it from the bell tower. Both worthy experiences, but the bell tower view is more",
          "go inside, make your donation, then go to the church tower to see the parrots and swallows at sunsent, it will cost you a dollar (1) to to on top",
          "We went to the church around 5:30 pm. For about US $1 donation you can climb to the bell tower and experience a unique experience : thousands of small noisy parrots will arrive to the park trees. The sun set and that unique gathering will create an experience that you will",
          "I recommend visiting this park around 5pm (sunset) which is when thousand and thousands of birds come everyday to sleep. Its amazing, totally worth seeing. You can go to the top of the church and see them from up there. There is a kid that charges 5,000 pesos to go up. But when",
          "The church overlooks Santander Park. In this park thousands of parakeets fly in every night to roost. From the top of the church bell tower I watched the parakeets and the sunset over the amazon river. An incredible sight! And the noise from all of those birds! It was",
          "This church is located right in front of Santander Park. After 3 or 4 pm, you can pay a couple of thousand pesos to go to the top of the church and see a great view of Leticia and the Amazon river. This is a great place to take pictures and enjoy the sounds of the birds that",
          "Pay a small amount to some small boys so you can climb the tower. The stairs are an experience in themselves, and there are lots of them. Just before sunset, clouds of parakeets fly in to settle in the park and town. It is a beautiful experience, both the amazing sight of the",
          "Every evening before dusk, all the periquit s of the area come to the park to roost. It is a unique site and one to not miss when in Leticia. While they arrive, they make a lot of noice until they find their mate. As most peeiquits, they mate for life and they all become",
          "If you show up right before sunset and give the local kids a few pesos, you can climb to the top of the church steeple and watch the most amazing arrival of thousands of parrots. They roost in Santander Park each night. I don't recommend watching this from anyplace uncovered,",
          "At around 6.30pm at sunset if you walk on the bell tower of the Catedral de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz in Leticia you can watch a unique show: thousands of small parrots heading back to Parque Santander to spend their nights on the trees there. They will fly fast like bullets and",
          "This was a nice built church, it was open when we got there so we got to see around, nice surroundings and beautiful ceiling inside!",
          "This is a nice place to stop and give thanks. You can go up on the roof-top bell tower for 3,000 CP, but it is not for children! It is a harrowing, narrow, claustraphobic experience, and you need to lift a heavy glass door on hinges to actually access the view from the roof!",
          "We went up that church tower when the sun was about to set. It was very pretty and also nice to watch over the city and see the jungle in the distance. At some point around sunset a ton of birds (really a ton!!) come down to the park next to it. It looked like hail or whatever.",
          "Normal, small church, not the greatest building but a good thing is the priest allows you to climb up to the tower to have a decent view of the park and a bit of the Amazon River. If you go up at 5 pm, you can see literally thousands of parakeets going to sleep on Parque",
          "Claim to fame is the \"best spot\" to see the birds at dusk. Thers's a kid at the base of the steps, collecting 3000 pesos for the climb to the bell towerAs no one was there on our descent, dont really know who we gave our $ to...anyway...the two story winding staircase, almost",
          "You have to experience thousands of little parakeet coming from the jungle, to sleep in the park's trees",
          "Sitting in the center of Leticia and across the street from Santander Parque, sits this simple Catedral. Not impressive on the outside, the inside is a nice surprise. Remember, you are in the middle of the Amazon. Our recent visit took us on the journey to the top of the bell",
          "Lovely church, an you can pay a small fee and go up to the top of the bell tower, which affords you great sunset views and a marvellous view of the park and the parrots coming home to roost. Worth the climb up the tight winding stairs just for the view Recommended",
          "Go to the Cathedral around 6pm and pay 2,000 pesos to climb the tower. Look out over the park and watch the millions of parakeets flying in from the Jungle to roost for the night. If you look skywards, you will also glimpse the Black Vultures trying to catch them as they arrive.",
          "Not very impressive. But go inside when there is a service and look out through the entrance door into Parque Santander during sunset. Liste to the music while the birds shreek outside. Unforgettabel."

        "wiki": "Mexico (Spanish: M\u00e9xico [\u02c8mexiko] (listen); Nahuan languages: M\u0113xihco), officially the United Mexican States (Spanish: Estados Unidos Mexicanos; EUM  [es\u02c8ta\u00f0os u\u02c8ni\u00f0oz mexi\u02c8kanos] (listen)), is a country in the southern portion of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Mexico covers 1,972,550 square kilometers (761,610 sq mi) and has approximately 128,649,565 inhabitants, making it the world's 13th-largest country by area, 10th-most populous country, and most populous Spanish-speaking nation. It is a federation comprising 31 states and Mexico City, its capital city and largest metropolis. Other major urban areas include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, and Le\u00f3n.Pre-Columbian Mexico traces its origins to 8,000 BC and is identified as one of six cradles of civilization; it was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations, most well-known among them the Maya and the Aztecs. In 1521, the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its base in Mexico City, which then became known as New Spain. The Catholic Church played an important role as millions of indigenous inhabitants converted. These populations were heavily exploited to mine rich deposits of precious material, which became a major source of wealth for the Spanish. Mexico became an independent nation state after the successful Mexican War of Independence against Spain in 1821.The War of Texas Independence in 1836 and the Mexican\u2013American War led to huge territorial losses in Mexico's sparsely populated north, contiguous to the United States. The newly instituted reforms that granted protection to indigenous communities, and curtailed the power of the military and the church, were enshrined in the Constitution of 1857. This triggered the War of the Reform and French intervention. Maximilian Habsburg was installed as emperor by France and Benito Ju\u00e1rez kept an opposing republican government in exile. The following decades were marked by instability and dictatorship of Porfirio D\u00edaz, who sought to modernize Mexico and restore order. The Porfiriato ended with the Mexican Revolution in 1910 and the winning Constitutionalist faction drafted a new 1917 Constitution. The revolutionary generals of the winning northern faction dominated the 1920s and served as presidents, but the 1928 assassination of Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n led to the formation of the Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1929, under which Mexico was a one-party state until 2000.Mexico is a developing country, ranking 76th on the Human Development Index, but is considered a newly industrialized state by several analysts. It has the world's 15th-largest economy by nominal GDP and the 11th-largest by PPP, with the United States being its largest economic partner. The large economy, area, population and politics make Mexico a regional power and a middle power, and is often identified as an emerging power. However, Mexico continues to struggle with social inequalities, poverty and extensive crime; the country ranks poorly on the Global Peace Index. Since 2006, the conflict between the government and drug trafficking syndicates lead to over 120,000 deaths.Mexico ranks first in the Americas and 7th in the world for the number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Mexico is an ecologically megadiverse country, ranking 5th in the world for its natural biodiversity. Mexico receives a significant number of tourists every year; in 2018, it was the 6th most-visited country in the world, with 39 million international arrivals. Mexico is a member of the United Nations (UN), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the G8+5, the G20, the Uniting for Consensus group of the UN, and the Pacific Alliance trade bloc.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nM\u0113xihco is the Nahuatl term for the heartland of the Aztec Empire, namely the Valley of Mexico and surrounding territories, with its people being known as the Mexica.  The terms are plainly linked; it is generally believed that the toponym for the valley was the origin of the primary ethnonym for the Aztec Triple Alliance, but it may have been the other way around. In the colonial era, when Mexico was called New Spain, this central region became the Intendency of Mexico, during the eighteenth-century reorganization of the empire, the Bourbon Reforms. After the colony achieved independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, said territory came to be known as the State of Mexico, with the new country being named after its capital: Mexico City, which itself was founded in 1524 on the site of the ancient Mexica capital of Mexico-Tenochtitlan.\nThe official name of the country has changed as the form of government has changed. The declaration of independence signed on 6 November 1813 by the deputies of the Congress of An\u00e1huac called the territory Am\u00e9rica Septentrional (Northern America) in the Plan of Iguala (1821). On two occasions (1821\u20131823 and 1863\u20131867), the country was known as Imperio Mexicano (Mexican Empire). All three federal constitutions (1824, 1857 and 1917, the current constitution) used the name Estados Unidos Mexicanos\u2014or the variant Estados-Unidos Mexicanos, all of which have been translated as \"United Mexican States\". The phrase Rep\u00fablica Mexicana, \"Mexican Republic\", was used in the 1836 Constitutional Laws.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Indigenous civilizations ===\n\nThe earliest human artifacts in Mexico are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the Valley of Mexico and radiocarbon-dated to circa 10,000 years ago. Mexico is the site of the domestication of maize, tomato, and beans, which produced an agricultural surplus. This enabled the transition from paleo-Indian hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 BC.\nIn the subsequent formative eras, maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a mythological and religious complex, and a vigesimal (base 20) numeric system, were diffused from the Mexican cultures to the rest of the Mesoamerican culture area. In this period, villages became more dense in terms of population, becoming socially stratified with an artisan class, and developing into chiefdoms. The most powerful rulers had religious and political power, organizing the construction of large ceremonial centers developed.\n\nThe earliest complex civilization in Mexico was the Olmec culture, which flourished on the Gulf Coast from around 1500 BC. Olmec cultural traits diffused through Mexico into other formative-era cultures in Chiapas, Oaxaca and the Valley of Mexico. The formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions, as well as artistic and architectural complexes. The formative-era of Mesoamerica is considered one of the six independent cradles of civilization. In the subsequent pre-classical period, the Maya and Zapotec civilizations developed complex centers at Calakmul and Monte Alb\u00e1n, respectively. During this period the first true Mesoamerican writing systems were developed in the Epi-Olmec and the Zapotec cultures. The Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic Maya Hieroglyphic script. The earliest written histories date from this era.  The tradition of writing was important after the Spanish conquest in 1521.In Central Mexico, the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of Teotihuac\u00e1n, which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the Maya area as well as north. Teotihuacan, with a population of more than 150,000 people, had some of the largest pyramidal structures in the pre-Columbian Americas. After the collapse of Teotihuac\u00e1n around 600 AD, competition ensued between several important political centers in central Mexico such as Xochicalco and Cholula. At this time, during the Epi-Classic, Nahua peoples began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of Oto-Manguean languages.\n\nDuring the early post-classic era (ca. 1000-1519 CE), Central Mexico was dominated by the Toltec culture, Oaxaca by the Mixtec, and the lowland Maya area had important centers at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Mayap\u00e1n.  Toward the end of the post-Classic period, the Mexica established dominance, establishing a political and economic empire based in the city of Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City), extending from central Mexico to the border with Guatemala. Alexander von Humboldt popularized the modern usage of \"Aztec\" as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade, custom, religion, and language to the Mexica state and \u0112xc\u0101n Tlaht\u014dl\u014dy\u0101n, the Triple Alliance. In 1843, with the publication of the work of William H. Prescott, it was adopted by most of the world, including 19th-century Mexican scholars who considered it a way to distinguish present-day Mexicans from pre-conquest Mexicans. This usage has been the subject of debate since the late 20th century.The Aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered territories; it was satisfied with the payment of tributes from them. It was a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected; for example, the southern peripheral zones of Xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center. The hegemonic nature of the Aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration of local rulers to their former position after their city-state was conquered. The Aztec did not interfere in local affairs, as long as the tributes were paid.The Aztec of Central Mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central Mexico. The Aztec were noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale. Along with this practice, they avoided killing enemies on the battlefield. Their warring casualty rate was far lower than that of their Spanish counterparts, whose principal objective was immediate slaughter during battle. This distinct Mesoamerican cultural tradition of human sacrifice ended with the gradually Spanish conquest in the 16th century. Over the next centuries many other Mexican indigenous cultures were conquered and gradually subjected to Spanish colonial rule.\n\n\n=== Conquest of the Aztec Empire (1519\u20131521) ===\n\nAlthough the Spanish had established colonies in the Caribbean starting in 1493, it was not until the second decade of the sixteenth century that they began exploring the coast of Mexico. The Spanish first learned of Mexico during the Juan de Grijalva expedition of 1518. The natives kept \"repeating: Colua, Colua, and Mexico, Mexico, but we [explorers] did not know what Colua or Mexico meant\", until encountering Montezuma's governor at the mouth of the Rio de las Banderas.  The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire began in February 1519 when Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s landed on the Gulf Coast and founded the Spanish city of Veracruz. Around 500 conquistadores, along with horses, cannons, swords, and long guns gave the Spanish some technological advantages over indigenous warriors, but key to the Spanish victory was making strategic alliances with disgruntled indigenous city-states (altepetl) who supplied the Spaniards and fought with them against the Aztec Triple Alliance.  Also important to the Spanish victory was Cort\u00e9s's cultural translator, Malinche, a Nahua woman enslaved in the Maya area whom the Spanish acquired as a gift.  She quickly learned Spanish and gave strategic advise about how to deal with both indigenous allies and indigenous foes.  The unconquered city-state of Tlaxcala allied with the Spanish against their enemies, the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan. The Spanish gained other indigenous allies, who also joined in the war for their own reasons.\nWe know so much about the conquest because it is among the best documented events in world history from multiple points of view. There are  accounts by the Spanish leader Cort\u00e9s and multiple other Spanish participants, including Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo. There are indigenous accounts in Spanish, Nahuatl, and pictorial narratives by allies of the Spanish, most prominently the Tlaxcalans, as well as Texcocans and Huejotzincans, and the defeated Mexican themselves, recorded in the last volume of Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan's General History of the Things of New Spain.\n\nWhen the Spaniards arrived, the ruler of the Aztec empire was Moctezuma II, who after a delay allowed the Spanish to proceed inland to Tenochtitlan. The Spanish captured him, holding him hostage.  He died while in their custody and the Spanish retreated from Tenochtitlan in great disarray. His successor and brother Cuitl\u00e1huac took control of the Aztec empire, but was among the first to fall from the first smallpox epidemic in the area a short time later. Unintentionally introduced by Spanish conquerors, among whom smallpox, measles, and other contagious diseases were endemic, epidemics of Old World infectious diseases ravaged Mesoamerica starting in the 1520s. The exact number of deaths is disputed, but unquestionably more than 3 million natives who they had no immunity. Other sources, however, mentioned that the death toll of the Aztecs might have reached 15 million (out of a population of less than 30 million) although such a high number conflicts with the 350,000 Aztecs who ruled an empire of 5 million or 10 million. Severely weakened, the Aztec empire was easily defeated by Cort\u00e9s and his forces on his second return with the help of state of Tlaxcala whose population estimate was 300,000. The native population declined 80\u201390% by 1600 to 1\u20132.5 million. Any population estimate of pre-Columbian Mexico is bound to be a guess but 8\u201312 million is often suggested for the area encompassed by the modern nation.\nThe territory became part of the Spanish Empire under the name of New Spain in 1535. Mexico City was systematically rebuilt by Cort\u00e9s following the Fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521. Much of the identity, traditions and architecture of Mexico developed during the 300-year colonial period from 1521 to independence in 1821.\n\n\n=== Viceroyalty of New Spain (1521\u20131821) ===\n\nThe 1521 capture Tenochtitlan and immediate founding of the Spanish capital Mexico City on its ruins was the beginning of a 300-year-long colonial era during which Mexico was known as Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain). The Kingdom of New Spain was created from the remnants of the Aztec empire. The two pillars of Spanish rule were the State and the Roman Catholic Church, both under the authority of the Spanish crown. In 1493 the pope had granted sweeping powers to the Spanish crown, with the proviso that the crown spread Christianity in its new realms. In 1524, King Charles I created the Council of the Indies based in Spain to oversee State power its overseas territories; in New Spain the crown established a high court in Mexico City, the Real Audiencia, and then in 1535 created the viceroyalty. The viceroy was highest official of the State. In the religious sphere, the diocese of Mexico was created in 1530 and elevated to the Archdiocese of Mexico in 1546, with the archbishop as the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, overseeing Roman Catholic clergy. Castilian Spanish was the language of rulers. The Catholic faith the only one permitted, with non-Catholics (Jews and Protestants) and Catholics (excluding Indians) holding unorthodox views being subject to the Mexican Inquisition, established in 1571.In the first half-century of Spanish rule, a network of Spanish cities was created, sometimes on pre-Hispanic sites. The capital Mexico City was and remains the premier city. Cities and towns were hubs of civil officials, ecclesiastics, business, Spanish elites, and mixed-race and indigenous artisans and workers. When deposits of silver were discovered in sparsely populated northern Mexico, far from the dense populations of central Mexico, the Spanish secured the region against fiercely resistant indigenous Chichimecas.  The Viceroyalty at its greatest extent included the territories of modern Mexico, Central America as far south as Costa Rica, and the western United States. The Viceregal capital Mexico City also administrated the Spanish West Indies (the Caribbean), the Spanish East Indies (that is, the Philippines), and Spanish Florida. In 1819, the Spain signed the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty with the United States, setting New Spain's northern boundary.\n\nThe population of Mexico was overwhelmingly indigenous and rural during the entire colonial period and beyond, despite the massive decrease in their numbers due to epidemic diseases. Diseases such as smallpox, measles, and others were introduced by Europeans and African slaves, especially in the sixteenth century. The indigenous population stabilized around one to one and a half million individuals in the 17th century from the most commonly accepted five to thirty million pre-contact population. During the three hundred years of the colonial era, Mexico received between 400,000 and 500,000 Europeans, between 200,000 and 250,000 African slaves. and between 40,000 and 120,000 Asians.The first census in Mexico (then known as New Spain) that included an ethnic classification was the 1793 census. Also known as the Revillagigedo census. Most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost, thus most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as German scientist Alexander von Humboldt. Europeans ranged from 18% to 22% of New Spain's population, Mestizos from 21% to 25%, Indians from 51% to 61% and Africans were between 6,000 and 10,000. The total population ranged from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354. It is concluded that the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even, while the percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%\u201317% per century mostly due the later having higher mortality rates for living in remote locations and being in constant war with the colonists. Independent-era Mexico eliminated the legal basis of the Colonial caste system which led to exclusion of racial classification in the censuses to come.\n\nColonial law with Spanish roots was introduced and attached to native customs creating a hierarchy between local jurisdiction (the Cabildos) and the Spanish Crown. Upper administrative offices were closed to native-born people, even those of pure Spanish blood (criollos). Administration was based on the racial separation. Society was organized in a racial hierarchy, with whites on top, mixed-race persons and blacks in the middle, and indigenous at the bottom. There were formal legal designations of racial categories. The Republic of Spaniards (Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles) comprised European- and American-born Spaniards, mixed-race castas, and black Africans. The Republic of Indians (Rep\u00fablica de Indios) comprised the indigenous populations, which the Spanish lumped under the term Indian (indio), a Spanish colonial social construct which indigenous groups and individuals rejected as a category. Spaniards were exempt from paying tribute, Spanish men had access to higher education, could hold civil and ecclesiastical offices, were subject to the Inquisition, and liable for military service when the standing military was established in the late eighteenth century. Indigenous paid tribute, but were exempt from the Inquisition, indigenous men were excluded from the priesthood; and exempt from military service. \nAlthough the racial system appears fixed and rigid, there was some fluidity within it, and racial domination of whites was not complete. Since the indigenous population of New Spain was so large, there was less labor demand for expensive black slaves than other parts of Spanish America.  In the late eighteenth century the crown instituted reforms that privileged Iberian-born Spaniards (peninsulares) over American-born (criollos), limiting their access to offices. This discrimination between the two became a sparking point of discontent for white elites in the colony.The Marian apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe said to have appeared to the indigenous Juan Diego in 1531 gave impetus to the evangelization of central Mexico. The Virgin of Guadalupe became a symbol for American-born Spaniards' (criollos) patriotism, seeking in her a Mexican source of pride, distinct from Spain. The Virgin of Guadalupe was invoked by the insurgents for independence who followed Father Miguel Hidalgo during the War of Independence.\n\nThe rich deposits of silver, particularly in Zacatecas and Guanajuato, resulted in silver extraction dominating the economy of New Spain. Taxes on silver production became a major source of income for Spain. Other important industries were the haciendas and mercantile activities in the main cities and ports. Wealth created during the colonial era spurred the development of New Spanish Baroque.As a result of its trade links with Asia, the rest of the Americas, Africa and Europe and the profound effect of New World silver, central Mexico was one of the first regions to be incorporated into a globalized economy. Being at the crossroads of trade, people and cultures, Mexico City has been called the \"first world city\". The Nao de China (Manila Galleons) operated for two and a half centuries and connected New Spain with Asia. Silver and the red dye cochineal were shipped from Veracruz to Atlantic ports in the Americas and Spain. Veracruz was also the main port of entry in mainland New Spain for European goods, immigrants from Spain, and African slaves. The Camino Real de Tierra Adentro connected Mexico City with the interior of New Spain. Mexican silver pesos became the first globally used currency.\n\nSpanish forces, sometimes accompanied by native allies, led expeditions to conquer territory or quell rebellions through the colonial era. Notable Amerindian revolts in sporadically populated northern New Spain include the Chichimeca War (1576\u20131606), Tepehu\u00e1n Revolt (1616\u20131620), and the Pueblo Revolt (1680), the Tzeltal Rebellion of 1712 was a regional Maya revolt.  Most rebellions were small-scale and local, posing no major threat to the ruling elites.  To protect Mexico from the attacks of English, French, and Dutch pirates and protect the Crown's monopoly of revenue, only two ports were open to foreign trade\u2014Veracruz on the Atlantic and Acapulco on the Pacific. Among the best-known pirate attacks are the 1663 Sack of Campeche and 1683 Attack on Veracruz.  Of greater concern to the crown was of foreign invasion, especially after Britain seized in 1762 the Spanish ports of Havana, Cuba and Manila, the Philippines in the Seven Years' War. It created a standing military, increased coastal fortifications, and expanded the northern presidios and missions into Alta California. The volatility of the urban poor in Mexico City was evident in the 1692 riot in the Z\u00f3calo. The riot over the price of maize escalated to a full-scale attack on the seats of power, with the viceregal palace and the archbishop's residence attacked by the mob.Due to the importance of New Spain administrative base, Mexico was the location of the first printing shop (1539), first university (1551), first public park (1592), and first public library (1640) in the Americas, among other institutions. Important artists of the colonial period, include the writers Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n, Carlos de Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora, and Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, painters Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando and Miguel Cabrera, and architect Manuel Tols\u00e1. The Academy of San Carlos (1781) was the first major school and museum of art in the Americas.  German scientist Alexander von Humboldt spent a year in Mexico, finding the scientific community in the capital active and learned.  He met Mexican scientist Andr\u00e9s Manuel del R\u00edo Fern\u00e1ndez, who discovered the element vanadium in 1801.\nMany Mexican cultural features including tequila, first distilled in the 16th century, charreria (17th), mariachi (18th) and Mexican cuisine, a fusion of American and European (particularly Spanish) cuisine, arose during the colonial era.\n\n\n=== War of Independence (1810\u20131821) ===\n\nOn 16 September 1810, a \"loyalist revolt\" against the ruling junta was declared by priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, in the small town of Dolores, Guanajuato. This event, known as the Cry of Dolores (Spanish: Grito de Dolores) is commemorated each year, on 16 September, as Mexico's independence day. The first insurgent group was formed by Hidalgo, the Spanish viceregal army captain Ignacio Allende, the militia captain Juan Aldama and La Corregidora (English: \"The Magistrate\") Josefa Ortiz de Dom\u00ednguez. Hidalgo and some of his soldiers were captured and executed by firing squad in Chihuahua, on 31 July 1811.Following Hidalgo's death, the leadership was assumed by Ignacio L\u00f3pez Ray\u00f3n and then by the priest Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos, who occupied key southern cities with the support of Mariano Matamoros and Nicol\u00e1s Bravo. In one notable incident, Nicolas Bravo captured 200 royalist soldiers, whom Morelos ordered should be executed in revenge of the murder of Bravo's father. In an act of mercy, Bravo instead pardoned the prisoners, most of whom then joined the insurgent cause. In 1813 the Congress of Chilpancingo was convened and, on 6 November, signed the \"Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America\". This Act also abolished slavery and the caste system. Morelos was captured and executed on 22 December 1815.\n\nIn subsequent years, the insurgency was near collapse, but in 1820 Viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca sent an army under the criollo general Agust\u00edn de Iturbide against the troops of Vicente Guerrero who had among his trusted soldiers, Filipino Mexicans who were concentrated in Guerrero, a state later named after Vicente Guerrero himself and where the Mexican flag was first sewn. Chief among the Filipino-Mexican soldiers was General Isidoro Montes de Oca who defeated Royalist armies 3 times his force's size. Then, the Criollo Royalist, Agustin Iturbide, instead of attacking Vicente Guerrero, approached Guerrero to join forces as he was impressed with his tenacity despite fighting larger odds, and on 24 August 1821 representatives of the Spanish Crown and Iturbide signed the \"Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba\" and the \"Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire\", which recognized the independence of Mexico under the terms of the \"Plan of Iguala\".Mexico's short recovery after the War of Independence was soon cut short again by the civil wars, foreign invasion and occupation, and institutional instability of the mid-19th century, which lasted until the government of Porfirio D\u00edaz reestablished conditions that paved the way for economic growth. The conflicts that arose from the mid-1850s had a profound effect because they were widespread and made themselves perceptible in the vast rural areas of the countries, involved clashes between castes, different ethnic groups, and haciendas, and entailed a deepening of the political and ideological divisions between republicans and monarchists.\n\n\n=== Mexican Empire and the Early Republic (1821\u20131855) ===\n\nThe first thirty-five years after Mexico's independence were marked by political instability and the changing form of the Mexican State, from a monarchy to a federated republic.  There were military coups d'\u00e9tat, foreign invasions, ideological conflict between Conservatives and Liberals, and economic stagnation. Catholicism remained the only permitted religious faith and the Catholic Church as an institution retained its special privileges, prestige, and property, a bulwark of Conservatism. The army, another Conservative institution, also retained its privileges. Former Royal Army General Agust\u00edn de Iturbide, became regent, as newly independent Mexico sought a constitutional monarch from Europe.  When no member of a European royal house desired the position, Iturbide himself was declared Emperor Agust\u00edn I. The young and weak United States was the first country to recognize Mexico's independence, sending an ambassador to the court of the emperor and sending a message to Europe via the Monroe Doctrine not to intervene in Mexico.  The emperor's rule was short (1822\u201323) and he was overthrown by army officers.The successful rebels established the First Mexican Republic. In 1824, a constitution of a federated republic was promulgated and former insurgent general Guadalupe Victoria became the first president of the newly born republic. Central America, including Chiapas, left the union. In 1829, former insurgent general and fierce Liberal Vicente Guerrero, a signatory of the Plan de Iguala that achieved independence, became president in a disputed election. During his short term in office, April to December 1829, he abolished slavery. As a visibly mixed-race man of modest origins, Guerrero was seen by white political elites as an interloper. His Conservative vice president, former Royalist General Anastasio Bustamante, led a coup against him and Guerrero was judicially murdered.  There was constant strife between Liberals, supporters of a federal form of decentralized government and often called Federalists and their political rivals, the Conservatives, who proposed a hierarchical form of government, were termed Centralists.\n\nMexico's ability to maintain its independence and establish a viable government was in question.  Spain attempted to reconquer its former colony during the 1820s, but eventually recognized its independence.   France attempted to recoup losses it claimed for its citizens during Mexico's unrest and blockaded the Gulf Coast during the so-called Pastry War of 1838\u201339. Santa Anna lost a leg in combat during this conflict, which he used for political purposes. Emerging as a national hero in defending Mexico was creole army general, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, who had participated in the overthrow of the emperor, fought the Spanish invasion, and came to dominate the politics for the next 25 years, until his own overthrow in 1855.\nMexico also contended with indigenous groups which controlled territory that Mexico claimed in the north.  The Comanche controlled a huge territory in the sparsely populated region of central and northern Texas. Wanting to stabilize and develop the frontier, the Mexican government encouraged Anglo-American immigration into present-day Texas. The region bordered the United States, and was territory controlled by Comanches. There were few settlers from central Mexico moving to this remote and hostile territory. Mexico by law was a Catholic country; the Anglo Americans were primarily Protestant English speakers from the southern United States. Some brought their black slaves, which after 1829 was contrary to Mexican law. Santa Anna sought to centralize government rule, suspending the constitution and promulgating the Seven Laws, which place power in his hands. When he suspended the 1824 Constitution, civil war spread across the country. Three new governments declared independence: the Republic of Texas, the Republic of the Rio Grande and the Republic of Yucat\u00e1n.The largest blow to Mexico was the U.S. invasion of Mexico in 1846 in the Mexican American War. Mexico lost much of its sparsely populated northern territory, sealed in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.  Despite that disastrous loss, Conservative Santa Anna returned to the presidency yet again and then was ousted and exiled in the Liberal Revolution of Ayutla.\n\n\n=== Liberal Reform, French Intervention, and Restored Republic (1855\u20131876) ===\n\nThe overthrow of Santa Anna and the establishment of a civilian government by Liberals allowed them to enact laws that they considered vital for Mexico's economic development. It was a prelude to more civil wars and yet another foreign invasion. The Liberal Reform attempted to modernize Mexico's economy and institutions along liberal principles. They promulgated a new Constitution of 1857, separating Church and State, stripping the Conservative institutions of the Church and the military of their special privileges (fueros); mandating the sale of Church-owned property and sale of indigenous community lands, and secularizing education. Conservatives revolted, touching off civil war between rival Liberal and Conservative governments (1858\u201361). \nThe Liberals defeated the Conservative army on the battlefield, but Conservatives sought another solution to gain power via foreign intervention by the French. Mexican conservatives asked Emperor Napoleon III to place a European monarch as head of state in Mexico. The French Army defeated the Mexican Army and placed Maximilian Hapsburg on the newly-established throne of Mexico, supported by Mexican Conservatives and propped up by the French Army. The Liberal republic under Benito Ju\u00e1rez was basically a government in internal exile, but with the end of the Civil War in the U.S. in April 1865, that government began aiding the Mexican Republic. Two years later, the French Army withdrew its support, Maximilian remained in Mexico rather than return to Europe. Republican forces captured him and he was executed in Quer\u00e9taro, along with two Conservative Mexican generals.  The \"Restored Republic\" saw the return of Ju\u00e1rez, who was \"the personification of the embattled republic,\" as president.\nThe Conservatives had been not only defeated militarily, but also discredited politically for their collaboration with the French invaders. Liberalism became synonymous with patriotism.  The Mexican Army that had its roots in the colonial royal army and then the army of the early republic was destroyed. New military leaders had emerged from the War of the Reform and the conflict with the French, most notably Porfirio D\u00edaz, a hero of the Cinco de Mayo, who now sought civilian power. Ju\u00e1rez won re-election in 1867, but was challenged by D\u00edaz, who criticized him for running for re-election. D\u00edaz then rebelled, crushed by Ju\u00e1rez.  Having won re-election, Ju\u00e1rez died in office of natural causes in July 1872, and Liberal Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada became president, declaring a \"religion of state\" for rule of law, peace, and order. When Lerdo ran for re-election, D\u00edaz rebelled against the civilian president, issuing the Plan of Tuxtepec. D\u00edaz had more support and waged guerrilla warfare against Lerdo.  On the verge of D\u00edaz's victory on the battlefield, Lerdo fled from office, going into exile. Another army general assumed the presidency of Mexico.\n\n\n=== Porfiriato (1876\u20131911) ===\n\nAfter the turmoil in Mexico from 1810 to 1876, the 35-year rule of Liberal General Porfirio D\u00edaz (r.1876-1911) allowed Mexico to rapidly modernize in a period characterized as one of \"order and progress\". The Porfiriato was characterized by economic stability and growth, significant foreign investment and influence, an expansion of the railroad network and telecommunications, and investments in the arts and sciences. The period was also marked by economic inequality and political repression. D\u00edaz knew the potential for army rebellions, and systematically downsized the expenditure for the force, rather expanding the rural police force under direct control of the president. \nThe government encouraged British and U.S. investment. Commercial agriculture developed in northern Mexico, with many investors from the U.S. acquiring vast ranching estates and expanding irrigated cultivation of crops. The Mexican government ordered a survey of land with the aim of selling it for development. In this period, many indigenous communities lost their lands and the men became landless wage earners on large landed enterprises (haciendas). British and U.S. investors developed extractive mining of copper, lead, and other minerals, as well as petroleum on the Gulf Coast. Changes in Mexican law allowed for private enterprises to own the subsoil rights of land, rather than continuing the colonial law that gave all subsoil rights to the State.  An industrial manufacturing sector also developed, particularly in textiles.  At the same time, new enterprises gave rise to an industrial work force, which began organizing to gain labor rights and protections.\nD\u00edaz ruled with a group of advisors that became known as the cient\u00edficos (\"scientists\"). The most influential cientifco was Secretary of Finance Jos\u00e9 Yves Limantour. The Porfirian regime was influenced by positivism. They rejected theology and idealism in favor of scientific methods being applied towards national development. As an integral aspect of the liberal project was secular education.\nD\u00edaz's long success did not include planning for a political transition beyond his own presidency. He made no attempt, however, to establish a family dynasty, naming no relative as his successor.  As the centennial of independence approached, D\u00edaz gave an interview where he said he was not going to run in the 1910 elections, when he would be 80. Political opposition had been suppressed and there were few avenues for a new generation of leaders. But his announcement set off a frenzy of political activity, including the unlikely candidacy of the scion of a rich landowning family, Francisco I. Madero. Madero won a surprising amount of political support when D\u00edaz changed his mind an ran in the election, jailing Madero. The September centennial celebration of independence was the last celebration of the Porfiriato. The Mexican Revolution starting in 1910 saw a decade of civil war, the \"wind that swept Mexico.\"\n\n\n=== Mexican Revolution (1910\u20131920) ===\n\nThe Mexican Revolution was a decade-long transformational conflict in Mexico, with consequences to this day. It saw uprisings against President D\u00edaz, his resignation, an interim presidency, and the democratic election of a rich landowner, Francisco I. Madero in 1911. In February 1913, a military coup d'\u00e9tat overthrew Madero's government, with the support of the U.S., resulted in Madero's murder by agents of Federal Army General Victoriano Huerta. A coalition of anti-Huerta forces in the North, the Constitutionalist Army overseen by Venustiano Carranza, and a peasant army in the South under Emiliano Zapata, defeated the Federal Army. In 1914 that army was dissolved as an institution. Following the revolutionaries' victory against Huerta, revolutionary armies sought to broker a peaceful political solution, but the coalition splintered, plunging Mexico into civil war again. Constitutionalist general Pancho Villa, commander of the Division of the North, broke with Carranza and allied with Zapata. Carranza's best general, Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n, defeated Villa, his former comrade-in-arms in the battle of Celaya in 1915, and Villa's forces melted away. Carranza became the de facto head of Mexico, and the U.S. recognized his government. In 1916, the winners met at a constitutional convention to draft the Constitution of 1917, which was ratified in February 1917. With amendments, it remains the governing document of Mexico. It is estimated that the war killed 900,000 of the 1910 population of 15 million.The U.S. has had a history of inference and intervention in Mexico, most notably the Mexican-American War. During the Revolution, the Taft administration supported the Huerta coup against Madero, but when Woodrow Wilson was inaugurated as president in March 1913, it refused to recognize Huerta's regime and allowed arms sales to the Constitutionalists. Wilson ordered troops to occupy the strategic port of Veracruz in 1914, which was lifted. After Pancho Villa was defeated by revolutionary forces in 1915, he led a raid into Columbus, New Mexico incursion, prompting the U.S. to send 10,000 troops led by General John J. Pershing in an unsuccessful attempt to capture Villa.  Carranza pushed back against U.S. troops being in northern Mexico. The expeditionary forces withdrew as the U.S. entered World War I.  Germany attempted to get Mexico to side with it, sending a coded telegram in 1917 to incite war between the U.S. and Mexico, with Mexico to regain the territory it lost in the Mexican-American War. Mexico remained neutral in the conflict.\nConsolidating power, President Carranza had peasant-leader Emiliano Zapata assassinated in 1919.  Carranza had gained support of the peasantry during the Revolution, but once in power he did little to distribute land, and, in fact, returned some confiscated land to their original owners. President Carranza's best general, Obreg\u00f3n, served briefly in Carranza's administration, but returned to his home state of Sonora to position himself to run in the 1920 presidential election. Carranza chose a political and revolutionary no-body to succeed him.  Obreg\u00f3n and two other Sonoran revolutionary generals drew up the Plan of Agua Prieta, overthrowing Carranza, who died fleeing Mexico City in 1920. General Adolfo de la Huerta became interim president, followed the election of General \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n.\n\n\n=== Political consolidation and one-party rule (1920\u20132000) ===\n\nThe first quarter-century of the post-revolutionary period (1920-1946) was characterized by revolutionary generals serving as Presidents of Mexico.  In consolidating power, victorious eorthern revolutionary generals systematically worked to tame the military and bring it under civilian n control. Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n (1920\u201324); Plutarco El\u00edas Calles (1924-28; and behind the scenes power until 1935); L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas (1934\u201340); and Manuel Avila Camacho (1940\u201346) succeeded in that endeavor, such that the modern Mexican military is under civilian rule and since 1946 no member of the military has been president of Mexico. The post-revolutionary project of the Mexican government sought to bring order to the country, end military intervention in politics, and create organizations of interest groups. Workers, peasants, urban office workers, and even the army for a short period were incorporated as sectors of the single party that dominated Mexican politics from its founding in 1929. \nObreg\u00f3n instigated land reform and strengthened the power of organized labor. He gained recognition from the United States and took steps to settle claims with companies and individuals that lost property during the Revolution. He imposed his fellow former Sonoran revolutionary general, Calles, as his successor, prompting an unsuccessful military revolt. As president Calles provoked a major conflict with the Catholic Church and Catholic guerrilla armies when he strictly enforced anticlerical articles of the 1917 Constitution. The Church-State conflict was mediated and ended with the aid of the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico. Although the constitution prohibited reelection of the president, Obreg\u00f3n wished to run again and the constitution was amended to allow non-consecutive re-election.  Obreg\u00f3n won the 1928 elections, but was assassinated by a Catholic zealot, causing a political crisis of succession. Calles could not become president again, since he has just ended his term.  He sought to set up a structure to manage presidential succession, founding the party that was to dominate Mexico until the late twentieth century. Calles declared that the Revolution had moved from caudillismo (rule by strongmen) to the era institucional (institutional era).\n\nDespite not holding the presidency, Calles remained the key political figure during the period known as the Maximato (1929-1934). The Maximato ended during the presidency of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, who expelled Calles from the country and implemented many economic and social reforms. This included the Mexican oil expropriation in March 1938, which nationalized the U.S. and Anglo-Dutch oil company known as the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company. This movement would result in the creation of the state-owned Mexican oil company Pemex. This sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries whose citizens had lost businesses by C\u00e1rdenas's radical measure, but since then the company has played an important role in the economic development of Mexico. C\u00e1rdenas's successor, Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho (1940-1946) was more moderate, and relations between the U.S. and Mexico vastly improved during World War II, when Mexico was a significant ally, providing manpower and materiel to aid the war effort.\nFrom 1946 the election of Miguel Alem\u00e1n, the first civilian president in the post-revolutionary period, Mexico embarked on an aggressive program of economic development, known as the Mexican miracle, which was characterized by industrialization, urbanization, and the increase of inequality in Mexico between urban and rural areas.  With robust economic growth, Mexico sought to showcase it to the world by hosting the 1968 Summer Olympics. The government poured huge resources into building new facilities. At the same time, there was political unrest by university students and others with those expenditures, while their own circumstances were difficult. Demonstrations in central Mexico City went on for weeks before the planned opening of the games, with the government of Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz cracking down. The culmination was the Tlatelolco Massacre, which claimed the lives of around 300 protesters based on conservative estimates and perhaps as many as 800.\n\nAlthough the economy continued to flourish for some, social inequality remained a factor of discontent. PRI rule became increasingly authoritarian and at times oppressive in what is now referred to as the Mexican Dirty WarLuis Echeverr\u00eda, Minister of the Interior under D\u00edaz Ordaz, carrying out the repression during the Olympics, was elected president in 1970. His government had to contend with mistrust of Mexicans and increasing economic problems. He instituted some with electoral reforms. Echeverr\u00eda chose Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo as his successor in 1976. Economic problems worsened in his early term, then massive reserves of petroleum were located off Mexico's Gulf Coast. Pemex did not have the capacity to develop these reserves itself, and brought in foreign firms.  Oil prices had been high because of OPEC's lock on oil production, and L\u00f3pez Portilla borrowed money from foreign banks for current spending to fund social programs.  Those foreign banks were happy to lend to Mexico because the oil reserves were enormous and future revenues were collateral for loans denominated in U.S. dollars.  When the price of oil dropped, Mexico's economy collapsed in the 1982 Crisis. Interest rates soared, the peso devalued, and unable to pay loans, the government defaulted on its debt. President Miguel de la Madrid (1982\u201388) resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked inflation.\nIn the 1980s the first cracks emerged in the PRI's complete political dominance. In Baja California, the PAN candidate was elected as governor. When De la Madrid chose Carlos Salinas de Gortari as the candidate for the PRI, and therefore a foregone presidential victor, Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas, son of former President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, broke with the PRI and challenged Salinas in the 1988 elections. In 1988 there was massive electoral fraud, with results showing that Salinas had won the election by the narrowest percentage ever.  There were massive protests in Mexico City to the stolen election. Salinas took the oath of office on 1 December 1988. In 1990 the PRI was famously described by Mario Vargas Llosa as the \"perfect dictatorship\", but by then there had been major challenges to the PRI's hegemony.\n\nAlthough Salinas won by fraud, he embarked on a program of neoliberal reforms which fixed the exchange rate of the peso, controlled inflation, opened Mexico to foreign investment, and began talked with the U.S. and Canada to join their free-trade agreement. In order to do that, the Constitution of 1917 was amended in several important ways. Article 27, which allowed the government to expropriate natural resources and distribute land, was amended to end agrarian reform and to guarantee private owners' property rights.  The anti-clerical articles that muzzled religious institutions, especially the Catholic Church, were amended. Signing on to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) removed Mexico's autonomy over trade policy. The agreement came into effect on 1 January 1994; the same day, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) started a two-week-long armed rebellion against the federal government, and has continued as a non-violent opposition movement against neoliberalism and globalization.\nIn 1994, following the assassination of the PRI's presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, Salinas was succeeded by substitute PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo. Salinas left Zedillo's government to deal with the Mexican peso crisis, requiring a $50 billion IMF bailout. Major macroeconomic reforms were started by President Zedillo, and the economy rapidly recovered and growth peaked at almost 7% by the end of 1999.\n\n\n=== Contemporary Mexico ===\n\nIn 2000, after 71 years, the PRI lost a presidential election to Vicente Fox of the opposition National Action Party (PAN). In the 2006 presidential election, Felipe Calder\u00f3n from the PAN was declared the winner, with a very narrow margin (0.58%) over leftist politician Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador then the candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). L\u00f3pez Obrador, however, contested the election and pledged to create an \"alternative government\".After twelve years, in 2012, the PRI won the presidency again with the election of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the governor of the State of Mexico from 2005 to 2011. However, he won with a plurality of about 38%, and did not have a legislative majority.\n\nAfter founding the new political party MORENA, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador won the 2018 presidential election with over 50% of the vote. His political coalition, led by his left-wing party, founded after the 2012 elections includes parties and politicians from all over the political spectrum. The coalition also won a majority in both the upper and lower congress chambers. AMLO's (one of his many nicknames) success is attributed to the country's other strong political alternatives exhausting their chances as well as the politician adopting a moderate discourse with focus in conciliation.Mexico has contended with high crime rates, official corruption, narcotrafficking, and a stagnant economy. Many state-owned industrial enterprises were privatized starting in the 1990s, with neoliberal reforms, but Pemex, the state-owned petroleum company is only slowly being privatized, with exploration licenses being issued. In AMLO's push against government corruption, the ex-CEO of Pemex has been arrested.Although there were fears of electoral fraud in Mexico's 2018 presidential elections, the results gave a mandate to AMLO.  Mexico's literacy rate is high, at 94.86% in 2018, up from 82.99% in 1980, with the literacy rates of males and females being relatively equal.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, as of mid-March, the country had a few cases, but as of mid-July, there were over 320,000 cases reported.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMexico is located between latitudes 14\u00b0 and 33\u00b0N, and longitudes 86\u00b0 and 119\u00b0W in the southern portion of North America. Almost all of Mexico lies in the North American Plate, with small parts of the Baja California peninsula on the Pacific and Cocos Plates. Geophysically, some geographers include the territory east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (around 12% of the total) within Central America. Geopolitically, however, Mexico is entirely considered part of North America, along with Canada and the United States.Mexico's total area is 1,972,550 km2 (761,606 sq mi), making it the world's 13th largest country by total area. It has coastlines on the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of California, as well as the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, the latter two forming part of the Atlantic Ocean. Within these seas are about 6,000 km2 (2,317 sq mi) of islands (including the remote Pacific Guadalupe Island and the Revillagigedo Islands). From its farthest land points, Mexico is a little over 2,000 mi (3,219 km) in length.\nOn its north, Mexico shares a 3,141 km (1,952 mi) border with the United States. The meandering R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (known as the Rio Grande in the United States) defines the border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez east to the Gulf of Mexico. A series of natural and artificial markers delineate the United States-Mexican border west from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the Pacific Ocean. Donald Trump made the construction of a border wall (on the U.S. side) an element of his 2016 presidential campaign. On its south, Mexico shares an 871 km (541 mi) border with Guatemala and a 251 km (156 mi) border with Belize.\nMexico is crossed from north to south by two mountain ranges known as Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental, which are the extension of the Rocky Mountains from northern North America. From east to west at the center, the country is crossed by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt also known as the Sierra Nevada. A fourth mountain range, the Sierra Madre del Sur, runs from Michoac\u00e1n to Oaxaca.As such, the majority of the Mexican central and northern territories are located at high altitudes, and the highest elevations are found at the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt: Pico de Orizaba (5,700 m or 18,701 ft), Popocat\u00e9petl (5,462 m or 17,920 ft) and Iztaccihuatl (5,286 m or 17,343 ft) and the Nevado de Toluca (4,577 m or 15,016 ft). Three major urban agglomerations are located in the valleys between these four elevations: Toluca, Greater Mexico City and Puebla.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe Tropic of Cancer effectively divides the country into temperate and tropical zones. Land north of the Tropic of Cancer experiences cooler temperatures during the winter months. South of the Tropic of Cancer, temperatures are fairly constant year round and vary solely as a function of elevation. This gives Mexico one of the world's most diverse weather systems.\nAreas south of the Tropic of Cancer with elevations up to 1,000 m (3,281 ft) (the southern parts of both coastal plains as well as the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula), have a yearly median temperature between 24 to 28 \u00b0C (75.2 to 82.4 \u00b0F). Temperatures here remain high throughout the year, with only a 5 \u00b0C (9 \u00b0F) difference between winter and summer median temperatures. Both Mexican coasts, except for the south coast of the Bay of Campeche and northern Baja, are also vulnerable to serious hurricanes during the summer and fall. Although low-lying areas north of the Tropic of Cancer are hot and humid during the summer, they generally have lower yearly temperature averages (from 20 to 24 \u00b0C or 68.0 to 75.2 \u00b0F) because of more moderate conditions during the winter.\nMany large cities in Mexico are located in the Valley of Mexico or in adjacent valleys with altitudes generally above 2,000 m (6,562 ft). This gives them a year-round temperate climate with yearly temperature averages (from 16 to 18 \u00b0C or 60.8 to 64.4 \u00b0F) and cool nighttime temperatures throughout the year.\nMany parts of Mexico, particularly the north, have a dry climate with sporadic rainfall while parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than 2,000 mm (78.7 in) of annual precipitation. For example, many cities in the north like Monterrey, Hermosillo, and Mexicali experience temperatures of 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) or more in summer. In the Sonoran Desert temperatures reach 50 \u00b0C (122 \u00b0F) or more.\n\n\n==== Climate change ====\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n\nMexico ranks fourth in the world in biodiversity and is one of the 17 megadiverse countries. With over 200,000 different species, Mexico is home of 10\u201312% of the world's biodiversity. Mexico ranks first in biodiversity in reptiles with 707 known species, second in mammals with 438 species, fourth in amphibians with 290 species, and fourth in flora, with 26,000 different species. Mexico is also considered the second country in the world in ecosystems and fourth in overall species. About 2,500 species are protected by Mexican legislations.In 2002, Mexico had the second fastest rate of deforestation in the world, second only to Brazil. The government has taken another initiative in the late 1990s to broaden the people's knowledge, interest and use of the country's esteemed biodiversity, through the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad.\nIn Mexico, 170,000 square kilometres (65,637 sq mi) are considered \"Protected Natural Areas\". These include 34 biosphere reserves (unaltered ecosystems), 67 national parks, 4 natural monuments (protected in perpetuity for their aesthetic, scientific or historical value), 26 areas of protected flora and fauna, 4 areas for natural resource protection (conservation of soil, hydrological basins and forests) and 17 sanctuaries (zones rich in diverse species).The discovery of the Americas brought to the rest of the world many widely used food crops and edible plants. Some of Mexico's native culinary ingredients include: chocolate, avocado, tomato, maize, vanilla, guava, chayote, epazote, camote, j\u00edcama, nopal, zucchini, tejocote, huitlacoche, sapote, mamey sapote, many varieties of beans, and an even greater variety of chiles, such as the habanero and the jalape\u00f1o. Most of these names come from indigenous languages like Nahuatl.\nBecause of its high biodiversity Mexico has also been a frequent site of bioprospecting by international research bodies. The first highly successful instance being the discovery in 1947 of the tuber \"Barbasco\" (Dioscorea composita) which has a high content of diosgenin, revolutionizing the production of synthetic hormones in the 1950s and 1960s and eventually leading to the invention of combined oral contraceptive pills.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nThe United Mexican States are a federation whose government is representative, democratic and republican based on a presidential system according to the 1917 Constitution. The constitution establishes three levels of government: the federal Union, the state governments and the municipal governments. According to the constitution, all constituent states of the federation must have a republican form of government composed of three branches: the executive, represented by a governor and an appointed cabinet, the legislative branch constituted by a unicameral congress and the judiciary, which will include a state Supreme Court of Justice. They also have their own civil and judicial codes.\nThe federal legislature is the bicameral Congress of the Union, composed of the Senate of the Republic and the Chamber of Deputies. The Congress makes federal law, declares war, imposes taxes, approves the national budget and international treaties, and ratifies diplomatic appointments.The federal Congress, as well as the state legislatures, are elected by a system of parallel voting that includes plurality and proportional representation. The Chamber of Deputies has 500 deputies. Of these, 300 are elected by plurality vote in single-member districts (the federal electoral districts) and 200 are elected by proportional representation with closed party lists for which the country is divided into five electoral constituencies. The Senate is made up of 128 senators. Of these, 64 senators (two for each state and two for Mexico City) are elected by plurality vote in pairs; 32 senators are the first minority or first-runner up (one for each state and one for Mexico City), and 32 are elected by proportional representation from national closed party lists.The executive is the President of the United Mexican States, who is the head of state and government, as well as the commander-in-chief of the Mexican military forces. The President also appoints the Cabinet and other officers. The President is responsible for executing and enforcing the law, and has the power to veto bills.\n\nThe highest organ of the judicial branch of government is the Supreme Court of Justice, the national supreme court, which has eleven judges appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. The Supreme Court of Justice interprets laws and judges cases of federal competency. Other institutions of the judiciary are the Federal Electoral Tribunal, collegiate, unitary and district tribunals, and the Council of the Federal Judiciary.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\n\nThree parties have historically been the dominant parties in Mexican politics: the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), a center-left party and member of Socialist International that was founded in 1929 to unite all the factions of the Mexican Revolution and held an almost hegemonic power in Mexican politics since then; the National Action Party (PAN), a conservative party founded in 1939 and belonging to the Christian Democrat Organization of America; and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) a left-wing party, founded in 1989 as the successor of the coalition of socialists and liberal parties. PRD emerged after what has now been proven was a stolen election in 1988, and has won numerous state and local elections since then. PAN won its first governorship in 1989, and won the presidency in 2000 and 2006.A new political party, National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), a leftist-populist party, emerged after the 2012 election and dominated the 2018 Mexican general election.Unlike many Latin American countries, the military in Mexico does not participate in politics and is under civilian control.\n\n\n=== Law enforcement ===\n\nPublic security is enacted at the three levels of government, each of which has different prerogatives and responsibilities. Local and state police departments are primarily in charge of law enforcement, whereas the Mexican Federal Police are in charge of specialized duties. All levels report to the Secretar\u00eda de Seguridad P\u00fablica (Secretary of Public Security). The General Attorney's Office (Fiscal\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica, FGR) is a constitutional autonomous organism in charge of investigating and prosecuting crimes at the federal level, mainly those related to drug and arms trafficking, espionage, and bank robberies. The FGR operates the Federal Ministerial Police (Policia Federal Ministerial, PMF) an investigative and preventive agency.While the government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, serious abuses of power have been reported in security operations in the southern part of the country and in indigenous communities and poor urban neighborhoods. The National Human Rights Commission has had little impact in reversing this trend, engaging mostly in documentation but failing to use its powers to issue public condemnations to the officials who ignore its recommendations. By law, all defendants have the rights that assure them fair trials and humane treatment; however, the system is overburdened and overwhelmed with several problems.Despite the efforts of the authorities to fight crime and fraud, most Mexicans have low confidence in the police or the judicial system, and therefore, few crimes are actually reported by the citizens. The Global Integrity Index which measures the existence and effectiveness of national anti-corruption mechanisms rated Mexico 31st behind Kenya, Thailand, and Russia. In 2008, president Calder\u00f3n proposed a major reform of the judicial system, which was approved by the Congress of the Union, which included oral trials, the presumption of innocence for defendants, the authority of local police to investigate crime\u2014until then a prerogative of special police units\u2014and several other changes intended to speed up trials.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nDrug cartels are a major concern in Mexico. Mexico's drug war, ongoing since 2006, has left over 120,000 dead and perhaps another 37,000 missing. The Mexican drug cartels have as many as 100,000 members. Mexico's National Geography and Statistics Institute estimated that in 2014, one-fifth of Mexicans were victims of some sort of crime. The U.S. Department of State warns its citizens to exercise increased caution when traveling in Mexico, issuing travel advisories on its website.\n\nPresident Felipe Calder\u00f3n (2006\u201312) made eradicating organized crime one of the top priorities of his administration by deploying military personnel to cities where drug cartels operate. This move was criticized by the opposition parties and the National Human Rights Commission for escalating the violence, but its effects have been positively evaluated by the US State Department's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs as having obtained \"unprecedented results\" with \"many important successes\".Since President Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched a crackdown against cartels in 2006, more than 28,000 alleged criminals have been successfully killed. Of the total drug-related violence 4% are innocent people, mostly by-passers and people trapped in between shootings; 90% accounts for criminals and 6% for military personnel and police officers. In October 2007, President Calder\u00f3n and US president George W. Bush announced the M\u00e9rida Initiative, a plan of law enforcement cooperation between the two countries.More than 100 journalists and media workers have been killed or disappeared since 2000, and most of these crimes remained unsolved, improperly investigated, and with few perpetrators arrested and convicted.The mass kidnapping of the 43 students in Iguala on 26 September 2014 triggered nationwide protests against the government's weak response to the disappearances and widespread corruption that gives free rein to criminal organizations.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nThe foreign relations of Mexico are directed by the President of Mexico and managed through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The principles of the foreign policy are constitutionally recognized in the Article 89, Section 10, which include: respect for international law and legal equality of states, their sovereignty and independence, trend to non-interventionism in the domestic affairs of other countries, peaceful resolution of conflicts, and promotion of collective security through active participation in international organizations. Since the 1930s, the Estrada Doctrine has served as a crucial complement to these principles.Mexico is founding member of several international organizations, most notably the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the OPANAL and the Rio Group. In 2008, Mexico contributed over 40 million dollars to the United Nations regular budget. In addition, it was the only Latin American member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development since it joined in 1994 until Chile gained full membership in 2010.Mexico is considered a regional power hence its presence in major economic groups such as the G8+5 and the G-20. In addition, since the 1990s Mexico has sought a reform of the United Nations Security Council and its working methods with the support of Canada, Italy, Pakistan and other nine countries, which form a group informally called the Coffee Club.After the War of Independence, the relations of Mexico were focused primarily on the United States, its northern neighbor, largest trading partner, and the most powerful actor in hemispheric and world affairs. Mexico supported the Cuban government since its establishment in the early 1960s, the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua during the late 1970s, and leftist revolutionary groups in El Salvador during the 1980s. Felipe Calder\u00f3n's administration (2006-2012) put a greater emphasis on relations with Latin America and the Caribbean. Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto (2012-2018) emphasized economic issues and foreign investment, particularly the now-defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has taken a cautious approach, unwilling to challenge U.S. President Donald Trump on either trade or migration, while maintaining neutrality on Venezuela and welcoming Chinese money.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nThe Mexican military \"provides a unique example of a military leadership's transforming itself into a civilian political elite, simultaneously transferring the basis of power from the army to a civilian state.\"  The transformation was brought about by revolutionary generals in the 1920s and 1930s, following the demise of the Federal Army following its complete defeat during the decade-long Mexican Revolution.The Mexican Armed Forces have two branches: the Mexican Army (which includes the Mexican Air Force), and the Mexican Navy. The Mexican Armed Forces maintain significant infrastructure, including facilities for design, research, and testing of weapons, vehicles, aircraft, naval vessels, defense systems and electronics; military industry manufacturing centers for building such systems, and advanced naval dockyards that build heavy military vessels and advanced missile technologies.\n\nIn recent years, Mexico has improved its training techniques, military command and information structures and has taken steps to becoming more self-reliant in supplying its military by designing as well as manufacturing its own arms, missiles, aircraft, vehicles, heavy weaponry, electronics, defense systems, armor, heavy military industrial equipment and heavy naval vessels. Since the 1990s, when the military escalated its role in the war on drugs, increasing importance has been placed on acquiring airborne surveillance platforms, aircraft, helicopters, digital war-fighting technologies, urban warfare equipment and rapid troop transport.Mexico has the capabilities to manufacture nuclear weapons, but abandoned this possibility with the Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1968 and pledged to only use its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. In 1970, Mexico's national institute for nuclear research successfully refined weapons grade uranium which is used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons but in April 2010, Mexico agreed to turn over its weapons grade uranium to the United States.Historically, Mexico has remained neutral in international conflicts, with the exception of World War II. However, in recent years some political parties have proposed an amendment of the Constitution to allow the Mexican Army, Air Force or Navy to collaborate with the United Nations in peacekeeping missions, or to provide military help to countries that officially ask for it. Mexico signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\n\n=== Political divisions ===\n\nThe United Mexican States are a federation of 31 free and sovereign states, which form a union that exercises a degree of jurisdiction over Mexico City.Each state has its own constitution, congress, and a judiciary, and its citizens elect by direct voting a governor for a six-year term, and representatives to their respective unicameral state congresses for three-year terms.Mexico City is a special political division that belongs to the federation as a whole and not to a particular state. Formerly known as the Federal District, its autonomy was previously limited relative to that of the states. It dropped this designation in 2016 and is in the process of achieving greater political autonomy by becoming a federal entity with its own constitution and congress.The states are divided into municipalities, the smallest administrative political entity in the country, governed by a mayor or municipal president (presidente municipal), elected by its residents by plurality.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs of April 2018, Mexico has the 15th largest nominal GDP (US$1.15 trillion) and the 11th largest by purchasing power parity (US$2.45 trillion). GDP annual average growth was 2.9% in 2016 and 2% in 2017. Agriculture has comprised 4% of the economy over the last two decades, while industry contributes 33% (mostly automotive, oil, and electronics) and services (notably financial services and tourism) contribute 63%. Mexico's GDP in PPP per capita was US$18,714.05. The World Bank reported in 2009 that the country's Gross National Income in market exchange rates was the second highest in Latin America, after Brazil at US$1,830.392 billion, which led to the highest income per capita in the region at $15,311. Mexico is now firmly established as an upper middle-income country. After the slowdown of 2001 the country has recovered and has grown 4.2, 3.0 and 4.8 percent in 2004, 2005 and 2006, even though it is considered to be well below Mexico's potential growth. The International Monetary Fund predicts growth rates of 2.3% and 2.7% for 2018 and 2019, respectively.Although multiple international organizations coincide and classify Mexico as an upper middle income country, or a middle class country  Mexico's National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL), which is the organization in charge to measure the country's poverty reports that a huge percentage of Mexico's population lives in poverty. According to said council, from 2006 to 2010 (year on which the CONEVAL published its first nationwide report of poverty) the portion of Mexicans who live in poverty rose from 18%-19% to 46% (52 million people). However, rather than Mexico's economy crashing, international economists attribute the huge increase in the percentage of population living below the country's poverty line to the CONEVAL using new standards to define it, as now besides people who lives below the economic welfare line, people who lacks at least one \"social need\" such as complete education, access to healthcare, access to regular food, housing services and goods, social security etc. were considered to be living in poverty (several countries do collect information regarding the persistence of said vulnerabilities on their population, but Mexico is the only one that classifies people lacking one or more of those needs as living below its national poverty line). Said economists do point out that the percentage of people living in poverty according to Mexico's national poverty line is around 40 times higher than the one reported by the World Bank's international poverty line (with said difference being the biggest in the world) and ponder if it would not be better for countries in the situation of Mexico to adopt internationalized standards to measure poverty so the numbers obtained could be used to make accurate international comparisons. According to the OECD's own poverty line (defined as the percentage of a country's population who earns 60% or less of the national median income) 20% of Mexico's population lives in a situation of poverty.\n\nAmong the OECD countries, Mexico has the second-highest degree of economic disparity between the extremely poor and extremely rich, after Chile \u2013 although it has been falling over the last decade, being one of few countries in which this is the case. The bottom ten percent in the income hierarchy disposes of 1.36% of the country's resources, whereas the upper ten percent dispose of almost 36%. The OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average. This is also reflected by the fact that infant mortality in Mexico is three times higher than the average among OECD nations whereas its literacy levels are in the median range of OECD nations. Nevertheless, according to Goldman Sachs, by 2050 Mexico will have the 5th largest economy in the world.According to a 2008 UN report the average income in a typical urbanized area of Mexico was $26,654, while the average income in rural areas just miles away was only $8,403. Daily minimum wages are set annually being set at $102.68 Mexican pesos (US$5.40) in 2019.The electronics industry of Mexico has grown enormously within the last decade. Mexico has the sixth largest electronics industry in the world after China, United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Mexico is the second-largest exporter of electronics to the United States where it exported $71.4 billion worth of electronics in 2011. The Mexican electronics industry is dominated by the manufacture and OEM design of televisions, displays, computers, mobile phones, circuit boards, semiconductors, electronic appliances, communications equipment and LCD modules. The Mexican electronics industry grew 20% between 2010 and 2011, up from its constant growth rate of 17% between 2003 and 2009. Currently electronics represent 30% of Mexico's exports.\n\nMexico produces the most automobiles of any North American nation. The industry produces technologically complex components and engages in some research and development activities. The \"Big Three\" (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler) have been operating in Mexico since the 1930s, while Volkswagen and Nissan built their plants in the 1960s. In Puebla alone, 70 industrial part-makers cluster around Volkswagen. In the 2010s expansion of the sector was surging. In 2014 alone, more than $10 billion in investment was committed. In September 2016 Kia motors opened a $1 billion factory in Nuevo Le\u00f3n, with Audi also opening an assembling plant in Puebla the same year. BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Nissan currently have plants in constructuion.The domestic car industry is represented by DINA S.A., which has built buses and trucks since 1962, and the new Mastretta company that builds the high-performance Mastretta MXT sports car. In 2006, trade with the United States and Canada accounted for almost 50% of Mexico's exports and 45% of its imports. During the first three quarters of 2010, the United States had a $46.0 billion trade deficit with Mexico. In August 2010 Mexico surpassed France to become the 9th largest holder of US debt. The commercial and financial dependence on the US is a cause for concern.The remittances from Mexican citizens working in the United States account for 0.2% of Mexico's GDP which was equal to US$20 billion per year in 2004 and is the tenth largest source of foreign income after oil, industrial exports, manufactured goods, electronics, heavy industry, automobiles, construction, food, banking and financial services. According to Mexico's central bank, remittances in 2008 amounted to $25bn.By 2050, Mexico could potentially become the world's fifth or seventh largest economy.\n\n\n=== Communications ===\n\nThe telecommunications industry is mostly dominated by Telmex (Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico), privatized in 1990. By 2006, Telmex had expanded its operations to Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and the United States. Other players in the domestic industry are Axtel, Maxcom, Alestra, Marcatel, AT&T Mexico. Because of Mexican orography, providing a landline telephone service at remote mountainous areas is expensive, and the penetration of line-phones per capita is low compared to other Latin American countries, at 40 percent; however, 82% of Mexicans over the age of 14 own a mobile phone. Mobile telephony has the advantage of reaching all areas at a lower cost, and the total number of mobile lines is almost two times that of landlines, with an estimation of 63 million lines. The telecommunication industry is regulated by the government through Cofetel (Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Telecomunicaciones).\nThe Mexican satellite system is domestic and operates 120 earth stations. There is also extensive microwave radio relay network and considerable use of fiber-optic and coaxial cable. Mexican satellites are operated by Sat\u00e9lites Mexicanos (Satmex), a private company, leader in Latin America and servicing both North and South America. It offers broadcast, telephone and telecommunication services to 37 countries in the Americas, from Canada to Argentina. Through business partnerships Satmex provides high-speed connectivity to ISPs and Digital Broadcast Services. Satmex maintains its own satellite fleet with most of the fleet being designed and built in Mexico.\nMajor players in the broadcasting industry are Televisa, the largest Mexican media company in the Spanish-speaking world, TV Azteca and Imagen Televisi\u00f3n.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\n\nEnergy production in Mexico is managed by the state-owned companies Federal Commission of Electricity and Pemex.\nPemex, the public company in charge of exploration, extraction, transportation and marketing of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the refining and distribution of petroleum products and petrochemicals, is one of the largest companies in the world by revenue, making US$86 billion in sales a year. Mexico is the sixth-largest oil producer in the world, with 3.7 million barrels per day. In 1980 oil exports accounted for 61.6% of total exports; by 2000 it was only 7.3%.The largest hydro plant in Mexico is the 2,400 MW Manuel Moreno Torres Dam in Chicoas\u00e9n, Chiapas, in the Grijalva River. This is the world's fourth most productive hydroelectric plant.Mexico is the country with the world's third largest solar potential. The country's gross solar potential is estimated at 5kWh/m2 daily, which corresponds to 50 times national electricity generation. Currently, there is over 1 million square meters of solar thermal panels installed in Mexico, while in 2005, there were 115,000 square meters of solar PV (photo-voltaic). It is expected that in 2012 there will be 1,8 million square meters of installed solar thermal panels.The project named SEGH-CFE 1, located in Puerto Libertad, Sonora, Northwest of Mexico, will have capacity of 46.8 MW from an array of 187,200 solar panels when complete in 2013. All of the electricity will be sold directly to the CFE and absorbed into the utility's transmission system for distribution throughout their existing network. At an installed capacity of 46.8 MWp, when complete in 2013, the project will be the first utility scale project of its kind in Mexico and the largest solar project of any kind in Latin America.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\n\nThe National Autonomous University of Mexico was officially established in 1910, and the university became one of the most important institutes of higher learning in Mexico. UNAM provides world class education in science, medicine, and engineering. Many scientific institutes and new institutes of higher learning, such as National Polytechnic Institute (founded in 1936), were established during the first half of the 20th century. Most of the new research institutes were created within UNAM. Twelve institutes were integrated into UNAM from 1929 to 1973. In 1959, the Mexican Academy of Sciences was created to coordinate scientific efforts between academics.\nIn 1995, the Mexican chemist Mario J. Molina shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Paul J. Crutzen and F. Sherwood Rowland for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone. Molina, an alumnus of UNAM, became the first Mexican citizen to win the Nobel Prize in science.In recent years, the largest scientific project being developed in Mexico was the construction of the Large Millimeter Telescope (Gran Telescopio Milim\u00e9trico, GMT), the world's largest and most sensitive single-aperture telescope in its frequency range. It was designed to observe regions of space obscured by stellar dust.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAs of 2017, Mexico was the 6th most visited country in the world and had the 15th highest income from tourism in the world which is also the highest in Latin America. The vast majority of tourists come to Mexico from the United States and Canada followed by Europe and Asia. A smaller number also come from other Latin American countries. In the 2017 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, Mexico was ranked 22nd in the world, which was 3rd in the Americas.The coastlines of Mexico harbor many stretches of beaches that are frequented by sunbathers and other visitors. According to national law, the entirety of the coastlines are under federal ownership, that is, all beaches in the country are public. On the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, one of the most popular beach destinations is the resort town of Canc\u00fan, especially among university students during spring break. Just offshore is the beach island of Isla Mujeres, and to the east is the Isla Holbox. To the south of Cancun is the coastal strip called Riviera Maya which includes the beach town of Playa del Carmen and the ecological parks of Xcaret and Xel-H\u00e1. A day trip to the south of Canc\u00fan is the historic port of Tulum. In addition to its beaches, the town of Tulum is notable for its cliff-side Mayan ruins.\nOn the Pacific coast is the notable tourist destination of Acapulco. Once the destination for the rich and famous, the beaches have become crowded and the shores are now home to many multi-story hotels and vendors. Acapulco is home to renowned cliff divers: trained divers who leap from the side of a vertical cliff into the surf below.\nAt the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is the resort town of Cabo San Lucas, a town noted for its beaches and marlin fishing. Further north along the Sea of Cort\u00e9s is the Bah\u00eda de La Concepci\u00f3n, another beach town known for its sports fishing. Closer to the United States border is the weekend draw of San Felipe, Baja California.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nThe roadway network in Mexico is extensive and all areas in the country are covered by it. The roadway network in Mexico has an extent of 366,095 km (227,481 mi), of which 116,802 km (72,577 mi) are paved, making it the largest paved-roadway network in Latin America. Of these, 10,474 km (6,508 mi) are multi-lane expressways: 9,544 km (5,930 mi) are four-lane highways and the rest have 6 or more lanes.Starting in the late nineteenth century, Mexico was one of the first Latin American countries to promote railway development, and the network covers 30,952 km (19,233 mi). The Secretary of Communications and Transport of Mexico proposed a high-speed rail link that will transport its passengers from Mexico City to Guadalajara, Jalisco. The train, which will travel at 300 kilometres per hour (190 miles per hour), will allow passengers to travel from Mexico City to Guadalajara in just 2 hours. The whole project was projected to cost 240 billion pesos, or about 25 billion US$ and is being paid for jointly by the Mexican government and the local private sector including the wealthiest man in the world, Mexico's billionaire business tycoon Carlos Slim. The government of the state of Yucat\u00e1n is also funding the construction of a high speed line connecting the cities of Cozumel to M\u00e9rida and Chichen Itza and Canc\u00fan.Mexico has 233 airports with paved runways; of these, 35 carry 97% of the passenger traffic. The Mexico City International Airport remains the busiest in Latin America and the 36th busiest in the world transporting 45 million passengers a year.\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\nAmong the achievements is a significant increase in access to piped water supply in urban areas (88% to 93%) as well as in rural areas (50% to 74%) between 1990 and 2010. Additionally, a strong nationwide increase in access to improved sanitation (64% to 85%) was observed in the same period. Other achievements include the existence of a functioning national system to finance water and sanitation infrastructure with a National Water Commission as its apex institution; and the existence of a few well-performing utilities such as Aguas y Drenaje de Monterrey.\nThe challenges include water scarcity in the northern and central parts of the country; inadequate water service quality (drinking water quality; 11% of Mexicans receiving water only intermittently as of 2014); poor technical and commercial efficiency of most utilities (with an average level of non-revenue water of 43.2% in 2010); an insufficient share of wastewater receiving treatment (36% in 2006); and still inadequate access in rural areas. In addition to on-going investments to expand access, the government has embarked on a large investment program to improve wastewater treatment.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the population of Mexico had barely doubled. This trend continued during the first two decades of the 20th century, and even in the 1921 census there was a loss of about 1 million inhabitants. The phenomenon can be explained because during the decade from 1910 to 1921 the Mexican Revolution took place.\nThe growth rate increased dramatically between the 1930s and the 1980s, when the country registered growth rates of over 3% (1950\u20131980). The Mexican population doubled in twenty years, and at that rate it was expected that by the year 2000 there would be 120 million Mexicans. Life expectancy went from 36 years (in 1895) to 72 years (in the year 2000).\nAccording to estimations made by Mexico's National Geography and Statistics Institute, as of 2017 Mexico has 123.5 million inhabitants making it the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world. Between 2005 and 2010, the Mexican population grew at an average of 1.70% per year, up from 1.16% per year between 2000 and 2005.\n\nEven though Mexico is a very ethnically diverse country, research about ethnicity has largely been a forgotten field, in consequence of the post-revolutionary efforts of Mexico's government to unify all non-indigenous Mexicans under a single ethnic identity (that of the \"Mestizo\"). As a result, since 1930 the only explicit ethnic classification that has been included in Mexican censuses has been that of \"Indigenous peoples\". Even then, across the years the government has used different criteria to count Indigenous peoples, with each of them returning considerably different numbers. It is not until very recently that the Mexican government begun conducting surveys that considered the Afro-Mexican and Euro-Mexican population that lives in the country.\nAs of 2017, it is estimated that 1.2 million foreigners have settled in the country, up from nearly 1 million in 2010. The vast majority of migrants come from the United States (900,000), making Mexico the top destination for U.S. citizens abroad. The second largest group comes from neighboring Guatemala (54,500), followed by Spain (27,600). Other major sources of migration are fellow Latin American countries, which include Colombia (20,600), Argentina (19,200) and Cuba (18,100). Historically, the Lebanese diaspora and the German-born Mennonite migration have left a notorious impact in the country's culture, particularly in its cuisine and traditional music. At the turn of the 21st century, several trends have increased the number of foreigners residing in the country such as the 2008\u20132014 Spanish financial crisis, increasing gang-related violence in the Northern Triangle of Central America, the ongoing political and economic crisis in Venezuela, and the automotive industry boom led by Japanese and South Korean investment.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity and race ===\n\nDespite being a diverse country; the majority of Mexicans are united under the same national identity. This is the product of an ideology strongly promoted by Mexican academics and politicians such as Manuel Gamio and Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos known as mestizaje, whose goal was that of Mexico becoming a racially and culturally homogeneous country, which in practice was reflected in Mexico's national censuses of 1921 and 1930: According to the former, approximately 60% of Mexico's population identified as Mestizos, and in the later, Mexico's government declared that all Mexicans were now Mestizos, for which racial classifications would be dropped in favor of language-based ones in future censuses. Nowadays, historians and academics consider that a good number of people were classified under the \"mestizo identity\" by the government regardless of whether they were of mixed ancestry or not, as the population trends reported in those censuses are incongruent with those exhibited in earlier censuses and modern research has observed that when asked directly about their ethno-racial identification, many Mexicans do not identify as Mestizos, being also noted that ethnoracial labels such as \"White\" or \"Indian\" are far more prominent in everyday Mexican society than the \"Mestizo\" one is, whose use is mostly limited to intellectual circles.The total percentage of Mexico's indigenous peoples tends to vary depending of the criteria used by the government on its censuses: it is 5.4% if the ability to speak an indigenous language is used as the criteria to define a person as indigenous, if racial self-identification is used it is 14.9% and if people who consider themselves part indigenous are also included it amounts to 23%. Nonetheless, all the censuses conclude that the majority of Mexico's indigenous population is concentrated in rural areas of the southern and south-eastern Mexican states such as Yucat\u00e1n at 59%, Quintana Roo 39% and Campeche 27%, who are chiefly Maya; Oaxaca with 48% of the population, the most numerous groups being the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples; Chiapas at 28%, the majority being Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya; Hidalgo 24%, the majority being Otomi; Puebla 19%, and Guerrero 17%, mostly Nahua peoples and the states of San Luis Potos\u00ed and Veracruz are both home to a population that is 15% indigenous, mostly from the Totonac, Nahua and Teenek (Huastec) groups. All of the indices of social development for the indigenous population are considerably lower than the national average which is motive of concern for Mexico's government.Similarly to Mestizo and indigenous peoples, estimates of the percentage of European-descended Mexicans vary considerably: according to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica which uses as reference the 1921 census, their numbers range from around 10%\u201320% (the results of the 1921 census, however, have been contested by various historians and deemed inaccurate). Recent nationwide field surveys that account for different phenotypical traits (hair color, skin color etc.) on the other hand, report rather higher percentages, with it being between 18%-23% if the criteria is the presence of blond hair, and of 47% if the criteria is skin color, with the later surveys having been conducted by Mexico's government. While during the colonial era, most of the European migration into Mexico was Spanish, in the 19th and 20th centuries a substantial number of non-Spanish Europeans immigrated to the country, with Europeans often being the most numerous ethnic group in colonial Mexican cities. Nowadays Mexico's northern and western regions have the highest percentages of European populations, with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly European ancestry.\n\nThe Afro-Mexican population (1,381,853 individuals as of 2015) is an ethnic group made up of descendants of Colonial-era slaves and recent immigrants of sub-Saharan African descent. Mexico had an active slave trade during the colonial period, and some 200,000 Africans were taken there, primarily in the 17th century. The creation of a national Mexican identity, especially after the Mexican Revolution, emphasized Mexico's indigenous and European past; it passively eliminated the African ancestors and contributions. Most of the African-descended population was absorbed into the surrounding Mestizo (mixed European/indigenous) and indigenous populations through unions among the groups. Evidence of this long history of intermarriage with Mestizo and indigenous Mexicans is also expressed in the fact that in the 2015 inter-census, 64.9% (896,829) of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous. It was also reported that 9.3% of Afro-Mexicans speak an indigenous language. The states with the highest self-report of Afro-Mexicans were Guerrero (6.5% of the population), Oaxaca (4.95%) and Veracruz (3.28%). Afro-Mexican culture is strongest in the communities of the Costa Chica of Oaxaca and Costa Chica of Guerrero.\nDuring the early 20th century, a substantial number of Arabs (mostly Christians) began arriving from the crumbling Ottoman Empire. The largest group were the Lebanese and an estimated 400,000 Mexicans have some Lebanese ancestry. Smaller ethnic groups in Mexico include South and East Asians, present since the colonial era. During the colonial era Asians were termed Chino (regardless of ethnicity), and arrived as merchants, artisans and slaves. A study by Juan Esteban Rodr\u00edguez, a graduate student at the National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity, indicated that up to one third of people sampled from Guerrero state had significantly more Asian ancestry than most Mexicans, primarily Filipino or Indonesian. Modern Asian immigration began in the late 19th century, and at one point in the early 20th century the Chinese were the second largest immigrant group.\n\n\n==== Official censuses ====\nAccording to indepentent Mexico's first-ever (but second-ever counting New Spain's) national census that considered race, made right after the Mexican revolution in 1921, 59% of Mexico's population was Mestizo, 29% was Indigenous, and 9% was European, with Mestizos being the most numerous ethno-racial group in almost all the states. For a long time this census' results were taken as fact, with extraofficial international publications such as The World Factbook and Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica using them as a reference to estimate Mexico's racial composition up to this day. In recent time nonetheless, Mexican academics have subjected the census' results to scrutiny, claiming that such a drastic alteration in demographic trends in regards to New Spain's 1793 census (on which Europeans were estimated to be 18% to 22% of the population, Mestizos 21% to 25% and Indigenous peoples 51% to 61%) is not possible and cite, among other statistics the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico. Said authors claim that the Mexican society went through a \"more cultural than biological mestizaje process\" sponsored by the state in its efforts to unify the Mexican population which resulted in the inflation of the percentage of the Mestizo Mexican group at the expense of the identity of the other races that exist in Mexico.In recent times the Mexican government has decided to conduct new ethnic surveys and censuses, also widening the criteria to classify the ethnicities who were already considered such as the Indigenous Mexican one, which was previously reserved to people who lived in indigenous communities or spoke an indigenous language. According to these recent surveys, Indigenous peoples amount to 23% of Mexico's population (including people who declared to be partially indigenous), Afro-Mexicans are 2% of Mexico's population. (including people who declared to be partially African) and White or European Mexicans amount to 47% of Mexico's population (based on appearance rather than on self-declared of ancestry). Less numerous groups in Mexico such as Asians and Middle Easterners are also accounted for. Out of all the ethnic groups that have recently been surveyed, that of Mestizos is notably absent, which may be consequence of the ethnic label's fluid and subjective definition, which complicates a precise calculation as well the tendency that Mexicans have to identify people with \"static\" ethnic labels rather than \"fluid\" ones.\n\n\n=== Emigration ===\n\nIn the early 1960s, around 600,000 Mexicans lived abroad, which increased sevenfold by the 1990s to 4.4 million. At the turn of the 21st century, this figure more than doubled to 9.5 million. As of 2017, it is estimated that 12.9 million Mexicans live abroad, primarily in the United States, which concentrates nearly 98% of the expatriate population. The majority of Mexicans have settled in states such as California, Texas and Illinois, particularly around the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth. As a result of these major migration flows in recent decades, around 36 million U.S. residents, or 11.2% of the country's population, identified as being of full or partial Mexican ancestry. The remaining 2% of expatriates have settled in Canada (86,000), primarily in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, followed by Spain (49,000) and Germany (18,000), both European destinations represent almost two-thirds of the Mexican population living in the continent. As for Latin America, it is estimated that 69,000 Mexicans live in the region, Guatemala (18,000) being the top destination for expatriates, followed by Bolivia (10,000) and Panama (5,000).\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nSpanish is the de facto national language spoken by the vast majority of the population, making Mexico the world's most populous Hispanophone country. Mexican Spanish refers to the varieties of the language spoken in the country, which differ from one region to another in sound, structure, and vocabulary. In general, Mexican Spanish does not make any phonetic distinction among the letters s and z, as well as c when preceding the vowels e and i, as opposed to Peninsular Spanish. The letters b and v have the same pronunciation as well. Furthermore, the usage of vos, the second person singular pronoun, found in several Latin American varieties, is replaced by t\u00fa; whereas vosotros, the second person plural pronoun, fell out of use and was effectively replaced by ustedes. In written form, the Spanish Royal Academy serves as the primary guideline for spelling, except for words of Amerindian origin that retain their original phonology such as cenzontle instead of sinzontle and M\u00e9xico not M\u00e9jico. Words of foreign origin also maintain their original spelling such as whisky and film, as opposed to g\u00fcisqui and filme as the Royal Academy suggests. The letter x is distinctly used in Mexican Spanish, which may be pronounced as [ks] (as in ox\u00edgeno or taxi), as [\u0283] particularly in Amerindian words (e.g. mixiote, Xola and uxmal) and as the voiceless velar fricative [x] (such as Texas and Oaxaca).The federal government officially recognizes sixty-eight linguistic groups and 364 varieties of indigenous languages. It is estimated that around 8.3 million citizens speak these languages, with Nahuatl being the most widely spoken by more than 1.7 million, followed by Yucatec Maya used daily by nearly 850,000 people, Tzeltal and Tzotzil, two variants of the Mayan languages, are spoken by around half a million people each, primarily in the southern state of Chiapas. Mixtec and Zapotec, both with estimated 500,000 native speakers each, are two other well-known language groups. Since its creation in March 2003, the National Indigenous Languages Institute has been in charge of promoting and protecting the use of the country's indigenous languages, through the General Law of Indigenous Peoples' Linguistic Rights, which recognizes them de jure as \"national languages\" with status equal to that of Spanish. Notwithstanding, in practice, indigenous peoples often face discrimination and are unable to have proper access to public services such as education and healthcare, as well as the justice system, as Spanish is the prominent language.Aside from indigenous languages, there are several minority languages spoken in Mexico due to international migration such as Low German by the 80,000-strong Menonite population, primarily settled in the northern states, fuelled by the tolerance of the federal government towards this community by allowing them to set their own educational system compatible with their customs and traditions. The Chipilo dialect, a variance of the Venetian language, is spoken in the town of Chipilo, located in the central state of Puebla, by around 2,500 people, mainly descendants of Venetians that migrated to the area in the late 19th century. Furthermore, English is the most commonly taught foreign language in Mexico. It is estimated that nearly 24 million, or around a fifth of the population, study the language through public schools, private institutions or self-access channels. However, a high level of English proficiency is limited to only 5% of the population. Moreover, French is the second most widely taught foreign language, as every year between 200,000 and 250,000 Mexican students enroll in language courses.\n\n\n=== Urban areas ===\n\nThe 20 largest cities in Mexico as of the 2010 census. Ecatepec and Nezahualc\u00f3yotl are part of Metropolitan Mexico City; Ju\u00e1rez is northern border city, directly across from El Paso, Texas; Tijuana is across from San Diego, California; and Mexicali is across from Calexico, California. \n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe 2010 census by the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda (National Institute of Statistics and Geography) gave Roman Catholicism as the main religion, with 82.7% of the population, while 10% (10,924,103) belong to other Christian denominations, including Evangelicals (5%); Pentecostals (1.6%); other Protestant or Reformed (0.7%); Jehovah's Witnesses (1.4%); Seventh-day Adventists (0.6%); and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (0.3%). 172,891 (or less than 0.2% of the total) belonged to other, non-Christian religions; 4.7% declared having no religion; 2.7% were unspecified.\n\nThe 92,924,489 Catholics of Mexico constitute in absolute terms the second largest Catholic community in the world, after Brazil's. 47% percent of them attend church services weekly. The feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, is celebrated on 12 December and is regarded by many Mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country. In spite of this, the Mexican State is officially lay secularist since the separation between religious institutions and the political administration of the nation was enshrined in the 1857, and was ratified in the current Constitution of 1917. Catholic priest and insurgent for independence, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos, called for Roman Catholicism to be the exclusive faith in Mexico. A provision of the Plan of Iguala of Agust\u00edn de Iturbide bringing about Mexican independence in 1821, also included Catholic exclusivity in the religious sphere. The Constitution of 1824 declared that the official religion of the Republic would be Catholic. Mexican liberals took power in the mid-nineteenth-century, determined to curtail the power of the Roman Catholic Church, and embedded anticlericalism in the Constitution of 1857, touching off the civil war, the War of the Reform (1858\u201361), largely over religion. Conservatives were defeated on the battlefield and then sought a foreign ally for their cause of religion, aligning with the French, who placed Maximilian Hapsburg as monarch in the Second Mexican Empire (1862\u201367).  The Mexican republic defeated the Conservatives and executed Maximilian and two prominent Mexican generals, definitively ending the Conservative attempt to reassert the power of the Catholic Church. Liberal general and President Porfirio D\u00edaz (r. 1876\u201380; 1880-1911) did not provoke the Catholic Church, coming to a modus vivendi with it; but he did not remove the anticlerical articles from the 1857 Constitution. From the late nineteenth century Porfiriato, Protestants began to make inroads in Mexico.  The Mexican Revolution had a large number of Protestants participating in northern Mexico. The Constitution of 1917 strengthened the anticlerical provisions that were carried over from the 1857 Constitution.\nThe late 1920s was marked by a religious conflict known as the Cristero War (1926\u201329), when former revolutionary general, President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles (1924\u201328), began stringently enforcing the anticlerical provisions of the Constitution of 1917, it provoked a massive uprising in many parts of Mexico and resistance by the Roman Catholic Church. The war ended with an agreement between the parties in conflict (Catholic Church and State), by means of which the respective fields of action were defined. When President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sought Mexico's inclusion in the North American Free Trade Agreement, the constitution was changed in 1992 to eliminate the anticlerical articles long opposed by the Catholic Church and other religious institutions; the anticlerical articles were considered a violation of freedom of religion. Mexico reestablished of diplomatic relations with the Holy See, to which the Mexican State did not recognize as a political entity.\n\nAccording to the figures of INEGI, most Mexicans declare themselves Christian and most Catholics (almost 93 million adherents according to the census of 2010).\nThe second-largest Christian group is the Jehovah's Witnesses, which totals more than 1 million adherents, making the Mexican congregation of this Christian branch the second largest worldwide. Ranked third-largest in Mexico is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose members are known as Mormons; the 2010 census reported 314,932 members, though the church in 2009 claimed to have over one million registered members. Fourth largest is Church of the La Luz del Mundo, which has its center in \"La Hermosa Provincia\", a colony of Guadalajara. The denominations Pentecostal also have an important presence, especially in the cities of the border and in the indigenous communities. In fact, Pentecostal churches together have more than 1.3 million adherents, which in net numbers place them as the second Christian creed in Mexico. The situation changes when the different Pentecostal denominations are considered as separate entities. Other groups are growing, such as Iglesia apost\u00f3lica de la Fe en Cristo Jes\u00fas, Mennonites and Seventh-day Adventist Church. Migratory phenomena have led to the spread of different aspects of Christianity, including branches Protestants, Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox Church.\nAccording to Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum (in texts edited by the National Autonomous University of Mexico), it is remarkable the survival of magic-religious rituals of the old indigenous groups, not only in the current indigenous people but in the mestizos and whites that make up the Mexican rural and urban society. There is often a syncretism between shamanism and the Catholic tradition. Another religion of popular syncretism in Mexico (especially in recent years) is the Santer\u00eda. This is mainly due to the large number of Cubans who settled in the territory after the Cuban Revolution (mainly in states such as Veracruz and Yucat\u00e1n). Although Mexico was also a recipient of black slaves from Africa in the 16th century, the apogee of these cults is relatively new.In certain regions, the profession of a creed other than the Catholic is seen as a threat to community unity. It is argued that the Catholic religion is part of the ethnic identity, and that the Protestants are not willing to participate in the traditional customs and practices (the tequio or community work, participation in the festivities and similar issues). The refusal of the Protestants is because their religious beliefs do not allow them to participate in the cult of images. In extreme cases, tension between Catholics and Protestants has led to the expulsion or even murder of Protestants in several villages. The best known cases are those of San Juan Chamula, in Chiapas, and San Nicol\u00e1s, in Ixmiquilpan, Hidalgo.\n\nA similar argument was presented by a committee of anthropologists to request the government of the Republic to expel the Summer Linguistic Institute (SIL), in the year 1979, which was accused of promoting the division of indigenous peoples by translating the Bible into vernacular languages and evangelizing in a Protestant creed that threatened the integrity of popular cultures. The Mexican government paid attention to the call of the anthropologists and canceled the agreement that had held with the SIL. Conflicts have also occurred in other areas of social life. For example, given that Jehovah's Witnesses are prohibited from surrendering honors to national symbols (something that is done every Monday in Mexican public schools), children who have been educated in that religion were expelled from public schools. This type of problem can only be solved with the intervention of the National Commission of Human Rights, and not always with favorable results for children.\nThe impact of the Catholic religion in Mexico has also caused a fusion of elements. Beyond churches and religious denominations, a phenomenon persists in Mexico that some anthropologists and sociologists call \"popular religion\", that is, religion as the practice and understanding of the people. In Mexico, the main component is the Catholic religion, to which elements of other beliefs have been added, already of pre-Hispanic, African or Asian origin. In general, popular religiosity is viewed with bad eyes by institutionally structured religions. One of the most exemplary cases of popular religiosity is the cult of Holy Dead (Santa Muerte). The Catholic hierarchy insists on describing it as a satanic cult. However, most of the people who profess this cult declare themselves to be Catholic believers, and consider that there is no contradiction between the tributes they offer to the Christ Child and the adoration of God. Other examples are the representations of the Passion of Christ and the celebration of Day of the Dead, which take place within the framework of the Catholic Christian imaginary, but under a very particular reinterpretation of its protagonists.\nThe presence of Jews in Mexico dates back to 1521, when Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s conquered the Aztecs, accompanied by several Conversos.  According to the 2010 census, there are 67,476 Jews in Mexico. Islam in Mexico is practiced mostly by Arab Mexicans. In the 2010 census 18,185 Mexicans reported belonging to an Eastern religion, a category which includes a tiny Buddhist population.\n\n\n=== Women ===\n\n \nUntil the twentieth century, Mexico was an overwhelmingly rural country, with rural women's status defined within the context of the family and local community.  With urbanization beginning in the sixteenth century, following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire, cities have provided economic and social opportunities not possible within rural villages.  Beginning in the late nineteenth century, women including middle-class women began working outside the home in offices and factories, and the gained access to education. Women were granted suffrage in 1953. In the 21st century, Mexican women are prominent in politics, academia, journalism, literature, and visual arts among other fields. In President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador's first cabinet following his 2018 election, he appointed women in equal numbers as men. However, a wave of feminism in 2020 has criticized the president for his tone-deaf response to murders of women in Mexico.Mexico is among the countries that treat particular murders of women as femicide. In 2014, Mexico had the 16th highest rate of homicides committed against women in the world. The remains of the victims were frequently mutilated. According to a 1997 study, domestic abuse in Mexican culture \"is embedded in gender and marital relations fostered in Mexican women's dependence on their spouses for subsistence and for self-esteem, sustained by ideologies of romantic love, by family structure and residential arrangements\". The perpetrators are often the boyfriend, father-in-law, ex-husbands or husbands but only 1.6% of the murder cases led to an arrest and sentencing in 2015.  After a particularly well-publicized gruesome femicide followed by that of a kidnapped little girl, women began protesting more vociferously, falling on deaf ears, including those of President L\u00f3pez Obrador. This is the first new and major movement with which his presidency has had to deal. On International Women's Day (8 March) in 2020, women staged a massive demonstration in Mexico City with some 80,000 participants.  On Monday, 9 March 2020, the second day of action was marked by the absence of women at work, in class, shopping and other public activities.  The \"Day Without Women\" (D\u00eda Sin Nosotras) was reported in the international press along with the previous day's demonstrations.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nMexican culture reflects the complexity of the country's history through the blending of indigenous cultures and the culture of Spain, imparted during Spain's 300-year colonial rule of Mexico. Exogenous cultural elements have been incorporated into Mexican culture as time has passed.\nThe Porfirian era (el Porfiriato), in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, was marked by economic progress and peace. After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President D\u00edaz himself. Since that time, as accentuated during the Mexican Revolution, cultural identity has had its foundation in the mestizaje, of which the indigenous (i.e. Amerindian) element is the core. In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos in La Raza C\u00f3smica (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races (thus extending the definition of the mestizo) not only biologically but culturally as well. Other Mexican intellectuals grappled with the idea of Lo Mexicano, which seeks \"to discover the national ethos of Mexican culture.\" Nobel laureate Octavio Paz explores the notion of a Mexican national character in  The Labyrinth of Solitude.\n\n\n=== Painting ===\n\nPainting is one of the oldest arts in Mexico. Cave painting in Mexican territory is about 7500 years old and has been found in the caves of the Baja California Peninsula. Pre-Hispanic Mexico is present in buildings and caves, in Aztec codices, in ceramics, in garments, etc. .; examples of this are the Maya mural paintings of Bonampak, or those of Teotihuac\u00e1n, those of Cacaxtla and those of Monte Alb\u00e1n.\nMural painting with religious themes had an important flowering during the 16th century; the same in religious constructions as in houses of lineage; such is the case of the convents of Acolman, Actopan, Huejotzingo, Tecamachalco and Zinacantepec. These were also manifested in illustrated manuscripts such as the 1576 Florentine codex overseen by Franciscan Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan.  Most art in the colonial era was religious, but starting in the late seventeenth century and most prominently in the eighteenth century, secular portraits and casta painting appeared. Important painters of the late colonial period were Juan Correa, Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando and Miguel Cabrera.\nNineteenth-century painting had a marked romantic influence; landscapes and portraits were the greatest expressions of this era. Hermenegildo Bustos is one of the most appreciated painters of the historiography of Mexican art. Other painters include Santiago Rebull, F\u00e9lix Parra, Eugenio Landesio, and his noted pupil, the landscape artist Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco.Mexican painting of the 20th century has achieved world renown with figures such as David Alfaro Siqueiros, Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco, Joaqu\u00edn Clausell, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, a generation of idealists who marked the image of modern Mexico in the face of strong social and economic criticism. The Oaxacan School quickly gained fame and prestige, diffusion of ancestral and modern culture. Freedom of design is observed in relation to the color and texture of the canvases and murals as a period of transition between the 20th century and the 21st century. Federico Cant\u00fa Garza, Juan O'Gorman, and Rufino Tamayo are also important artists. Diego Rivera, the most well-known figure of Mexican muralism, painted the Man at the Crossroads at the Rockefeller Center in New York City, a huge mural that was destroyed by the Rockefellers the next year because of the inclusion of a portrait of Russian communist leader Lenin. Some of Rivera's murals are displayed at the Mexican National Palace and the Palace of Fine Arts.\nSome of the most outstanding painters in the late 20th century and early 21st century: Francisco Toledo was a Mexican Zapotec painter, sculptor, and graphic artist. In a career that spanned seven decades, Toledo produced thousands of works of art and became widely regarded as one of Mexico's most important contemporary artists. Ver\u00f3nica Ruiz de Velasco is a neofigurative painter and muralist.  Both Ver\u00f3nica Ruiz de Velasco and Francisco Toledo were students of Rufino Tamayo. Gilberto Aceves Navarro is also considered an important contemporary artist.\nThroughout history several prominent painters of different nationalities have expressed in their works the face of Mexico. Among the most outstanding we can mention are Claudio Linati, Daniel Thomas Egerton, Carl Nebel, Thomas Moran, and Leonora Carrington.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n\nSculpture was an integral part of pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican civilizations, (Mayans, Olmecs, Toltecs, Mixtecs, Aztecs), and others, usually religious in nature. From the Spanish conquest in 1521, civil and religious sculpture was created by indigenous artists, with guidance from Spaniards, so some pre-Hispanic features are evident. Since the 17th century, white and mestizo sculptors have created works with a marked influence of European classicism. After independence in 1821, sculpture was influenced by Romanticism, which tended to break the strict norms and models of classicism, while it pursued ideas influenced by realism and nationalism. Religious sculpture was reduced to a sporadic imagery, while the secular sculpture continued in portraits and monumental art of a civic nature. Between 1820 and 1880 the predominant themes were, successively: religious images, biblical scenes, allegories to the symbols of the independence insurgency, scenes and personages of pre-Hispanic history, and busts of the old aristocracy, of the nascent bourgeoisie and commanders of the pre-revolution. During the 20th century, some important exponents of Mexican sculpture are Juan Soriano, Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas, and Enrique Carbajal (also known as Sebasti\u00e1n).\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe presence of the humans in the Mexican territory has left important archaeological findings of great importance for the explanation of the habitat of primitive man and contemporary man. The Mesoamerican civilizations managed to have great stylistic development and proportion on the human and urban scale, the form was evolving from simplicity to aesthetic complexity; in the north of the country the adobe and stone architecture is manifested, the multifamily housing as we can see in Casas Grandes; and the troglodyte dwelling in caves of the Sierra Madre Occidental.  Urbanism had a great development in pre-Hispanic cultures, where we can see the magnitude of the cities of Teotihuac\u00e1n, Tollan-Xicocotitlan and M\u00e9xico-Tenochtitlan, within the environmentalist urbanism highlight the Mayan cities to be incorporated into the monumentality of its buildings with the thickness of the jungle and complex networks of roads called sakb\u00e9s. Mesoamerican architecture is noted for its pyramids which are the largest such structures outside of Ancient Egypt.\nSpanish Colonial architecture is marked by the contrast between the simple, solid construction demanded by the new environment and the Baroque ornamentation exported from Spain. Mexico, as the center of New Spain has some of the most renowned buildings built in this style.\nWith the arrival of the Spaniards, architectural theories of the Greco-Roman order with Arab influences were introduced. Due to the process of evangelization, when the first monastic temples and monasteries were built, their own models were projected, such as the mendicant monasteries, unique in their type in architecture. The interaction between Spaniards and natives gave rise to artistic styles such as the so-called tequitqui (from Nahuatl: worker). Years later the baroque and mannerism were imposed in large cathedrals and civil buildings, while rural areas are built haciendas or stately farms with Mozarabic tendencies.\n\n \nIn the 19th century the neoclassical movement arose as a response to the objectives of the republican nation, one of its examples are the Hospicio Caba\u00f1as where the strict plastic of the classical orders are represented in their architectural elements, new religious buildings also arise, civilian and military that demonstrate the presence of neoclassicism. Romanticists from a past seen through archeology show images of medieval Europe, Islamic and pre-Hispanic Mexico in the form of architectural elements in the construction of international exhibition pavilions looking for an identity typical of the national culture. The art nouveau, and the art deco were styles introduced into the design of the Palacio de Bellas Artes to mark the identity of the Mexican nation with Greek-Roman and pre-Hispanic symbols.\nModern architecture in Mexico has an important development in the plasticity of form and space, Jos\u00e9 Villagr\u00e1n Garc\u00eda develops a theory of form that sets the pattern of teaching in many schools of architecture in the country within functionalism. The emergence of the new Mexican architecture was born as a formal order of the policies of a nationalist state that sought modernity and the differentiation of other nations. The development of a Mexican modernist architecture was perhaps mostly fully manifested in the mid-1950s construction of the Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City, the main campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Designed by the most prestigious architects of the era, including Mario Pani, Eugenio Peschard, and Enrique del Moral, the buildings feature murals by artists Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jos\u00e9 Ch\u00e1vez Morado. It has since been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Juan O'Gorman was one of the first environmental architects in Mexico, developing the \"organic\" theory, trying to integrate the building with the landscape within the same approaches of Frank Lloyd Wright. In the search for a new architecture that does not resemble the styles of the past, it achieves a joint manifestation with the mural painting and the landscaping.\nThe Jalisco School was a proposal of those socio-political movements that the country demanded. Luis Barrag\u00e1n combined the shape of the space with forms of rural vernacular architecture of Mexico and Mediterranean countries (Spain-Morocco), integrating an impressive color that handles light and shade in different tones and opens a look at the international minimalism. He  won the 1980 Pritzker Prize, the highest award in architecture.\nMexican architecture is a cultural phenomenon born of the ideology of nationalist governments of the 20th century, which was shaping the identity image by its colorful and variegated ornamental elements inherited from ancestral cultures, classical and monumental forms and, subsequently, the incorporation of modernism and cutting-edge international trends.\n\n\n=== Photography ===\n\nMexico has been photographed since the nineteenth century, when the technology was first developed. During the Porfiriato, D\u00edaz realized the importance of photography in shaping the understanding of his regime and its accomplishments.  The government hired Guillermo Kahlo (father of painter Frida Kahlo) to create photographic images of Mexico's new industrial structures as well as its pre-Hispanic and colonial past.  Photographer Hugo Brehme specialized in images of \"picturesque\" Mexico, with images of Mexican places and often rural people.  During the Mexican Revolution, photographers chronicled the conflict, usually in the aftermath of a battle, since large and heavy equipment did not permit action shots. Agust\u00edn Victor Casasola is the most famous of photographer of the revolutionary era, and he collected other photographers' images in the Casasola Archive; his vast collection was purchased by the Mexican government and is now part of the government photographic repository, the Fototeca. After the revolution, Mexican photographers created photographs as art images.  Among others, notable Mexican photographers include  Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo, H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda Cobo, and Graciela Iturbide.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nMexican literature has its antecedents in the literature of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica. Poetry had a rich cultural tradition in prehispanic Mexico, being divided into two broad categories\u2014secular and religious. Aztec poetry was sung, chanted, or spoken, often to the accompanyment of a drum or a harp. While Tenochtitlan was the political capital, Texcoco was the cultural center; the Texcocan language was considered the most melodious and refined. The best well-known prehispanic poet is Nezahualcoyotl.Literature during the 16th century consisted largely of histories of Spanish conquests, and most of the writers at this time were from Spain. Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo's True History of the Conquest of Mexico is still widely read today. Spanish-born poet Bernardo de Balbuena extolled the virtues of Mexico in Grandeza mexicana (Mexican grandeur) (1604); Francisco de Terrazas was the first Mexican-born poet to attain renown. Baroque literature flourished in the 17th century; the most notable writers of this period were Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n and Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz. Sor Juana was famous in her own time, called the \"Ten Muse.\" The 18th and early 19th centuries gave us Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de Lizardi, whose The Mangy Parrot (\"El Periquillo Sarniento\"), is said to be the first Latin American novel. Several Jesuit humanists wrote at this time, and they were among the first to call for independence from Spain.Other writers include Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, Octavio Paz (Nobel Laureate), Carlos Fuentes, Alfonso Reyes, Renato Leduc, Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is, Elena Poniatowska, Mariano Azuela (Los de abajo) and Juan Rulfo (Pedro P\u00e1ramo). Bruno Traven wroteCanasta de cuentos mexicano (A basket of Mexican tales) and El tesoro de la Sierra Madre (Treasure of the Sierra Madre), Luis Spota, Jaime Sabines, Mart\u00edn Luis Guzm\u00e1n, Nellie Campobello, (Cartucho), and Valeria Luiselli (Faces in the Crowd) are also noteworthy.\n\n\n=== Cinema ===\n\nMexican films from the Golden Age in the 1940s and 1950s are the greatest examples of Latin American cinema, with a huge industry comparable to the Hollywood of those years. Mexican films were exported and exhibited in all of Latin America and Europe. Mar\u00eda Candelaria (1943) by Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez, was one of the first films awarded a Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1946, the first time the event was held after World War II. The famous Spanish-born director Luis Bu\u00f1uel realized in Mexico between 1947 and 1965 some of his masterpieces like Los Olvidados (1949) and Viridiana (1961). Famous actors and actresses from this period include Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix, Pedro Infante, Dolores del R\u00edo, Jorge Negrete and the comedian Cantinflas.\nMore recently, films such as Como agua para chocolate (1992), Cronos (1993), Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n (2001), and Pan's Labyrinth (2006) have been successful in creating universal stories about contemporary subjects, and were internationally recognized, as in the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Mexican directors Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (Amores perros, Babel, Birdman, The Revenant), Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Gravity), Guillermo del Toro, Carlos Carrera (The Crime of Father Amaro), screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and photographer Emmanuel Lubezki are some of the most known present-day film makers. Numerous Mexican actors have achieved recognition as Hollywood stars.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nThere are three major television companies in Mexico that own the primary networks and broadcast covering all nation, Televisa, TV Azteca and Imagen Television. Televisa is also the largest producer of Spanish-language content in the world and also the world's largest Spanish-language media network. Media company Grupo Imagen is another national coverage television broadcaster in Mexico, that also owns the newspaper Exc\u00e9lsior. Grupo Multimedios is another media conglomerate with Spanish-language broadcasting in Mexico, Spain, and the United States. The telenovelas are very traditional in Mexico and are translated to many languages and seen all over the world with renowned names like Ver\u00f3nica Castro, Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez and Thal\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Mexican cuisine ===\n\nIn 2005, Mexico presented the candidature of its gastronomy for World Heritage Site of UNESCO, being the first occasion in which a country had presented its gastronomic tradition for this purpose. However, in a first instance the result was negative, because the committee did not place the proper emphasis on the importance of corn in Mexican cuisine. Finally, on 16 November 2010 Mexican gastronomy was recognized as Intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO. In addition, Daniela Soto-Innes was named the best female chef in the world by The World's Best 50 Restaurants in April 2019.The origin of the current Mexican cuisine is established during the Spanish colonial era, a mixture of the foods of Spain with native indigenous ingredients. Of foods originated in Mexico is the corn, the pepper vegetables (together with Central and South America), calabazas (together with the Americas), avocados, sweet potato (together with Central and South America), the turkey (together with the Americas) and other fruits and spices. Other Indigenous products are many beans. Similarly, some cooking techniques used today are inherited from pre-Hispanic peoples, such as the nixtamalization of corn, the cooking of food in ovens at ground level, grinding in molcajete and metate. With the Spaniards came the pork, beef and chicken meats; peppercorn, sugar, milk and all its derivatives, wheat and rice, citrus fruits and another constellation of ingredients that are part of the daily diet of Mexicans.\nFrom this meeting of millennia old two culinary traditions, were born pozole, mole sauce, barbacoa and tamale is in its current forms, the chocolate, a large range of breads, tacos, and the broad repertoire of Mexican street foods. Beverages such as atole, champurrado, milk chocolate and aguas frescas were born; desserts such as acitr\u00f3n and the full range of crystallized sweets, rompope, cajeta, jericaya and the wide repertoire of delights created in the convents of nuns in all parts of the country.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nMexican society enjoys a vast array of music genres, showing the diversity of Mexican culture. Traditional music includes mariachi, banda, norte\u00f1o, ranchera and corridos; on an everyday basis most Mexicans listen to contemporary music such as pop, rock, etc. in both English and Spanish. Mexico has the largest media industry in Latin America, producing Mexican artists who are famous in Central and South America and parts of Europe, especially Spain.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nMexico's most popular sport is association football. It is commonly believed that football was introduced in Mexico by Cornish miners at the end of the 19th century. By 1902 a five-team league had emerged with a strong British influence. Mexico's top clubs are Am\u00e9rica with 12 championships, Guadalajara with 11, and Toluca with 10. Antonio Carbajal was the first player to appear in five World Cups, and Hugo S\u00e1nchez was named best CONCACAF player of the 20th century by IFFHS. Rafael M\u00e1rquez is the only Mexican to have won the Champions League.\n\nThe Mexican professional baseball league is named the Liga Mexicana de Beisbol. While usually not as strong as the United States, the Caribbean countries and Japan, Mexico has nonetheless achieved several international baseball titles. Mexican teams have won the Caribbean Series nine times. Mexico has had several players signed by Major League teams, the most famous of them being Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela.Mexico City hosted the XIX Olympic Games in 1968, making it the first Latin American city to do so. The country has also hosted the FIFA World Cup twice, in 1970 and 1986.In 2013, Mexico's basketball team won the Americas Basketball Championship and qualified for the 2014 Basketball World Cup where it reached the playoffs. Because of these achievements the country earned the hosting rights for the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship.Bullfighting (Spanish: corrida de toros) came to Mexico 500 years ago with the arrival of the Spanish. Despite efforts by animal rights activists to outlaw it, bullfighting remains a popular sport in the country, and almost all large cities have bullrings. Plaza M\u00e9xico in Mexico City, which seats 45,000 people, is the largest bullring in the world.\n\nMexico is an international power in professional boxing. Thirteen Olympic boxing medals have been won by Mexico.Professional wrestling (or Lucha libre in Spanish) is a major crowd draw with national promotions such as AAA, CMLL and others.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\n\nThe current coat of arms of Mexico (Spanish: Escudo Nacional de M\u00e9xico, literally \"national shield of Mexico\") has been an important symbol of politics and culture of Mexico for centuries. It depicts a Mexican golden eagle perched on a prickly pear cactus devouring a rattlesnake. The design is rooted in the legend that the Aztec people would know where to build their city once they saw an eagle eating a snake on top of a lake. To the people of Tenochtitlan, this symbol had strong religious connotations, and to the Europeans, it came to symbolize the triumph of good over evil (with the snake sometimes representative of the serpent in the Garden of Eden).\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nSince the early 1990s, Mexico entered a transitional stage in the health of its population and some indicators such as mortality patterns are identical to those found in highly developed countries like Germany or Japan. Mexico's medical infrastructure is highly rated for the most part and is usually excellent in major cities, but rural communities still lack equipment for advanced medical procedures, forcing patients in those locations to travel to the closest urban areas to get specialized medical care. Social determinants of health can be used to evaluate the state of health in Mexico.\nState-funded institutions such as Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) and the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers (ISSSTE) play a major role in health and social security. Private health services are also very important and account for 13% of all medical units in the country.Medical training is done mostly at public universities with much specializations done in vocational or internship settings. Some public universities in Mexico, such as the University of Guadalajara, have signed agreements with the U.S. to receive and train American students in Medicine. Health care costs in private institutions and prescription drugs in Mexico are on average lower than that of its North American economic partners.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nIn 2004, the literacy rate was at 97% for youth under the age of 14 and 91% for people over 15, placing Mexico at the 24th place in the world rank according to UNESCO.The National Autonomous University of Mexico ranks 103th in the QS World University Rankings, making it the best university in Mexico, after it comes the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education as the best private school in Mexico and 158th worldwide in 2019. Private business schools also stand out in international rankings. IPADE and EGADE, the business schools of Universidad Panamericana and of Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education respectively, were ranked in the top 10 in a survey conducted by The Wall Street Journal among recruiters outside the United States.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Mexico-related articles\nOutline of Mexico\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGovernment\n\nThe Government of Mexico\nMexico Tourism Official Website |VisitMexicoGeneral information\n\n\"Mexico\".

        "wiki": "Valle de la Luna (Moon Valley) is situated about 10 kilometers from downtown La Paz, in the Pedro Domingo Murillo Province, La Paz Department, Bolivia.  It consists of an area where erosion has worn away the majority of a mountain, composed primarily of clay rather than rock, leaving tall spires.  It is similar to another zone of La Paz that is known as El Valle de las Animas (The Valley of the Souls). It is an important site of the famous holiday, Dias de los Muertos (Day of the Dead).Because the mineral content of the mountains varies greatly between individual mountains, the sides of the mountains are different colors, creating striking optical illusions. A majority of them are a clear beige or light brown color, but some are almost red, with sections of dark violet.\n\n\n== See also ==\nValle de la Luna, Potos\u00ed, Bolivia (El Sillar)",

          "Beautiful place with spectacular views if on a clear day. We were told it got damaged due to social conflict last year but it is perfectly safe now. i would suggest fixing the hand rails which look worn down and not so safe. Also better signs are needed in order to know where to",
          "This geological wonder is in the center of La Paz. Was well worth the visit! Get there with enough time to wander the entire park.",
          "Spent 30.min there as part of a guided visit. Like it. The valley is quiet unique setting and gives as well a partial look onto La Paz. For me it is between 3 and 4 stars. 3 is not enough and 4 is a bit over rated.",
          "Very interesting place. Although there are many Moon and Mars canyions in the region, this one with its columns is completely unique. The atmosphere is somewhat ruined by the smell of rabbit faeces that live there. In addition, it is impossible to buy water in the canyon and the",
          "Yes, it's a nice spot, you make some pictures - and thats it. Around the corner, following the trail - it's all the same. No information boards about this special erosion that has worn away the majority of a mountain. Where are all the rocks? - or was it only \"clay-mountains\"?",
          "My friend and I were able to hire a taxi driver to take us there and it only cost about $50 US for three hours! It is quite a fascinating place. He also stopped at places along the way to show us stuff and took us to a zoo with llamas and alpacas, as well as other animals",
          "Given how hyped up the Valle de la Luna was in a lot of articles I read about La Paz before visiting, and how frequently it seems to be advertised by tourist offices around the city, I did expect it to be easier to get to. Obviously, we weren't going to pay a large sum of money",
          "This is definitely worth a visit. You can go on your own between 9-1. In the afternoon you need a reservation and then for sunset you have to go by tour. We had our own car and didn't want to pay for a tour so we had to miss the sunset here unfortunately..",
          "Beautiful natural monument, but there's lack of written informations if you decide to make a tour without a guide. A must-to-see in La Paz!",
          "Truly like being on the moon I would imagine. A large clay pan shaped by wind and water to form amazing valleys. A short drive out of La Paz it is easy to access. Not for anyone with mobility issues. Wonderful scenery. A few cacti which it seems will grow anywhere, but otherwise",
          "The view is stunning. You need about 45min to do the big circuit. A nice half day trip. Would visit again for sure!",
          "Cool to see - it\u2019s a 45minute walking track through an amazing valley and you can get some incredible photos. You don\u2019t need a tour to do this, we went to the bottom of the green line on Mi Teleferico, and caught a minivan ($2.50 Bolivianos)or you can grab a taxi ($20) - Entry",
          "Great view from the park, not hard to get there by your own , and entrance fee is fair for the placer, only thing Carry some snacks :)",
          "I always enjoy visiting Valle de la Luna. My in-laws live in San Miguel, so it's an easy trip and wonderful way to spend a couple of hours on a nice day. I also recommend lunch at Hotel Oberland a few kilometers down the road on the way to Mallasa.",
          "It was ehh...but the pictures you take are awesome! You can take a cab and have him stay as you will only need 30 minutes max.",
          "This is a sight to see and the landscape is so different then the rest of the area . Well worth the low cost and a little time to go visit it .",
          "Amassing, different, non earthly landscape, where you can take unique and unusual pictures. Put this on your \"to visit list\"! There is parking area, shop, toilet, taxi service.",
          "This landscape is worth the effort to see. Get a taxi and have them wait for you while you walk through this weird and amazing natural environment. It can be hot when walking so take water.",
          "Went there by taxi. Our driver waited for us. Easy to buy ticket. There are toilet facilities on the inside. Water and snacks available. I would recommend to this as a thing to see whilst in la Paz. It does not take very long to het there. When we visited there were not many",
          "Easy to get to. Catch a bus from near basilica. Good for an morning out afternoon, interesting shapes.",
          "We did the 2 hours jeep tour in the valley, I've seen better views in south america and in bolivia. Not a must visit",
          "Valley of the Moon is really interesting. The landscape is supposedly really similar to the moon's landscape. It is really nice to wander around and has some really nice scenery and good photo opportunities.",
          "A nice parc to spend some time in and enjoy the geological formations there. It is located a bit outside of the city, be sure to take a good taxi to join it if you don't have a car!",
          "We first heard about Moon Valley from our guide at Lake Titicaca. We were all excited when we saw it was included on our half day tour. It seemed a long trek for nothing too exciting. Yes it was more bizarre than beautiful, it just didn't float my boat. I did take a number of",
          "We went here on the local bus, as part of a tour with a guide. We spent about 45 minutes walking through the landscape as she explained the naming and development of the area. It was interesting and unusual. Take water with you as it gets quite hot during the day. We liked",
          "I was not too impressed with these formations as I am a veteran of photographing rock formations in the Southwest. Tough place to photograph as you have to deal with development all around the formations.",
          "We went by ourselves. It's not so hard to get here a taxi charged us 50 Bolivian money to get there and we were able to stay as long as we wanted. With an agency you just stay like 1 hour so better alone",
          "Really worth visiting. We did not hike the area only drove and admired the view. Breathtaking and quiet.",
          "This place is worth popping up to but it is quite a trek away from central La Paz! The structures are quite something... like a mini Wild West but it is surrounded now by buildings which to me significantly detracts from the beauty. Or perhaps that\u2019s just orientating you to",
          "I did this on one of my last days in La Paz as part of a full day tour that also covered Cachaltaya abandoned ski resort. The landscape here is certainly intriguing and worth a visit. I would say photos can't really capture the outerworldiness that you see in person. The",
          "Part of the la paz day trip first stop here. This is not actually a valley but a fantastic landscape of gullies and spires formed from an ancient bed of eroded rock where you will see eroded geological formations which look something like a desert of stalagmites.",
          "There's only one way to experience this geological inspiration and that is by two wheels and motor. not for beginners but for seasoned, confident riders who know well how to be careful while having fun. Ride free or die.",
          "It\u2019s a good place to visit if you have time in La Paz and don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s pretty small, you visit it in about 1h. No need to take a tour as the collectivo go up there for 5bob !",
          "Really interesting site located about 40 mins taxi ride for centre of La Paz. Our hotel organised a taxi to and from the site and our driver waited outside whilst we explored! (Cost 160 BOB) We took the 45 minute loop option and it wasn\u2019t a strenuous walk but offered some really",
          "The moon valley does not take the much time to do and can be done pretty quickly. The scenery is so unique for a city that it is worth visiting and walking around.",
          "We did the short version of the tour as we were running short on time. Clearly, a very interesting place which I can imagine looks a lot like the surface of the moon. Definitely worth the 30 or so minutes we spent there.",
          "You miss nothing if you have not been there. A far better opcion is take the bus to valle de las animas about 40 \u00f1in out of town.",
          "Awesome day trip and worth the 15 bolivianos. Definitely take the local collectivos which are like car shares. No need to pay a tour company commission.",
          "Really great to walk around there. It can easily be reached from La Paz with the public bus. You don't have to do a tour to see it.",
          "It not cool. It is far from downtonw, we got a huge traffic to get there . Neil Armstrong visited L\u00e1 Paz in 60's and while playing golf saw the site and sad that the place looks like the Moon surface. Do not waste your time.",
          "After spending a day on the Teleferico cable cars, we decided to head out to the Valley. We took a short taxi ride from the green station but only stayed less than 30mins as this park was insignificant especially after visiting Machu Picchu and the Sacred Valley. You can give",
          "It's a beautiful park with fabulous landscapes. There are lots of trails to walk which give you varied views of the area.",
          "Take the yellow bus out, super cheap, just flag it down outside St Francis Church. Easy walk around, there is only the 1 small tienda outside for snacks and water, nothing inside so if its hot come prepared",
          "A slight challenge of a hike due to the altitude but definitely doable. The views were worth the effort. We saw it late in the afternoon and the sun angle helped with several of the views.",
          "It's a beautiful place, though not the most interesting place I've seen in Bolivia. It's nice to spend a day there.",
          "Easy to do by yourself, get a taxi out and ask it to wait an hour while you walk round. Should cost you Bs80 for the taxi plus Bs 15 to get in. If you have plenty of time go",
          "Interesting rock formations with great views of the snow capped Andes. Only a 15 minute drive from the city, so easily accessible.",
          "Entrance fee is 15 bs and you can walk around1 hour and a half, views is really good and you can take a public car, 45 minutes away from the city",
          "The best place to see something incredible. You are at almost 4000 meters altitude in the mountains ( Andes) and all around you can see mountains of clay. No rocks, just clay. It doesn't have the aspect of the moon but is incredible unreal. You can go with a guide to tour the",
          "Take the Mallasa bus from San Francisco church to Moon Valley, no guide necessary, it's a very interesting place to wander around.",
          "Great place for a walk. Has lots of interesting formations. Also has nice paths with decent rails. Not wheel chair accessible.",
          "This is a place that is just a rock formation that has been weathered for a few million years. They put some paths in and say that Neil Armstrong visited. It is interesting but only for a short period of time.",
          "This is a great place to spend your afternoon in La Paz! It seems very small at first, but we spent much more time than we expected. The attraction was very accessible (aka don't spend money to join tours!) via cable car then taxi. Entrance fee was very affordable, and the",
          "This is such a well preserved and maintained area. It is not developed and maybe it is a bit stark but very much worth the effort",
          "Covering a \"fairly widespread\" area here are these vertical formations (like tall jagged columns although it's hard to determine their heights with their bottoms quite far down below). I walked the full circuit of the site (which takes about 45 minutes but there's the shorter",
          "This is a must to see and visit while in La paz.. So magnificent area with a natural wonder formation from mud. The walkways are so wonderful and beautiful. You can spend hours in this peaceful place. Dont forget your camera, you will take lots of amazing photos. Highly",
          "We went first thing in the morning. A good idea. The place is sort of mind boggling and so close to the city. A must.",
          "We thought it was ok and enjoyed walking about. The entrance was 15 bob each and the taxi was 40 bob each way to our accomodation in downtown La Paz. It wasn as good compared to other options in and around La Paz.",
          "This was a highlight of our trip. You can't imagine this being real, you feel like you are on another planet.",
          "This place actually could be the moon! It was a bit strange but awesome at the same time walking around looking at the craters and massive rock formations. Amazing nature at work again!",
          "We walked all around this moonscape as part of a half day tour of La Pax. Great views. Really interesting geography.",
          "Before you go, review photos taken on the moon. Then, as you walk the narrow pathways you can fully visualize why this is called Moon Valley.",
          "As the name suggests you feel like you are walking on the moon with the ups and down. Something very different and unique. Nice place to visit.",
          "The walk up to the ridge overlooking the surrounding area and amphitheatre was well worth it - fantastic views.",
          "Because l visited Capadocia several times ,this place wasnt impressed me . I am sure there are better places to visit in Bolivia",
          "Valley of the moon is a short taxi ride from the south zone of la Paz (approx 25 BOB). Entry is 15 bob per person. When we went there were only a few groups of people around the park, which made it feel very secluded like we had the place to ourselves. The rock formations",
          "It is a pity. The country lost a World Heritage Site (UNESCO) due to lack of vision. They let citizens build high-standard houses around this archaeological site. It is difficult to take a photograph that does not show houses, streets and cars. A waste of natural beauty.",
          "It is worth a visit as a break from the centre of the city. It is HOT so take water or buy some before you start the short walk. You can get there by public transport, and if you are going to go all that way I suggest you keep going after the attraction to mallasa to get some",
          "It was an interesting aspect for the middle of the city. However, after spending a week in the wild and beautiful countryside, it doesn\u2019t knock your socks off.",
          "Valley of the moon is a beautiful system of giant spires and canyons. The geological formations vary in color from beige to purple. There are walking paths and bridges that take you through the rock formations which are composed mostly of clay and sandstone. It is an interesting",
          "We booked the tour via Loki Boutique with Maya Tours. Just the most awful experience. And dangerous with no regard for the group\u2019s safety and well being. 1. Maya did not show up to pick up a friend from another hostel and refused to go back to get them. 2. The city van that we",
          "For sure this valley is an interesting geolocical formation. And if this is the ground on which La Paz is built, then it would better not rain too much in the next years. Finally we were disappointed because the whole site has the size of an average clay heap an after all we",
          "Our guide told us that this was named by Neil Armstrong as be said it looked like the surface of the moon. Don\u2019t know whether this is true but it\u2019s a nice story anyway. We spent about 40 minutes here, which I thought was about right. Some great photo ops.",
          "In the city. Amazing attraction. You must witness the landscape to absorb the experience. You can get there by city bus or inexpensive taxi ride. A must visit if in La Paz. There really is no way to express the sensation of the moment. Out of this world? Sort of.",
          "valley of the Moon had potential of being a really special landscape. If only the government had the forethought! Only 10 acres is protected, so the place is becoming surrounded by private homes. It is difficult to get a single panorama of the beauty of this place, without",
          "Went here as part of an organised full day tour with Transturin. It is truly a wonder to see, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before and has a real Star wars feel to it so. If you\u2019re in La Paz I\u2019d say it\u2019s an attraction not to miss.",
          "Very interesting and wonderful rock formations... Unlike anything iv seen before. Very easy to reach with public transport. Located in a nice town to visit also.",
          "Great place to visit - amazing that it is minutes away from downtown La Paz. One word of caution though - the steps are irregular, walkways do not have guardrails and watch where you walk as the ground is uneven. Not a problem for us but is you have children with you keep them",
          "Very interesting landscape and ambiance (the day we were there, a Christian Aymara group was recording a song, which echoed soulfully through the rocks. The whole site is lovely, and worth a visit.",
          "Interesting landscape and views. We spent about 2 hours walking around, which was sufficient. The gift shops are cute and have nice and unique items.",
          "It was a huge mountainside rock and sandstone formations with intriguing views. Looks like a NASA scientist who visited the moon expressed that the view he saw there was similar. An intersting place to visit",
          "Take the 20 minute walk and it's a walk; the 45 minute one is a hike. Lots of sandy stone steps but the wooden rails help a lot. Sort of looks like the bottom of a cave or the moon and rumor has it ( but is probably wrong) that it got its name from a visit by Neil Armstrong",
          "Had the place to ourselves. $20 from our hotel by taxi (booked by hotel) and were there and back in two hours having left the hotel at 8am. Beat the traffic by going early and returning before \u201crush hour\u201d at 12:30pm (when everyone goes home for lunch). Interesting landscape and",
          "The Valley of the moon is a really cool place to visit in La Paz. The entrance only costs 15 BOB and you can get there either by taxi, mini bus or take the Teleferico to the last station and from there a mini bus or taxi to the entrance. I recommend to wear comfortable shoes,",
          "We traveled here via taxi. We could've taken the collectivo but were pretty tired and wanted to have get there and back quickly. The taxi waited for us as we walked through the area. The path through the Valley is pretty short so we were in and out within 30 mins or less. The",
          "About half an hour drive pout of town - named by no less than Neil Armstrong! Fascinating landscape with lots of walkways through and around it - wish we'd had more time. Don't be bullied into giving a tip to a musician you haven't asked to play for you!",
          "the Valley of the Moon is unusual geologically - sandstone worn by rain and wind - in a crater formed by glaciers and rivers. Yet it is high, so altitude sickness is a risk. We need some gentle exercise - and this was the place. Entry cost is modest and signage is adequate",
          "I will admit I did not know very much about La Paz before our visit, but this was so very interesting, and, I discovered, has been used as a movie set. If you go, the gifts shops only take cash (USD or Bolivianos), and you may wish to see if admission must also be paid in cash",
          "The valle de la luna or moon valley is a very unusual geologic formation during the glaciers, rain and wind erosion created its forms. Its a nice 45 minute walk. great for pictures, if you are lucky you will see some of the wildlife of the La Paz Valley: hummingbirds, some",
          "While in La Paz we decided to take a look at the Valley of the Moon or Valle de Luna as the locals call it. We booked a cab to take us ther (it's about 30 minutes outside of town depending on traffic), wait for us and bring us back. Round trip 150Bolivian (USD 22). Entrance fee",
          "45 minutes walk in a circular trails with many photo opportunity of the special and unique lime stone and clay formations. a very plesent way to pass an afternoon in La paz. as the city is packed with traffic jams, getting there by texi can take an hour from the touristic",
          "The Valley of the Moon is way down low in La Paz where most of the buildings are up on higher ground. It makes a pleasant walk through the unusual landscape as it can feel like you are really on the moon. Good for many unusual camera shots.",
          "Great geological formations to check out. 15 Bolivianos per person to enter. Not open on rainy days as this contributes to the erosion of the very formations you are heading out to see! You can do 15min loop and / or a 45min loop. We just did the 45min loop as we had limited",
          "We came here as part of a tour. However it rained on the day we visited and we were unable to walk around as it was deemed unsafe. We were allowed in part of it to take photos and it was incredibly slippery so I can understand why we couldn\u2019t walk all the way around. This place",
          "Located just outside La Paz, google to find the easy public transportation way to get there, it is a little bit like a different world. Well maintained you can stroll through this moon like landscape and if you choose your angle properly you even get pictures without",
          "We reached that place by public transportation (mini bus): just jump on a bus heading to \"Mallasa\" (read \"mayasa\") and enjoy your ride of 40mins. After 30 minutes ride we asked the driver to stop at the \"Parc de la Luna\", he called us when we had to leave, and we were right at",
          "I would like to think this once was a huge and beautiful landscape. Now only a small part of it survived (still looking nice), so you can take a walk of about 15 - 45 minutes. But the site is getting totally closed in by quite ugly buildings. We saw them flattening a large piece",
          "I booked this as a tour with Chacaltaya Mountain. But Barro Biking messed up with my booking so I wasn't able to join the tour. My efficient hostel manager advised me that I can take a mini-bus from San Francisco towards Mallasa. It cost me 2.60 Bob. The entrance is a mere 15",
          "Really hot in La Paz spring and we visited moon valley as part of Viator city tour plus Moonvalley. Unique view, natural and walkable paths but the weather was really too hot to do so. Can\u2019t really enjoy the tour. We have seen such view in capadocia but tour guide said it is not",
          "It was a bit of a hike to get out to (we went via taxi in the end) but the terrain was worth it. Super strange, it\u2019s quite an alien looking place. We took the 45 min trail which was lovely. We asked our taxi driver to come back for us (which he did happily).",
          "In La Paz, we got to Valley of the Moon by Teleferico and taxi. We really loved travelling by Teleferico, and it is so reasonably priced. You get great views and transport all in one. We took the Yellow Line and then the Green Line to get in the general area, and then took a",
          "One can see why this landscape was perfect for filming some of Starwars. It is haunting, errie and spectacularly beautiful. There are well marked trails for hiking. Take sunscreen, a hat, walking sticks and water. We spent about an hour, but could have easily remained for",
          "We visited Valley of the Moon with a tour guide who walked us around the park for around an hour telling us about the history. It was interesting and a great landscape. There are some people trying to sell things/busk so take coins if you want to partake in those things.",
          "The landscape was incredible. It was made more amazing by the fact that it was a relatively short and cheap cab ride from the La Paz city center. We were told that per Neil Armstrong, this landscape is one that most closely resembles that of the moon on Earth.",
          "Getting to the Valle de la Luna was difficult, is it just a matter of waiting so be prepared to wait in the sun. It's just how it is though. Once you're there is it really cool. Can get the bus (43, 902 or 273) for 3BOB each and entrance to the Valle del la Luna is 15BOB.",
          "Our visit to Valle de la Luna is a very memorable one. The views are spectacular. Be sure to bring your camera, and have enough time to do the longest of the two routes (I think that one was estimated to about 45 minutes). We had an arrangement with a taxi driver to wait for us,",

          "We went there with a taxi from the La Paz city center. It was a bright sunny day and the rock formations were showing in a wonderful light (great for pictures). The walk through the Moon Valley takes about 45 min to 1 hour, depending on how much time you take. It wasn't very",

          "Nice place but wasn\u2019t anything special. If you have a day spare you can visit it as it\u2019s a 400 bolivianos taxi from the center but I wouldn\u2019t prioritize it.",
          "Pros: 15b entrance 2.5b bus available from main square Interesting to see and good way to pass half the day Cons: All buses are full for the return journey, 40s taxi needed Set next to normal housing neighbourhood so loses its natural charm due to surroundings",
          "Loved my 50 minute trek here. There is an entrance fee of 15b. The view was really nice, and the place was really properly planned. The hike was easy due to the good condition of the roads. It was an easy hike even if u take the 45 mins hike vs 15min one. Would recommend here if",
          "This is an awesome spot, just a cab ride from our La Paz hotel. The driver even agreed to come back and pick us up, and he was thoughtful enough to arrive early when he saw it was starting to rain. A fascinating place. Not of this Earth lol.",
          "Unreal place sole 12km away from la paz CBD. You can go with a collectivo (3bob) or via a taxi (6bob). The entrance is 15BOB... nice location.",
          "We did a tour on a quad bike there and I did not liked it. I was concentrating on the driving (most of the time in streets with other cars) and not on the view. We stoped twice on the way to look at the view but it wasn't enough for me.",

          "Really enjoyed this location and being able to wander around amongst all the different shapes set very close to each other. There are 2 walks, one about 15 mins and the other 45 mins to 1 hour. Make sure you visit some of the artisan shops near the entrance.",
          "If you are interested in natural landscape, then Valle de la Luna is a wonderful place for a short(2 hours to half day) excursion from the city. It is easy to get there and tour around on your own. My friend and I went there by taking a mini-bus (going to Mallassa, 4 BOB, 30",

          "The landscape is very interesting and has an eary feel to it, that is how strange it is. It is basically in the city and a short excursion so do visit it when you are in La Paz.",
          "We took a micro bus from La Paz which was easy and cheap. It was a great drive as it gave us a chance to see other parts of the city. The valley itself is really cool and has awesome rock formations. If you have time to kill, this is worth a trip.",
          "We went by the city bus. We had a stop at the valley for ca. 30 min. For us it was enough time to enjoy the amazing view over the valley. With more time you could go different ways through the valley.",

          "An OK place to visit. The site is not well policed with many people walking off the designated paths and destroying the surrounding features. There's some good photo opportunities of the landscape.",
          "We visited on quad bike and the valley does have some impressive rock formations. But it\u2019s not a must see. If you\u2019ve travelled elsewhere in Bolivia there are far more impressive and cost efficient attractions in the south.",
          "Moon Valley was just two miles from our hotel. It is a highly dissected area of a muddy siltstone conglomerate. It simply couldn't be built on so it has been set aside and now has a gift shop that might be open or not, restrooms, and trails. It's really stunning to walk through",
          "This place is more than amazing!!!!! There wasn\u2019t a lot of people visiting it which made it more fun and i was able to take as many picture as I wanted. Loved it !!! Make sure to visit this place!! Its very cheap to enter but also very cheap to get there from the city.",

          "Only 40minutes outside of La Paz so well worth a visit. You can do the walk quickly, 20 mins, or stroll for about an hour on the longer route. If you keep your eyes open you may be lucky enough to see some wildlife inc. Vizcachas (like large rabbits). The formations are clay",

          "I read a review that explained the public bus route but really glad I shared a cab as the journey was 45 minutes away from our hotel (10km). The cab cost 100 Bolivianos for a return journey. Entry fee is 15 Bolivianos so approximately \u00a31.50 GBP. There was a 15 or 45 minute",
          "Reminds me of Bryce Canyon in Utah but with grey and black colored rock formations. Nice view from the top. Little dangerous as people can push you off the cliff.",
          "Quite a difference to be there - generally as to be on the moon. It is a short travel away fro La Paz. Could be made by taxi or public cab. Significant site for la Paz, as it hasn't lot to offer.",
          "This spot is just 30/45 minutes outside of La Paz. Super easy to get to, just take a collective going in the direction of Mallasa, cost 2.60 bolivianos. The collectivo will drop you off right at the entrance. The entrance is 15 bolivianos and takes about 1 hour if you walk",
          "I had a great time visiting this amazing rock formation. It was a bit difficult to get there but it was worthy. I hadn\u00b4t seen anything similar before. I recommend it",

          "I know you can get here by yourself on public transport, but I did an organised tour. The cost was quite small and it was much easier being in a \"van\" than trying to figure it out for yourself. The landscape is incredible. The 40 min path was quite easy to navigate despite the",
          "We spent about 20minutes at Moon Valley. The clay and basalt structures are interesting and, in some cases amazing. You can do walks of different lengths at the site. A good thing to do on a trip around La Paz.",

          "Valley of the Moon is like walking into another planet. The landscape is surreal and alien like. It is a must see to believe it. You can spend an easy hour or two walking around admiring all the different formations. Follow my #30somethinggapyear on Instagram",
          "Pros: This place is beautiful, unique and very inexpensive. You can talk a long walk (45 min) or a short walk (15 min) - both are self guided. I loved the little look outs and view points along the way. You might also meet a flute player who is sweet and charming and will try",
          "Oftentimes, this is combined with the Chacaltaya climb. Does not really make any sense, as one is north of the city and the valley south of it. The drive through the city takes a good 2-3 hours. The valley itself is does provide some nice sandstone formations, but the site is",
          "A beautiful landscape with weird shapes of rocks. Definitely a nice day trip you can do on your own.",

          "Fascinating geological feature, nice walk through a unique natural feature. It\u2019s easily accessible from the downtown. Don\u2019t miss Mario Sarabia\u2019s pottery studio nearby. He uses the raw material from the Valley to create his art.",
          "The Moon Valley in La Paz is very close to the city of La Paz, about 20 min. by car going south of the city direction to Mallasa. This is a geological formation by erosion due to wind, rain and time. We got there by minibus one from the central part to Obrajes plaza Humboldt",

          "The valley of the moon is a geological oddity created by erosion. Composed of clay and sandstone which the elements have whittled down to spires and ravines with other minerals adding colors of tan, red, and voilet. The site offers trails of two lengths which are 15 and 45",
          "Its a bunch of eroded hills with a subterranean entrance that did not do a thing for me. It is sort on unusual but the steps are poorly maintained and it just sort of weird.",

          "There are Colectivo's that will take you right from San FranciscoPlaza to the site, it is worth going, very strange rock/dirt formations. Colectivo's can take you back to the city and you can get off close to the start of the cable car line and take it to eL Alto.",
          "If you like moon views and walking, this is the place to visit! Go with clothes and confy shoes! a great hat is a must do! You can walk the entire place in 1-2 hours! Better go on a sunny day! Take some pics, you will think you are on the moon! Visits are during the day!",
          "Some guidebooks are definitely unkind about the Valley of the Moon. It\u2019s certainly an otherworldly rock formation that is unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen before. From the road it doesn\u2019t look like much but the main walk with photo stops can take around 50 minutes if you don\u2019t",
          "Interesting natural phenomenon. Lots of crevasses, caves and rocks to climb with stunning panoramic views at the top, overlooking the valley. There are also sand dunes here, would recommend wearing good walking shoes (not flip-flops/sandals). We picked a tour later on in the",

          "Made of clay this park erodes each rainy season and according to our guide will one day disapear. Made of clay it has mounds from the ground that replicate the appearance of the moon. At 3000m it is much lower than La Paz anx also warmer.",

          "This is an easy 2 hour excursion from La Paz. No need for a tour, can get there easily by taxi (and likely bus from Zona Sur). Two trails, one 45 minutes one 15. Worth a visit. to see the cool rock formations. Not at all wilderness though, it\u00b4s surrounded by population",
          "You can't miss it! Being in La Paz and not going to the Valley of the Moon is like going to a Pizza restaurant and not eat pizza. It's a close ride from the city and will not take you more than 2 hours to walk around and enjoy this extra terrestrial scenery.",

          "I spent about an hour here and covered the longer trail. There is a number of view points to take some good photographs, however, unless you are a geology geek you may find that walking through the landscape becomes somewhat tedious? If you have only a day in La Paz, I would",

          "This place is amazing, worth a visit to get some cool pictures. It's around half an hour drive from centre of La paz. There is a lovely camping village about 2 miles from it, if you want to stay in the area overnight.",
          "The valley is an interesting set of various mud sculptures made by the rain and the wind. There are trails that one can follow to see some of the most interesting shapes. Nothing extraordinary in my opinion.",
          "This place is not worth your time or money getting to. It's surrounded by city and feels like a child's amusement park. Go see valle de la animas for much more impressive formations and it's free (at least for now).",

          "The site offers 15 minutes and 45 minutes hike. Of course, there is no limit on time you can spend there. There are nice viewpoints convenient for taking pictures. There is a store where you can buy nicely designed souvenir t-shirts cheaper than in La Paz market. I was not",

          "Sure it is original but first, the place smells like a poney stable and second, it's not special enough to go all the way to this place",
          "Visited in early July 2017 as part of a La Paz city tour solely for me. It is just a short drive from the city and is worthwhile but wear suitable shoes, and you need a head for heights. Ideal for photographers as the sun is going down to capture those shadowy visions.",
          "This is a relatively unique place as it resembles some kind of Star Wars film set and it is in La Paz city just South of the city centre.about one hour and a half to explore and overall it is one of the top things to do in my opinion if you are in La Paz",
          "You do not see this just any where, so do NOT miss it. A quick ride from the city by taxi. Paths are marked. Easy climb. Glad they made it a small park.",
          "Interesting landscape. Be sure to find out when it was discovered, and how....then let your climate change opponant friends know! Also find out about the connection to Neil Armstrong. I agree with Gary M, it's not safe for young children, also the elderly, or those not 100%",
          "Valle de la Luna/Moon Valley was smaller than we expected & now being built up and around so seems to have lost some of the raw beauty it must have had. Very busy on a Sunday with families visiting - between noisy families & the nearby gun range?/perhaps they were clearing on",

          "This attraction has some interesting geological features (severe erosion in the soft rock), and is a pleasant walk around, if only to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. Entry is quite reasonable, and you are left to wander the site by yourself. I would warn travelers",
          "Valle de la Luna is surprisingly close to the city center of La Paz. It's an OK place to go if you have 2 to 3 hours of extra time. This is nowhere close to a 'must see' in La Paz, but then again, La Paz is not a place with any 'must see' attractions. I enjoyed my stay in La",

          "Your view on the place will be dictated by previous experiences. It is no Bryce Canyon or Kunming Stone Forest, but if you haven't seen them it is an interesting place to spend an hour. It is a relaxing place to walk - the paths are generally good - or just sit and soak up the",

          "I highly recommend you go and see Valle de la Luna. We were originally going to bike it on our own but when we went with a tour group we realised we would have missed a lot of the cool sites and we would have been exhausted doing from biking in a higher altitude from what we are",
          "nice and easy hike so that altitude doesn't affect you too much. Views are amazing and the price is ok.",
          "I was visiting La Paz and this site is only 1 hour away by cab. I believe you can go by public transportation or Trufi as well, but since it was our first day and only 100 boliviani for the round trip, we jumped in the cab. The driver waited for us at the parking lot. I felt",
          "A decent stop if you have a little bit longer in La Paz. Very easy to get to by local buses and cheap. If you see a guy playing on the windpipes and, like me, it makes you feel you are in the middle of a Western (in a good way) don't forget to tip him like I did. He leaves his",
          "I travelled to the Valle de la Luna as part of a small tour group. It is an amazing place situated about 30 min drive out of the heart of La Paz. You are treated to interested formations, with surreal views. There are many routes that can be taken around the venue so I would",
          "30 minutes out of town, small but nice walk. Take care because it was hard to find transport back to town",
          "With urban development the town has reach this site so what was once a nice place out of town is now a over populated this average site. Just lool at the pictures",
          "Valle de la Luna is a beautiful nature park located a short drive from downtown La Paz. It is comprised of various paths weaving through a truly unique landscape of natural spires of soil and stone spires. The only thing like it in the world that I've seen in Bryce Canyon in the",
          "Nice views and great trekkings, it is a very nice and cheap trip to do in La Paz and you won\u00b4t regret being there. Very recommended for a 3 hour trip and you don't expend more than a 100 pesos Bolivianos including entrance and taxi rides.",
          "There are so many other places more beautiful than this in Bolivia! If you are only in La Paz for a short period of time and will not go anywhere else in Bolivia, then do it.",
          "Valle de la Luna is a maze of canyons and giant spires. The formations, composed mainly of clay and sandstone, were created by the persistent erosion of mountains by the area\u2019s strong winds and rains. What remains is a surrealistic setting, full of wonder.There are two circular",
          "There is something with the moon valley that gives me a lot of peace. There are apparently two paths, a 15 minutes one and another of around, 45 minutes but I enjoyed the former and took almost 2 hours. The ticket was 15 pesos and it is easy to arrive there, but it would be best",
          "In the south part of La Paz City, this landscape is an interesting site to discover very nice views. The silence and the sightseeing makes it worth visiting.",
          "Very interesting landscape just outside of la Paz. About a 40 minute taxi ride for around 60 Bs. Or you can bus and cabke car. Cool to see if you have a couple hours to kill! Makes for great pictures.",
          "Relatively close to La Paz, this was a very cool stop. Take your time look at this interesting geographical landscape and just drink in the contrasts of the red mountains around. Do it!",
          "We visited the Moon Valley after lunch on day 2 in La Paz. It is very interesting to see the different shapes that the erosion has left behind but access is limited because movement about the area will cause even greater erosion. There are some nice views from the high points",
          "Easy to get to and worth the visit. Spires and domes of odd colored clay that overlooks the red and brown mountains make for an great landscape. You can walk through the place in about 15 minutes and they have put some steps in so its easy to get up and down. The colors are",
          "The place is very interesting. I took a local bus from La Paz Centro and it took me about 40 mins. You should leave after the rush hour! There should be 273 bus but I could not find the bus number so I took 271 instead from Mexico street. This place is all so interesting!",
          "Although the area is quite large the track does not take long to walk. It is interesting to see the erosion that has taken place and see how they were reclaiming the area, although that has now stopped. You can also look back and get a good view of the city f La Paz from here",
          "This city will disappear if they don't plant some trees, my city is green all year around and here everything is brown with a few trees. This place shows what is going to happen in the future with this place. I got choked !!",
          "Enjoyed our short visit here. It does not takes long to walk the tracks as it doesnt cover a very big area. Was very interesting though and worth seeing",
          "This \"park\" has two trails through the rock formations, a 15min and a 45min one. If you're driving all the way here, I suggest the 45min trail, though it can be easily done in 30min. The trail, however, is falling apart in places because of the rain (making the path almost too",
          "Moon valley is a small exhibition for interesting natural rock sculptures. It is only 15 BOB to enter and 2.50 BOB each way on the bus to get there, or you can take the teleferico and then a bus - a more enjoyable way!",
          "It's a bunch of erosion effected mud that sort of looks like moonscape. Only problem is you are still surrounded by urban sprawl, so its a bit hard to indulge in the fantasy. It's really hard to breathe due to La Paz's altitude, so thats kind of like the moon. It only costs $7",
          "A very unique location that is not commonly found. We had great photos here. Suggest to spend more than 1 hour to walk to various part/paths.",
          "Valle de la Luna is gorgeous, well thought out and sympathetic walking path - don't come here thinking it's a hike - with a lovely meandering path through the area. The journey up very pretty as well. We just did this all super cheap on public transport Colectivo there - get",
          "Eventhough colour range of the landscapes is contrary to local fabrics, scarce and limited by sandy to grey, with scattered green of cactus and equisetum, the whole scenery gives you very intense aesthetic pleasure to behold. It is certainly worth of a taxi trip, a few miles",
          "It doesn't take a long time to see everything so it is quite a long way out of town for a short experience. It is however very interesting and beautiful and worth the trip. You should be careful when you walk around. There isn't the same level of health and safety as in the UK.",
          "We visited this unique place for an hour or so. The erosion of the land creates an interesting view worth the walk. We did the 45 min circle and enjoyed it very much. It was not crowded but there were others on the trail. This would be difficult for those with mobility issues",
          "Beautiful place, worth to visit. U need only couple of hours. Take a van from plaza san Francisco that goes to mallasa. (Small city right after moon valley). It costs around 4bs one way. Tell the driver u are going to valley de la luna, he will stop there. Entrance is about 15bs",
          "We took the minibus \"collectivo\" from plaza San Francisco to Mallasa (small village right next to the valley of the moon) for around 4 bolivianos each one way and we asked the driver to drop us off at the moon valley and he stopped right in front of the entrance. The entrance",
          "Interesting is the word I would use to describe this site. I'm still not sure what it was? There was no information in Spanish or English but it was great to see so unusual especially in the city. I will have to look up some information later. We paid a taxi 150bs to take us",
          "There are lots of beautiful geological formations around La Paz but this is one of the easiest to access and it is full of crazy shapes so I'd definitely recommend a visit. We spent around 1 hour at a pretty slow pace so we could enjoy the landscape, but if you don't have much",
          "I would not recommend you to go there. I did not find anything special to see or do there. I went there because the price was the same if we went there or not. You can buy it as a package together with the trip to Chacaltaya. But a green park that was close to this attraction",
          "Cool scenery, not a long activity but great to wander and take photos for an hour. Just manage expectations! Easy and in our experience perfectly safe to get there without a tour, 4B each way on the yellow micro collectivo/bus that comes down the Main Street to San Francisco",
          "Good for one time visit. I took a tour. It is very different experience. It will take 1-2 hr max. Enjoy it.",
          "One of the things that made this trip special is that was an native guy playing the charango over a mountain in the Moon Valley. The walking with the music on the background make a difference. We went on the 15 minute track and we finish it in 7 minutes, so if you got time get",
          "This was ok for an extra of a different tour I was doing. I personally wouldn't bother wasting my time by visiting alone or paying for a tour just do visit",
          "A nice place to go if you are visiting La Paz, at some point you really feel like in another planet. It's a short visit, so it won't take more than half of your day.",
          "It's a nice to see place and the walking path is well maintained. I went with the bus tour from La Paz and they officially only give you 20 minutes to see the Valley. At the end we stayed nearly 45 minutes but that didn't help for people who were back on time. So if you go",
          "Located outside the city it might not be worth the effort to get there. The formations are pretty cool but it's only a 45 minute walking loop. If you do go, take the local bus (vans) to get there. Mallasa or Jupapina.",
          "It's a nice place to see something different and un common, it doesn't take too much time, it's just 45min to see everything.",
          "We went as part of a city tour. Interesting landscape. Toilets, described on the sign as hygienic, had no water to refill the bowl or to wash your hands (son had diarrhea)",
          "On December 31, 2016, I visited Moon Valley, and then did quad biking around the area. It was worth the entrance fee, and the quad biking also was worth it. My tour guide was a great photographer too, which added to the enjoyable experience.",
          "A nice day trip if you are staying nearby in Jupapina like we were. But if you are coming from La Paz then I don't think it's totally worth it. The bus journey from La Paz provides just as good views.",
          "Check it out if you are in La Paz. Definitely worth a visit. We did this as a part of a trip to Chacaltaya, but you can also get here by bus from La Paz.",
          "We went by the sightseeing bus so we only had a 15 minute stop. For us, it was enough. It tend to be very hot in la Valle de la Luna on a sunny day.",
          "This is a themepark version of a natural formation and much smaller than you would assume. Not worth the time, effort or money of getting there from La Paz. Spend your time and money elsewhere.",
          "Small but pretty geological site, nice for a half hour's walk. Beautiful rock formations, beware though as some of the ground is unstable. There is nowhere to buy water here so bring your own.",
          "This place is absolutely amazing. It looks like the pictures of the moon itself. Although some days is a little bit packed because it's very touristic, it is a must go if you visit la Paz. Great places to take good pictures. Go with comfortable shoes and be ready to take of and",
          "It is a fair way out of town , we got there by the cable car then a taxi at the end station . Strange landscape that lives up to its name , lots of photo opps",
          "It's ok. If you ahve time to spare. Sure. You can walk around in 15-30 minutes. The formations are cool but not magnificent.",
          "Unless this is already part of your tour- not really worth a special trip to see. Small area of \"Badlands\" type of rock formations , which you can walk around in about half an hour.",
          "Definately worth visiting! Beautiful and peaceful place. Views are amazing. Don't forget the hat because sun is very strong there.",
          "A great place to have the moon-feeling of the Andes! We loved walking through the area or to stop and sit and be silent. It is in the south of la Paz and you can spend between half an hour or 3h .... If you have some extra time in La Paz: go and enjoy!",
          "I took a combi for 2.6 bs. to get there. The entrance fee is 15 bs. You do not need a tour guy. There are 2 options when you get in: a 15 minutes hike or a 45 minutes. I did the longest, I loved it!! Very easy to hike...Nobody was there so it was very peaceful, the view is soo",
          "I really enjoyed the visit here. the views were amazing and the valley was great to walk around it passed a lovely hour and is well worth the visit.",
          "Surrealistic landscaping.I agree with Mr.Armstong to describe it as a Lunar valley.Well connected with bus. To be honest I was expecting something larger and a bit more loooked after. But was a great experience.",
          "easy to get too. Really cool way to spend an hour climbing around on weird rocks and looking a cool rodents and plant life.",
          "This is for you if you like rocks. This park is a main attraction for tourists. It displays how the weather and elements have formed this valley of all kinds of structures. The formations look like ones you would find in humid caves.",
          "If you are in La Paz a few days it's fine to go a couple of hours. Moon landscape, nice walk, nothing special.",
          "It is just stunning. Beautiful stone jungle with amazing view of the whole city. It is a bit hard with the transportation. We had a hard time finding the taxi back to the city center. Not even expecting any buses or so. But the place is definitely worth visiting.",
          "I note that most reviewers use the term \"interesting\", which indicates \"waste of time\". It is indeed a dry lunar landscape, surrounded by the city's housing. Visit 10 minutes if you must.",
          "This is a great place to visit. The clay formations are incredible - even a little eerie. It is well marked out with paths and steps on gentle slopes which makes it easier for those feeling the altitude. Very different from most tourist destinations. I loved it",
          "Valle de la Luna is a nice place to visit when you have 2 or 3 days in La Paz. You can visit the site in 3 different ways: the first one is a tour that also includes 'Chacaltaya' (a ski resort at 5300m), by taxi or by (mini)bus. We chose the latter of the 3 options. From the big",
          "Did a tour when Diana tours. The information given be guide was very basic but the views speak for themselves. Beautiful!",
          "Either a 15 minute or 45 minute walk through a lunar landscape inhabited by rabbits. Very little vegetation just cacti. A peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of La Paz. Our guide could not explain how the landscape was formed but it was unique.",
          "Heard about this place has always thought big and wild place. The place is located almost in the city center, a small place with lots of tourists. If there is something more important to do, can be dispensed with.",
          "This is a natural formation and a very unusual and unique one situated in the south lower end of La Paz in a residential area Yes, the formations are impressive but most of The Valley was encroached by and used for high end housing , so the view is really limited I cannot give",
          "Very different topography to the rest of La Paz hence the name. If you are in the area then it's worth a visit - there are a couple of paths that lead you around up and down. The path is quite steep and narrow in places.",
          "Too far , not good, after salar of uyuni, this place is boring taxi is a way to go and to return the bus takes you to city center",
          "Valle de la Luna is like you are on the moon, due to the dirt formations: makes it for a nice and unique day trip, by minibus.",
          "It was a nice ride, but not so impressive. It is not mandatory to do it with a guide! You can just take a bus and do it yourself.",
          "It's not a legend: the first man on the moon name this place \"Valle de la Luna\" whilst he was playing at the golf court nearby. Well worthy a visit :-)",
          "nice sight but much smaller than you would expect, encompassed in urban developments this is something to do if you have lots of free time.",
          "This is close to the city to organise a visit with a taxi. The place is totally surreal with beautiful views. No need for a guide it's all well laid out footpaths around the site. We took the 45 minute walk and enjoyed it. Wanted to stay longer but we asked the taxi to wait for",
          "We went there as part of a tour and really enjoyed the 45 minutes walk in Valle de la Luna and the view of Devils Tooth. Entrance is 15 Bs for adults and 1 Bs for children. It is important to keep your kids under close supervision when visiting this place as there is plenty",
          "Valle de la Luna, aka Moon Valley, is an area where erosion has worn away the majority of a mountain in La Paz. At an altitude of 3299 MASL, the site is composed primarily of clay rather than rock, and tall spires are left making you think you truly are out of this world. A cool",
          "Neil Armstrong visited this place and said it looks like Moon Surface and hence this Valle de la Luna became tourist famous. Its Ok for one visit. You need to walk a lot with lot of stairs going up and down hence elderly people think before you buy a ticket to move around. Carry",
          "Its a fascinating walk in surrealistic scenery of rock formations and on clearly marked paths. No problem to do this on your own. We took a taxi from Lap Paz center - cost us 40 Bs. They placed a musician in local attire on the highest peak playing lovely flute music and it",
          "Good tour. Fries had good stops extra time at sunset. Left just as it got good though. Would recommend to others for the info. He was funny.",
          "What a place. Do the 45 minute walk around. It is worth taking time to explore the hidden treasures of this place; the many cactus varieties, pebbles precariously mixed within the 'dirt', the shy creatures that pop their heads out and the drop-offs that make you watch where you",
          "Interesting rock formations through out the park. Nice for a half day activity with family, friends or solo. At the entrance of the park there's some shops where you can find artwork by local artists. Worth visiting!",
          "Nice place to reach for an afternoon. Not expensive and easy to walk. Our tour did combine Moon Valley with Chacaltaya mountain that we did not expect to do but which was finally more impresive ! We take the tour from Loki Hostel : the guide was basic ... Minibus okay.",
          "We got a taxi to here and back to town meaning all in we ended up spending 150Bs (included the 15Bs admission for 2 people) in Canadian that works out to around $40. Definitely worth it. Landscape was awesome and in the afternoon you avoid it being such a touristy trap and you",
          "I was skeptical. I wasn't going to visit but decided to anyways. I'm so glad I did. Valle de la luna offered amazing views, and some \"unearth\" like geography! The landscape is surely one of a kind.",
          "It's 40 mins from La Paz, about 40-50 B$ taxi one way. Costs 15 B$ to get in. It's a marvel to wander around and take some cool shots of rocky landscapes. Do the 45 min route, you will see a lot more than the typical touristy 15 min route. Worth the trip for sure!",
          "Its a very different but interesting place! We went there for an hour and without sunglasses and sun hat it was a little bit to sunny to really enjoy full!",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to Valle De La Luna.. There are a lot of places to explore. I would suggest bringing water, sunblock and wearing comfortable shoes to explore the area. Plan on spending, at least 4 hours. You can choose to hike up some stairs and walk the perimeter.",
          "Very close to the city and easily accessible by any collectivo bus going to Mallasa, this place offers superb views and nice chance to escape from the city chaos. Entrance fee is 15 Bs for international travellers (no student discounts). Well-maintained park with 15 or 45 min",
          "We visited the moon valley as second part of our day tour. The moon valley was much easier to walk around in and amazing geographically. The walk took around an hour is should be done out of the days hot sun. Worth a visit!",
          "I was in La paz late last month into the early part of this month and did a few tours. After going to Chacalyta I vistited this place...moon valley. Really great experience for someone like me who usually travels alone. I met a swedish couple and week walked around for the",
          "I visited Moon Valley (or Valle de la Luna) as part of a day trip booked through Kanoo Tours (which also included a visit to Chacaltaya mountain for just $15 USD). It\u2019s located about 30 minutes South of the city centre &, although doesn\u2019t require a particularly long stay, is",
          "This was an included attraction as part of a packaged land tour. There was an entrance fee; but I'm not sure what it was, It is a neat place to visit; although nothing really special. It is definitely not handicapped accessible. The steps can be a little taxing as (keep in mind)",
          "We walked up from Colibri, and it was definitely cool to walk through - full disclaimer, we didn't get a guide - but I can't see someone going out of their way to see it. It's 15 bolivianos per person.",
          "Very interesting visit and for us a must see... Don't forget to take (or buy there) a bottle of water, sun glasses and a hat before you start the visit because altitude doesn't help and you will get tired very soon.",
          "This attraction is not far from the city of La Paz and it can be done in as little as 45 minutes. It is a beautiful landscpe,with some features which are just hard to imagine that actually do exist. There various points such as the 'Lady's hat', are features appearing on the",
          "First and foremost . . . HOLD ON TO YOUR KIDS!!! There are walk ways, but wow! Plenty of places for them to fall if you're not vigilant. It was nice, but after having visited the Badlands in the USA, this was nothing. I'd have given it a higher rating, but the low rating is",
          "This was an interesting place for the family to walk around and take pictures for an hour. It is strange how this place takes form and continues to change when it rains,",
          "This was my favorite experience in La Paz. It was amazing and totally unlike any other place I have visited. So much fun to walk around, great spot for fun photography. A must do experience. Be sure to take a good camera. The elevation maybe a problem for some and do take a",
          "Quite different to anything you've seen, a bit boring after a while since all the places have the same look.",
          "Not a great attraction but on a city tour it is worthy of a short visit, they are trying to encourage tourists and this is a historical part.",
          "We had a guided morning tour and were taken to Valle de la Luna. It was pretty cool but just something to have a quick visit. Not somewhere you'd hang around.",
          "Really easy to get to using a mini-bus (micro) or even a taxi. Very surreal landscape. Takes only a few hours to get there do the walking tour and get back to La Paz.",
          "I had half a day in La Paz and my host decided to take me to visit the moon valley landscape. It was a good choice. Close to La Paz and once there you will not believe that such a landscape could exist at such a high altitude but then geological explanations make it simple.",
          "We were staying out in this area, walking distant anyways, but I wouldn't definitely recommend this stop. Even as a day trip from La Paz I thought it was actually more worthwhile than Tiwanaku",
          "Amazing landscapes and crazy mountain forms! Seriously out of this world. A must do in La Paz, along with Teleferico and Dead Road.",
          "This is an interesting natural attraction with a unique landscape. Something you won't easily see elsewhere. It only takes about an hour to walk around it, so it makes for a good half day trip. No need to take a tour costing 40+ USD. Just get a taxi or public transport down to",
          "Valley of the Moon is worth the visit. Natural site that is quite interesting. Some shops in the tunnel as you enter the site. Great look at the surrounding hills and valleys as you traverse the various walking trails that provide an overlook to the area.",
          "We got a taxi from our hostel. It cost about 50 BOB each way. There is a bus but it is rather sporadic, tours are also expensive but shop around. We decided to walk around on our own and very much enjoyed ourselves- definately no need for a guide. Easily spent over and hour",
          "Interesting how this topography is similar with the Moon Valley in Chile but different colors. While Chile\u2019s red on contrast to the early, Bolivia\u2019s colors are more earthy and clayish. Both have cactus growing. If you take the double decker bus tour, you can take great photos",
          "a great way to adjust to altitude. you catch the teleferico to a lower altitude at 3200m and catch a 10 minute taxi to Val de Luna. was great to walk around this unusual attraction and not to taxing. the '45 minute' walk is more like 20 minutes.",
          "The landscape is great! you must take the long tour, not the short one. as long as you walk you will find some signs that tell you the figure you will see, it's a game for your mind, just great. As you have to walk do not go with babies, it's really tiring but totally worth it.",
          "Really Worth tour! Very interesting Rock Formations! It seems you outside the planet! Nice tourist structure too",
          "This is normally an attraction that follows Chacaltaya mountain. It is worth doing both. Valle de la Luna is in the city of La Paz, and offers a different scenario and excellent photo opportunities! If you have small children with you, make sure you hold them by the hand all",
          "We enjoyed Luna Valley & were happy we went given its proximity to the city, but wouldn't say it was a highlight of our trip so wouldn't prioritise it over other attractions",
          "First, consider visiting Falcon Valley on a way to Moon Valey. You will find interesting red rock formation there and great side view on La Paz. Moon Valley itself looks like great backery work in progress with piles of pancakes dough forming cones and other structures. Rocks",
          "It's an interesting rock/sand formation that you can see even from outside the park. A circuit of 45 min (which you can do in 20) or 15min (which you can probably do in 7). The entrance ticket is 15bs (around is$2.5) which is fine. If you have plenty of time in La Paz it's worth",
          "It is incredible and let us to think about th nature. You can get the Valle de la Luna by a classical tour with the Chacaltay Montain as well. You leave the city early to go to Chacaltaya and then you get the Valle de la Luna in the afternoon time, going back downtown La Paz in",
          "Valle de la Luna while a bit hard to navigate is incredible. The landscape is amazing! It is desolate and very much lives up to its name.",
          "We visited the morning of our very early arrival. It was an easy 20 minute ride from our hotel in la Zona Rosa. Admission was a few dollars and it is very cool to see. We were exhausted and didn't have much energy to hike around, but it would've been cool to do so. There is not",
          "We went to Valle de la Luna with low expectations having heard it was overly touristy and it is true. It's essentially a small portion of a valley set up with a gate for tourists and lots of trinkets for sale. For a real experience it is best to talk to locals and find some of",
          "Very different and beautiful place to visit. The 15 min walk is much shorter, 45 min walk is majestic.",
          "Really cool experience. This place feels like a smaller Bryce Canyon which others have mentioned before. Overall it's a beautiful place with stunning formations.. Only spoilt slightly by the residential areas surrounding it",
          "With gray rock formations and crevices, the Valley of the Moon is appropriately named. It's one of those places that, if you don't stop, you'll think you missed something. If you do stop, you'll ask, \"Why?\"",
          "A wonderful place to visit on a sunny day. We went on our own with a private car and spent a couple of hours walking around. It is an awesome place to visit but give yourself enough time if you have problems with the altitude. I did so I had to stops often to catch my breath.",
          "It is about 10 km from La Paz. Wear good hiking shoes, hat, and sunscreen.It is more like a maze of canyons. The formations are mostly composed of clay and sandstone created by erosion of mountains by the area's strong winds and rains. There are also several species of cactus",
          "We were on a city tour of La Paz and we suddenly arrived at this place (Moon Valley) which really does look like another planet. Great outcrops of stone, which have been eroded away to form, what look like stalagmites. Also has some interesting cacti.",
          "It is better than the mood, Neil Armstrong said. We felt the same way. Great place for photographers. We even had the luck to see strange desert animals, something like rabbits with long tails.",
          "It's well worth your while to go and check out the unusual a d lovely scenery at Valle de la Luna. Due to a public transport blockade we missed out on Valle de la Luna on our tour the day before. A lady at a tour agency told us it was uncertain if the blockade would continue so",
          "Take a taxi from La Paz and then rent an ATV for two hour trip to the miradors watching on the valle. Nice attraction for half a day.",
          "Awesome inexpensive activity to get out of the busy urban La Paz. I went on my own in a taxi and was a great little afternoon trip. Highly recommend it if you have extra time in La Paz.",
          "Don't need more than half an hour at this place. It is in the middle of the city and this destroys the impression.",
          "Not a common site seeing location, nature at its best. Make sure you have good shoes and plenty of water.",
          "I came expected to be hiking... This wasn't entirely my experience. Its a great place to go and take pictures, and you definitely do some walking, but other reviews called it a hike which frankly isn't true. From sopocachi, I took a cab for 40 Bs. It is accessible in minibuses,",
          "We visited the Valle de la Luna as part of a city bus tour & were surprised how close it was to the main city. We were given 20 mins to roam about and that was plenty of time to see the sights. Not a must see but not bad as part of a larger tour.",
          "It was a great experience. Requires some moderate walking through the valley. Only went on the 20 minute route although the whole circuit could get to be 45 minutes. Breathtaking.",
          "Totally worth the visit. .. your family back home won't believe the pictures! Take lots of water, as it is hot - and even a parasol - and the sun is probably always shining. I found the few shops near the entrance very interesting and well priced, having seen many similar",
          "The local tourist guide tolds us, that famous american astronaut Neil Armostrong visited this valley and told, that it\u00b4s looks like a surface on the Moon. Commercial for the tourist. But if you have time, you can visit it. I was.",
          "It is easy to get there, taking the local bus you get there in a hour. All stars in San Francisco square.",
          "Stopped off as part of a tour. This is an amazing peace of natural phenonima and worth a look. We stayed around 30 minutes but you can take the entire walk around the lunar landscape in around 3 hours. Great ice cream shop across the road......",
          "If we were just visiting Moon Valley you would probably give it 5 stars but when you have also spent several days on the salt flats and atacarma desert it is not so stunning. If you are in La Paz and have some time it is certainly worth a visit. If you do go then I would",
          "This place is amazing! Really cool landscape and nice tracks around. We caught a taxi from San Pedro square for about 50 and then made our way to the cable car for a scenic route back. Cheap entry and nice way to see more of La Paz",
          "Very odd place but also quite small and everything is the same. Sure, the place has some striking views but Im not sure Id spend the time going there again.",
          "You need to allow a couple of hours to explore the many paths through this lunar-like landscape. Very unusual, it has been compared to the \"badlands\" landscapes of Montana. Mostly clay hoodoo-like protuberances, some with imaginative names, it's a great place to spend a couple",
          "A very interesting place to see and to walk by, take pictures and enjoy in a very different environment near La Paz downtown.",
          "Valle dela Luna or Valley of the Moon, that's what they call it. A labyrinth of lunar-like surroundings that is definitely out of this world. The wonders of nature never fail to surprise me!",
          "Nice place but i wouldn't think you need to spend too much time here. It's really hot in the afternoons, so bring water and sunscreen and a cap. There's a slight smell in the air, but besides that, its ok!",
          "Is a realy boring tour. The place is realy interesting, but if you went to Chacaltaya before, you'll be realy tired when you arrive here.",
          "They charge 15 bs to get in, and there are two paths walk through the valley (15 or 45 minutes each, your call). The valley itself is beautiful; it looks like miniature mountains and there's pathways and vistas along it\u2013 very safe and easy to walk through. I really recommend it.",
          "Amazing landscape the likes of which I had not seen anywhere. A must on your visit to La Paz. We got there fairly early on a fabulous clear day and beat the crowds.",
          "Went here as part of a City Tour and was very pleased to have done so. It was uncrowded and the shorter walk around the site gave you a good idea of what life on the moon must be like. If it was good enough for Neil Armstrong it will be good enough for you. Great photo",
          "Worth a visit to see a lunar type landscape. ... there are 2 options a quick 15 min circuit or the longer 45 min. We did the latter and were reasonably impressed. 45 mins is plenty of time to see all. We (4 of us) arranged for a taxi to take us there and wait the hour before",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit the the Moon Valley. The landscape was interesting and did feel like a moonscape in the city. There are 2 circuits that can be followed: a 15 minute one and a 45 minute one (that takes about 30 minutes if you walk briskly). There are gift shops on",
          "It's about a 20 minute cab ride from Plaza San Pedro. It really looks like a moonscape in side of the city. They have 2 trails- 15 minutes and 45 minutes but it takes slightly less time. Great place for photos.",
          "Very surreal and uplifting experience! It's like nothing you have ever experienced earlier no matter how much you travel (I've traveled a lot). It's also very safe with security guards and clean and well maintained which is a big plus for me. Five stars! *****",
          "An interesting place to visit, but not a must see when in La Paz. To be fair whilst on a tour we were pushed for time, but I cannot see how more than 30 mins is required here",
          "You need to manage your expectations when going. You will need some water, some good walking/hiking shoes and ready for some stairs and light climbing. Also remember the bathroom will have little or no tissue. Seeing many rock formations in Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and even",
          "An amazing location right in La Paz. You can get there by local bus but taxi's are not expensive and yes they are quicker. The landscape is impossible to describe. Moonscape? Pretty close. They have added traditional dressed musicians standing on rock pinnacles playing flutes to",
          "It's for sure a nice place, but nothing special. Go with the public bus from La Paz for 2-3 Bolivianos. Entrance fee is 15 Bolivianos.",
          "Offers a lunar view as we would imagine it to be. Very special and worth the trip. Takes 45 min from La Paz.",
          "Bolivia boasts landscapes like nowhere else on Earth, and Valle de la Luna is no exception. The story goes that this place used to be called Valley of the Spirits, until Neil Armstrong (visiting Bolivia as he'd seen the salt flats from space and made a point of visiting upon his",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this interesting and unique landscape. The paths are easy to follow. The only downside is that the development that is encroaching on the site detracts from the natural beauty of the spot. Overall worth a visit.",
          "You will never be able to visit a place like this..... Valley of the Moon is a unique experience for anyone visiting La Paz. You feel as if you are really on what we know of what the moon looks like.... Recommended 100%",
          "An interesting site, very popular in La Paz. It is a natural site full of eroded pieces of land. You can see some columns looking parts consisting of sandstone sand and again sandstone which proves thousands of year ago the area was covered by water. The formations are very",
          "This place is very unlikely so close to La Paz but it was very interesting to see and the Age of the valley is impressive",
          "Our group took a tour of the Valley of the Moon one afternoon and everyone loved it. The landscape is very unique and beautiful in a strange way. It's worth seeing if you're in La Paz.",
          "Moon valley was nice itself to walk around. But the staff was so unwelcoming not letting us in around 4pm because the staff finishes at 6pm the lady at the office was very rude",
          "Visited here as part of the city tour, it was our first stop. Lovely walk around the moonscape, lots of twists and turns some nice views. Went in the morning before the sun got too hot as there is no shade.",
          "A collection of hoodoos just outside of La Paz. We enjoyed it in the morning mid week and only enountered a few other people. A cholita caretaker happily posed with us for pictures, even insisting we wear her bowler hat. Be careful not to drop anything as there's no going",
          "We booked a 4PM sunset tour of the Valley de la Luna through Whipala Tours. The entrance of the Valley costs 3000CHP (2500CHP for students). The views are spectacular everywhere and look more like Mars than the Moon. We started with a walk through a salt cave, then hiked an hour",
          "Just a 10km ride from the centre of La Paz lies The Valley of the Moons, a unique landscape formed by the wind. The monoliths are made from sandstone and have been eroded over centuries from the strong winds. Really a bit like on the moon. There are lots of little canyons and",
          "We did Chacaltaya and Valle de la Luna together for about 60 Boliva each (a bargain at current rates) and this is one of the regular day trips offered by most tour companies and found it more fun and interesting than doing as part of a city tour. We did the Red Cap tour for our",
          "This was part of our city tour and do we did only as short visite. Loved it and interesting to take some pictures. If you have more time you can do a full tour and I suppose this might take 2 hours all depending on how quick/slow you ant to walk. It is hot with little shade so",
          "Unique valley with sand sculptures carved by the wind and rain, the area is very similar to the Cappodocia region of Turkey. ** somewhat inaccessible. Washrooms and shops are down a flight of stairs.",
          "Good place if you like a walk between some strange rock formations. Actually there are some really nice similar rock formations further down along the river in a more natural and grander environment, where you do not have to pay an entrance fee. I go there a lot to walk. Never",
          "This was okay for a couple of hours (max). It was a faff to get to and underwhelming when we got there. Don't get me wrong, it was really cool and interesting to see but I think we expected more. Worth doing if you have spare time in La Paz but don't be overly worried if you",
          "The valley of the moon was a very interesting area of rock/sand/clay formations. We were told the area is eroding and will be gone in another 80-100 years. It does not take long to view the area but it is well worth the trip.",
          "An awesome natural wonder.... And source of exercise! One of the most impressive things is the sheer size. Until you get amongst it you don't get an idea of the scale. It's a mad place.... And I'm not joking about hide and seek either! Let your hair down and try it! You'll need",
          "Only 30 minutes drive from La Paz, Moon Valley is really like walking on another planet - the name was given by Neil Armstrong, and he should know !",
          "So, so great! I felt like I just stepped into a Star Trek episode. It is so different and beautiful, a must see in La Paz. Definitely a rare beauty, go check it out! Easy to get there only takes one bus if you are visiting Zona Sur.",
          "Its like standing in a desert with artistic sand expression - its truly god gifted natural formation. Littel away fro la Paz but certainly worth a visit.",
          "A short escorted tour from downtown La Paz and I was wandering through this strange landscape, carved by the wind and rain over thousands of years in soaring temperatures . Worth a morning or afternoon if time permits while visiting La Paz.",
          "This is an interesting place to go if you're in La Paz, but if you've seen other badlands (e.g. Badlands National Park, Theodore Roosevelt NP) you may be underwhelmed. When I went, there seemed to be a pervasive smell of garbage. Regardless, the trip down is interesting to see",
          "If you visit La Paz city, please spend some time at Valle de la Luna and feel yourself as walking on the moon ;)",
          "Amazing place. Fantastic views. Definitely worth a half day trip and with a tour group so you learn much more :)",
          "I'll be honest, I didn't get a guide when I went here so I'm still clueless as to how this place was formed. That said, just wandering around for an hour or so was a nice, cheap way to spend an afternoon. This place can be accessed by bus from the city for just 2 bolivianos. I",
          "This was the second half of a full day tour that started with visiting Chalcantaya ski resort. The landscape was interesting and I got some cool photos, but it was underwhelming. I had expected a much larger area than there was. Everywhere from moon valley you could see",
          "It's a must when you are in La Paz. Amazing different a little bit tiring :) interesting geographic formations.",
          "Valle de la Luna is a place full of interesting geographic formations .... While formations like these are commonplace - to an extent , what makes it interesting is the scale and how big the area is. The surrounding areas also look interesting , in reds and others colors. A",
          "Went on a date here with my gal...wonderfully fun and relaxing and worth it. Easy to do in an afternoon and by yourself or with a group (even a big one).",
          "This place was amazing and worth a day out to or even 1/2 a day Easy to get to and the place is very interesting with amazing out of this world scenery I was in town on business but as my hotel couldn't supply basic wifi in my room , I was forced outside to enjoy the sites",
          "I did the trip for 25 bolivianos by using local transport. I caught a bus with Mallasi as the destination close to San Francisco. I asked the driver to tell me when we got to the right place. The colours of the rocks are beautiful and there is a path that takes 45 minutes",
          "Nice place to go although not exciting. Good to spend an hour if you have nothing else to do. We had it as part of our day tour.",
          "Relaxing walking tour for families and friends. Awesome to take pictures of incredible sights. It really looks as if you are on the moon.",
          "Pleasant walk among bazar scenery with boulder mounted on narrow clay and sand pinnacles. Very nice walk to take with a small group after a noon meal that can be enjoyed at a local caf\u00e9. Best to tie in with a tour of city. Not a hard walk at all once accustom to the altitude.",
          "Just on the outskirts of La Paz there is a park called Valley of the Moon. You can get there by taxi and we are told they will wait up to one hour for you to explore for 80 bolivianos. We just took the hop on hop off bus and they let us out for 20 minutes to take photos. It was",
          "You can visit Moon Valley on a city tour or combine with e.g. visit to Chalcataya. Amazing landscape, best if the weather is good. Need approx 1 hour here. Plenty of great photo opportunities. Complete contrast to what you see in La Paz - was not expecting this on the edge of a",
          "It was our privilege to visit this area prior to our reluctant departure from La Paz. The rovk formations remind me a little of Bryce Canyon in Utah, USA. It is definitely worth an hour of your time when you are visiting La Paz",
          "This was a very enjoyable stop on a tour of La Paz. Outside the central city area, it is reminiscent of Capadoccia in Turkey, with natural spires and jagged formations formed by erosion. Not the kind of topography you might expect in an area surrounded by towering mountains,",
          "One of the attractions here in La Paz, an incredible set of naturally sculptured sand stone which has resulted in a surreal setting.",
          "The place is not so atractive to me. But it's a good place to kill some times when you are free in La Paz since it takes around 40 minutes to get there. The place is well organized.",
          "An easy walk through some fascinating surreal landscape right in La Paz . At the highest point ---not very high-- there can be some strong winds. So if you take children on the walk, hold their hands. We had a good buffet lunch at a restaurant (we think in the Belevedere",
          "This place was very interesting to visit as the landscape is so different from the rest of the area around La Paz. The trails are easy to navigate and there are great views from here. There are also some little shops with that carry local crafts and art work here.",
          "Went there with a small group and walked several of the paths. Very interesting rock formations easily accessed by several paths of differing difficulty, but none too hard. Some of the views were spectacular.",
          "I came here back in 2010 and found it very interesting. From what I recall they had like 2 or 3 different paths you can take. There were some parts of the path that seemed somewhat dicey to walk on but that just made it more exciting to walk through. Although its not a place",
          "It is a great place to escape from the La Paz, something that you would not expect in the middle of such city. It is really good organized with city bus tour as it stops there for 20' so you can have time to enjoy it and then get back to the bus!",
          "The valley is located just out side of La Paz. It has interesting rock formations. Takes a little less than an hour to hike through the site. If you have some free time it is worth a visit.",
          "Nice place, but they have to learn how to became a touristic point the little roads must be fixed to be a great place",
          "This very nice valley located just outside the city of La Paz is relatively small, but shows all the same traits of the Cappadocia valleys in Turkey, with unusual rock formations and amazing colours! Highly recommended if you're in the area!",
          "Valle de la Luna is an area with unusual rock formations not far outside of La Paz. I spent about an hour there walking along the trails. It has interesting views all around.",
          "After being in the city it was nice to get out into the open. Health and safety probably wouldn't pass it in the uk. There are quite a lot of places you could fall and the rails had seen better days.",
          "Nice place in La Paz Bolivia to visit whith your family or friends,good view and good climate and environment.",
          "Nice rock and earth formations to hike up and down. Very well displayed with different cactus plants spread all over.",
          "The moon valley can be visited in half a day. It is a nice surrounding, but if you have only little time I would recommend to do other things in or around La Paz.",
          "We visited the Valle de la Luna - it was in a beautiful part of town with a great view of La Paz... It's a nice hike and if you have some time in the afternoon this is great but it is far from the center of the city and not worth the trip.. If you go a little further up from",
          "The pictures look a lot better than in person. It is much smaller than I thought but is very unique. Worth the look if you have the time.",
          "This moon walk climb is very good.Very pretty site to climb walking enjoy the beauty.You must visit and spend and about an hour.",
          "Valle de la Luna is a good place where you can see the other side of Bolivia. It is an interesting place because of the landscape. It is a leisurely place where you can do probably less than 2 hours to tour.",
          "Fantastic, felt as though you are out of this world. well organized site and great visit. some hiking and hills, be ware.",
          "Great outdoorsy experience, bring your tennis shoes to do the full climbing. The sightseeing is great and pretty different to what you normally get.",
          "Cool valley located south of the city. There are two routes to take, one 15 minutes and one 45 minutes. Take the 45 minute route, but don't plan to stay much longer. A neat place to see, but 45 minutes is long enough.",
          "When we went, it was quite. We didn't take a tour, we just wondered round. For anyone interested in geological landmarks, this is awesome. A cheap taxi ride out, and a fun way to kill an hour just outside la paz.",
          "Amazing hike through incredible vistas. Bring a camera and a lunch. Good to spend the day and acclimatize when you first arrive in La Paz",
          "I would recommend heading to Valle de la Luna if you find yourself having a free day in La Paz. It's a nice way to get out of the city and provide a more dynamic and understanding experience of the city. To get their without a guided group from the center start by heading to",
          "This is a great area, so different to the rest of the natural environment we've seen. It is easy to get to by local transport and it is cheap.",
          "Dried lake bed remainder after a natural dam burst leaving uniques structures Imagining it filled with water and scuba diving in it made it more interesting to me. Sort of like the bottom of a stalagmite cave with the top removed",
          "Relax away from the city noise and come down to the natural formations. From there you can visit the zoo which is some blocks away. Take a horse trip. Rent a 4wheel or motorcicle. Or if you want to walk go down the road and come back to La Paz seeing the amazing mountains",
          "This used to be Valley of the Spirits until Neil Armstrong likened it to the surface of the moon. It is startling to see this in the midst of a major urban area. If you are in La Paz, try to get away from the downtown and see this site. It will certainly add another dimension",
          "It is, as my title suggests, a really interesting landscape, but personally I wouldn't have missed it if I hadn't have gone. There is some guy who climbs up on one of the columns to play his pipes but beware trying to take a photo without first showing him the money; he has a",
          "Be prepared to take some good hiking boots and a good hat, its dusty and sunny, just like the moon :) some weird geological formations in a pretty large area, you can chose the 20min. or the longer hikes i think there\u00b4s even a 90min one. A great experience in general, better in",
          "best way to see moon valley. use motorcycle bolivia tours. do a minimum of 3 hour tour and you won't regret it",
          "Very lunar, they actually named the area \"the moon\" because of one of our astrounaut visiting it, and saying it was moon like. It was beautiful.",
          "I did not manage to see it from inside, as it was closed when we reched there ( and we spent only one day and 2 nights in Bolivia) From outside it looked beautiful and different. If I will return to Bolivia, for sure this will be the firts place to visit again, so can see it",
          "Beautiful natural formations... too bad lots has been destroyed for housing. Be sure to take water and a snack.",
          "The Valle de la Luna is a very interesting place to walk through. It is not very expensive and you can take the 45 minute route to get the most for your money. The valley is also very close to La Paz so you can easily get there by cab for cheap. However I would recommend that",
          "The scenery is very different, lunar appears a good description, but nothing changes during the whole walk around. Worth a 30 minute look.",
          "This place is so interesting, such a different type of land scape and really looks like you're on the moon. Had a great guide but since it's located at the bottom of the city anyone can go there easily and just pay the entrance fee.",
          "This is a really cheap afternoon trip from La Paz, we spent a couple of hours there pottering around and climbing on the rocks and had a great time. Taxi up there should be quite cheap and the entrance is similarly small (can't remember exactly how much). Definitely a lot more",
          "We saw beautiful places with natural erosion, there are awesome landscapes and it is really close to La Paz 20 minutes and you can go for 5 Bs on a public bus that will leave you right in front of the atracttion. It's a good trip for one afternoon or morning :)",
          "The place ha a geologic structure very interesting but at today there are too much construction just near the border. Anyway take a trufi, mini bus or taxi from Plaza Humboldt in La Paz Sur (Calacoto) and go to direction of Mallasa (the Zoo), the ask to the driver to leave you",
          "This is a great place to visit if you like outdoors. Be prepared with good walking shoes and a sunhat and water to drink. This place as it is aptly named is indeed a bit of moon on earth.For most of us who cant go to the moon,this is the closest experience one can get of the",
          "I opted for the 45min walk - the longest. I was underwhelmed by the walk, sure it had natural structures and the pathway in between everything was cool. But, I was a little bit bored walking around. I would have liked to see more information about the structures. It was",
          "I went there on a motorcycle tour which I highly recommend. You were able to cover lots of ground without getting too tired. This place is probably no more then 20 mins away from the city center. We took public transportation for 1.5 bolivianos which dropped us right in front.",
          "It is like a moonscape with all the erosion and construction work around it. Valle de la Luna is worth at least a short visit especially if it is part of a city tour. See its photos before decising if it is for you. I did the short visit and did not take the hour-long long",
          "This quite small but interesting area is really worth a visite. The canyon like structures are beautiful to wander around. Be sure to wear sensible shoes, as there's a lot of climbing up and down, and the ground has quite a few holes dug out by the rain. It gets very hot here",
          "Moon Valley is a highlight of a La Paz visit. It's otherworldly and great to see. There are two walking options (a quick 15 minute visit, and a longer 45 minute loop). Both allow you to see the rock formations and take photos. It's a short drive out from the main historic",
          "The place is nice, with very interesting rock formations. It's not an attraction that will blow you away but it's still worth visiting if you have time to spare. There are two paths to choose from - 45min walk and 15min walk. We went for a 45 min one although I am guessing the",
          "We take the tour bus in the downtown of La Paz to the south area of the city, we go through the richest neighborhoods to end in a valley that is so impressive that you start to imagine millions of years before the city was there all the valley maybe was cover with water o maybe",
          "Having been to many a Moon Valley ( in Namibia and Chile), didn't have very high expectations from this. However once we reached there, we were blown away by the beauty of the place. Spent a good 1.5 hours exploring and walking through well marked routes. Key positives -",
          "It was ok to visit but I could easily have lived without it. It's a small area and the cliffs aren't that high. I don't know why it's in all the tourist books. The lesser known Valle de las Animas has much higher cliffs and is more adventurous to visit. Take a bus towards Palca",
          "I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this site as I found it less than appealing. Some of the walkways were not overly safe. The formations took a lot of imagination to work out what they were. Mind you we have been to the North American National Parks, so have been spoilt.",
          "Never seen so many beautiful mountains, you can enjoy the view as it would be in something of other world.",
          "In this area of La Paz you really do feel like you are on the moon. The dirt \"craters\" are so realistic. If you are lucky you will get to see some chinchillas as they scurry from mound to mound.",
          "It's a cool place located not too far from the city center. It only takes you around 20 minutes by a cab. If you have time, just pay a visit here. It takes around an hour to walk through the Moon Valley. Overall an exotic experience but it's not something that you cannot be",
          "I booked with kanoo tours for this trip, Valle de la luna was a great walk and beautiful to see. I just felt a bit rushed as we only had 45 minutes to visit this place.",
          "Its a beautiful place to go. There are a small reception and you need to pay a little fee to get inside. There are two options of walk one in 15 minutes and other 45 minutes. I take the biggest one and was amazing. PS: Don`t forget your water.",
          "Valle de La Luna is a cool moonlike landscape outside of La Paz. The surrounding area is beautiful with mountains as far as the eye can see. Valle de la Luna costs 15 bolivianos to enter and takes about an hour to hike through. It's an otherworldly place, but definitely not",
          "During our stay in La Paz, we weren't planning on visiting Valle de la Luna, but some friends who took us on a tour of the city brought us there and it was really nice. The whole area is quite impressive, bleak, very devoid of vegetation, somewhat peacefull (we went late",
          "Moon Valley is a very unique place. Conveniently placed in the souther part of the city of La Paz, Valle de La Luna is a perfect place to vist in the morning or at sunset.",
          "Cheap entry . Small site but you can get great photos. Really moon like. Great against the blue sky we had",
          "There are two trails as many have mentioned. A 15 minute trail that really takes 5 minutes and a 45 minute trail that took us a little over an hour (granted this may be due to picture taking). Overall impressive views. If it is not too hot, it was worth a visit to see this",
          "About 15 mins from the town, this place is something you wont experience while walking around La Paz. Nice to see, interesting natural forms, helpfull staff, and a different place to spend an hour or two walking around and exploring.",
          "Pretty good attraction that you can bike to easily enough. Seems like a bit of a slog on the way there, but it's actually mostly downhill on the way back and you can see the sunset and get back in time to drop the rental bikes off in time before most places close. Defo recommend",
          "i liked that it had a trail.... hmmm it didnt have a guide... i didnt like the part that it is too far away from downtown",
          "Great pics and a big mistery can come to your mind when entering this place. The staff always helpful and the conservation of the path always present over there.",
          "Why is it so popular? It is small and the photos look more impressive. Pass it by and visit somewhere else.",
          "A breathtaking landscape on the outskirts of the city. Costs 15 Bolivianos per person to enter. There are 2 trails - a 15 minute trail and a 45 minute trail. We did the 45 minute trail and it was well worth it. There were lots if opportunities to take pictures. Some areas don't",
          "I had no idea what to expect but as we drove upwards from the centre of LaPaz it got more and more intriguing. My guide was giving me lots of information, which was extremely interesting but I thoroughly enjoyed the walk through the area. Should I return to LaPaz I would",
          "Went on Four-Wheelers, enjoyed the views and solitud. You won't regret the ride. Bring a beer to enjoy once you reach the top, because you can't buy anything.",
          "There are so many wonderful things to see and do in La Paz, but this one is not so special. For some reason, many tours stop there."

          "It is a unique landscape.. But the emphasis seems to be to buy flutes etc! Get away from the crowd and just walk and climb. That's a real workout at the same time. Magnificent backdrop of hills and mountains. 15 Bob to enter",
          "Beautiful place for a small hike. It is quite far from the center of town and the bus is all but comfortable. The place itself is beautiful, but everything looks quite the same.",
          "Self guided half day tour.  No need to go with your group.  It\u2019s pretty safe even I came during the chaotic time in Bolivia. People are extremely nice. \nAs for the view it\u2019s good but you may see similar but more striking impressive sceneries.",

          "beautiful view, but kind of dangerous. if you 0lan to come here with children, please make sure they stick close to you at all times. otherwise, very beautiful place, very breathtaking.",
          "Google said they are open until 5:30pm. We got there at 4:40pm. The lady at the entrance gate said they are closed at 4pm. and didn\u2019t let us in. We\u2019ve traveled from far away to visit this place. And we don\u2019t have much time to stay in La Paz. I\u2019m so disappointed. Hopefully they are clear with their hour.",

This journey will cost just 2.60 bolivianos each way.",
          "Surely interesting geological rock formation. However, the site is surrounded by houses and it doesn't have a feeling of special site. No shops, no restaurants.",
          "Erosion at its very best. Dry to the extreme, an interesting place to visit if you are in La Paz with two hours to kill. Fee to enter less than $3. Some parts of the trail outside the main path are a bit scary with no handrail in sight. Overall a must see.",
          "Great spot for interesting geology and formations. For lighting avoid am as the sun cast large shadows. Best to go around noon or later. No handicap accessible. No guard rails in some areas so be careful but worth a visit.",
          "Spectacular rock formation near La Paz center!!",
          "Nice geological formation. A bit too close to the city, that remove some of the charm of the place.",
          "Minibus will get you there from downtown for cheap, but the ride\u2019s about 45 minutes. Can probably count on spending no more than an hour walking the trail. Plenty of steep walking paths like the city, but with better scenery.",
          "You don\u2019t need to take expensive tour to Valle de la Luna. Easy to get there by Teleferico and mini bus. My hostel was located near by blue line, so took it and changed green line to end.  Walk 10mins to Calle 8 Calacoto and take a minibus \u2026",
          "A beautiful place with a stunning views and an interesting history. Take a city tour and you will not be disappointed.",
          "Interesting place to visit if nothing else to do in La Paz. To get there and back from center can take long, specially in rush hours. Walk there is just around 45 min.",
          "Awesome. This is mis is it in La Paz",
          "Worth a visit. Nice park with interesting and beautiful rock formations.",
          "Beautiful and cool to see, but some photos can be misleading as they don't show the true size of the geological formations. Don't expect colossal mountains, but there are some very cool sightseeing spots and it can be a relaxing place if there's not too many people.",
          "Amazing place, is like to real moon",
          "It's an amazing sight to behold. Easy to get to by bus, I spent about 2 hours there wandering around and marveling at the spires and remains of erosion. You can 'do it' faster if you don't have time, but it's worth the trip if you have half a day. There are places where you can fall if you wander off the main route and are not careful.",
          "Incredible place to be.  Rock formation are amazing.  There is a charge for entrance. Its at a altitude of 3600 plus above sea level.  So travellers dont exert yourself.  Take it easy.  They loose points because their direction are very \u2026",
          "I'm giving this 5 stars because it is simply beautiful and it's a must see if you are visiting La Paz. Make sure you wear plenty of sunscreen as there is barely any shade. I would wear a hat and keep hydrated. They say follow the arrows but they are all mixed up...that is my only complaint. Again...this place is simply beautiful.",
          "I can see how this place is interesting from a geological perspective but the expansive and ugly human development around it completely detracts from any reason to enjoy it now. Wouldn't recommend a visit unless you happen to be in the area.",
          "There are better places further away fr houses and roads that are still accessible.",
          "F a n t a s t i c !\nYou can take a tour and visit Chacaltaya the same day ...\nYou will enjoy both",
          "Really unique out of this world landscape! But after walking around for a bit the whole place pretty much looks the same. \n\nTook a cable car over and the got a taxi directly to the entrance instead of taking the bus.",
          "Nice place to visit with a good viewpoint. It will take you around 45 minutes to walk around.",
          "Worth the visit if it's part of your guided city tour. Nice but not a must-see",
          "A cool 1 or 2 hour trip to the very strange place. It looks like a set from Star Wars. Bring water and SUNSCREEN. It is cool but not an OMG YOU NEED TO SEE THIS cool.",
          "It's ok..",
          "Gorgeous place.. Easy hike. The entry cost is 15 bolivianos which is a little expensive. Other than, enjoyed our visit to this place thoroughly!",

          "I liked it very much. It is a very different landscape. It is supposed to be the closest to the moon landscape on earth according to astronaut Neil Armstrong. The visit is short you can walk around and see the rock formations. i recommend it.",

          "I love this place, but it is necessary more security",
          "Very cool rock formations pretty close to La Paz. Def recommend as a few hours to get out of the city. We didn\u2019t take the telef\u00e9rico and bus/taxi , which we heard was fairly easy. But we did have our hostel call us a taxi, which we paid 140 Bolivianos to take us there, wait an hour, and drive us back.",
          "Its a beautiful park to walk around and take nice photos. Its bloody hot thou. And have to wear long sleeves due to sun radiation.",
          "Well worth a visit and close to La Paz. There and back in under 2 hours including time to take the longer path around the moon.",
          "Very nice place to go and just chill a little bit, the rocks are amazing here and you can take a lot of nice pictures",
          "Very cool, nice birds and viscacha",

          "Really cool park not too far out of the city. The hike around the park is pretty easy and the rock formations are very unique and picturesque. It really does feel like you\u2019re walking on another planet! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d",
          "If you've never seen these kind of pinnacles before, then you may enjoy this more, especially with a guided tour for more information about how the valley was formed. Though we've seen some quite grand views of other pinnacles so for us it was an unfair comparison I feel.",

          "We went when it was raining. Good thing - very few people. Bad thing - super muddy and slippery. I highly recommend hiking shoes if you come during bad weather. The place is a nice escape from the city. Cost 15Bs per person for entrance fee. The place looks like it'll erode soon so go soon.",

Merchandise sold in The Witches' Market, run by local witch doctors known as yatiri, includes potions, dried frogs, medicinal plants like retama and armadillos used in Bolivian rituals. The yatiri can be easily identified by their black hats and coca pouches containing amulets, talismans and powders that ensure luck, beauty and fertility. Most famous of all the items sold in The Witches' Market are the dried llama fetuses. These llama fetuses are buried under the foundations of many Bolivian houses as a sacred offering to the goddess Pachamama.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Mercado de las Brujas at Wikimedia Commons",

People are really nice and like to explain there costumes. On the other streets you will find a lot of gifs mainly with the typical tissues like",
          "The Witch's Market was smaller than we thought, but it was still very interesting for us to see as it was not similar to things we have seen in other places. The fact that these are still popular and actively in use was amazing for us, especially offering baby llamas!",

          "We walked around for a while to find the witches market and realised we'd been walking through it the whole time. There's not much to see, just a couple of stores on a street. Couldn't say it was much different to a usual souvenir market. Nothing we would buy either. Was nice to",
          "A visual overload as you try to understand what your eyes are seeing. This is most amazing. Talk to the vendors and have them explain what is this all used for. Explore the side streets and the local street food vendors. Whow !!",

          "It is a must see, but not very special. A set of stalls / shops. You can recognize them by the dead baby-lama\u2019s hanging. They sell lots of powders and other stuff to be healthy, happy or whatever. It is not only for fun, the Bolivian people really rely on many items, for example",
          "Some of the guides I read mentioned that apart from regular touristy merchandise the market is famous for some unusual goods such as voo doo dolls etc. Now I'm not into that but I would happily have a look as it's something I haven't seen before. None of that there, just your",
          "visit this place and it is very interesting, they sell a lot of typical crafts of the country and you can find everything for gifts and souvenirs, lots of natural plant to take, if you feel bad for the height. I highly recommend visiting this place within the city. Great",

          "My girlfriend visited La Paz 5 years ago and was really disappointed with the Witches market this time round. They offer a huge variety of tourist aimed souvenirs at next to nothing prices which is obviously good. However, it\u2019s more just market than \u2018Witches\u2019 market these days.",
          "Many friends brujas, shopkeeepers and marketeers with time and patience to explain the origins and uses of their wares. A lot of tourist trinkets but also plenty of authentic traditional items. If you have space in your backpack be sure to pick up one of the effervescent",

Very colourful and wonderful for photos. We didn\u2019t haggle, perhaps we should have, but really, things are so",

          "I didn\u00b4t know before going to the witches market that still people can buy offerings to worship ancient gods. Stuff for good luck, to attract love even black magic stuff can be found. Highly recommended if you want to see the believings of the people",

          "This looked intriguing on the Hotel map of La Paz, so I checked it out. It's a street with a number of shops selling various products associated with magic - like those types of shops in New Orleans - little trinkets and natural products. Worth a look. It then morphs into shops",
          "I regret not having enough time to hang around Witches Market. It sells stuff that cannot be found in Peru (as I just visited Peru and Bolivia this time). Look for a little knit bag with Llama shape, super cute! I can just spend the whole afternoon in the market but still some",

          "yes its probably more for \"tourists\" now but they still do have their potions and amulets and things to buy! its well worth walking around the area to get some things! nearby also the regular souvenir shops have fun with it and you will enjoy!",
          "If you want to buy the typical souvenirs, I would recommend this for you. I don't think that there is much of a witches' market left. Its mostly just touristic stalls.",
          "Weird stuff AF as dried llama fetus and spells. Worth seeing and buying coca leafs (coca leafs are NOT drug, its ancestral energetic ritual).",
          "We enjoyed looking around the Witches Market .Very interesting and lots to see .We came nearly 5 years ago and now we back again this was the first place I wanted to visit to buy some handbags!!!",
          "Here, you can find various brew and concoction ingredients used for rituals like llama fetuses along with local handicrafts made from alpaca and other local materials. You have to be prepared to climb that steep hill. Llama for offering \u201cpachamama\u201d (mother earth) for good",
          "its a fun place to go although a little small in size. some of the stalls will go at length to explain the things they sell, but it helps, of course, to speak spanish!!!",
          "So is probably the number one thing to do. It consists of a few streets and a lot of vendors selling the same wares. I guess we did see the llama fetuses, but one tires at the same stuff over and over again. We did not see any witches. In hindsight we should have bought more,",
          "We did our souvenir shopping here and found great stuff! We got very interesting info about the market on the tour we did with the \"red cap walking tours\" (also here on trip advisor) - really recommendable!",
          "This is right off of sagarnaga which is the biggest tourist hub of the city. Llama fetuses and fun/superstitious remedies. Interesting and quick to walk through. Not necessary to buy anything.",
          "It's really easy to get there, but it doesn't say \"mercado de las brujas\" anywhere, so often people aren't sure they're already there It's just a street full of little stores, full of handicraft, instruments, clothes, and local ritualistic stuff. so that's really interesting to",
          "Lots to see and lots to shock from days gone by. If you don't have a stomach for witchcraft then dont go into the shops, some of it is funny though but there is still plenty of other stuff to see in the street.",
          "The witch market is just full of interesting things! After the first couple shops, it all starts to look the same, but we continued finding new funny or interesting things with every stop. It's also fun to chat with the shop owners (if you know decent spanish) to ask what they",
          "I walked around this area several times, looking and reading at the products they are selling. I'm a lover of culture and so I respect what they have to offer and their cultural beliefs. My tour guide introduced me to this lady and talked about things she offers to better your",
          "Well, honestly, this market is just a tourist handicrafts market, rather similar to what you get in Cuzco, Machu Pichu, Quito, or other South American counties! If you are looking for a site to buy small souvenirs to your friends, go for it: it's colorful and rich! Don't get",
          "There is no Mercado de las Brujas. Its just some ladies selling stuff like herbs and trinkets that Bolivians believe will help their health and or buying a house, a car, or stuff like that. There is no attraction but they make it sound like there is one to get you to pay a tour",
          "The \"Witches' Market\" of La Paz sprawls over several blocks of one street, Calle de las Brujas. It has something fro everyone - tourist can find both cheap and expensive souvenirs. Locals can find Llama fetuses! eek! Cars drive up and down this very thin alleyway, so watch",
          "It is a fun place to visit. You can find everything you wish and more in these little shops and street vendors. It is a picturesque place with an amazing displays of colors and textures, from spices to jewelry to antiques you find it all here. It is hard not to take photos but",
          "We enjoyed browsing the numerous markets. Vendors were not as pushy as in some places. Bargaining is not so prevalent. It is a comfortable place to shop for gifts and souvenirs.",
          "There are a lot of street vendors as wells as tons of stores. I found most of my souvenirs there (alpaca shawls and blankets). Great place and very convenient for shopping. Most everyone here is willing to barter prices. As touristy as it is, you still get a great authentic",
          "Easy to get to, but it is a small street with few stores compared to other places in South America. Bit of a tourist trap.",
          "I read a few reviews about people totally disturbed by the fetuses and such. They are a bit gross, but they are not in your face. They are definitely there, but the ladies aren't forcing you to look at them. It is there tradition, respect it and move on. I don't speak very good",
          "There are definitely lots of cool things to buy here, and it's right near a neighborhood that's filled with great places to eat and shop, but in a lot of ways it's your typical tourist souvenir market, but with dead llama carcasses hanging from all the stalls.",
          "Near the cathedral San Francisco and the main tourist/handicraft area, this area sells items for traditional ceremonies (like the mesa. While not spectacular and very touristy, it is still a can't miss half and hour in La Paz.",
          "It's a small market (about 3 or 4 stores), but the tradition behind them is what matters. Try speaking to the owners, and you'll find many interesting rituals.",
          "This is absolutely one of the musts when you visit La Paz, Bolivia. It is an incredible market where you will learn about the Aymara traditions on the cult to Mother Earth, see all the types of offerings that are being done, amulets and much more. A definite must when you visit",
          "If you love to look for interesting things, this is the place for you. The street has a great variety of stores and street vendors where you can buy good presents and souvenirs at a very good price.",
          "The area has a huge amount of souvenir shops and certainly you find what you are looking for. The fact that dead animals (or part of it) are for sale is disgusting, as disgusting as going to the butcher. All meat eaters should not have any problems to be at the market. All",
          "The location is within walk of Hotel Rosario and has all the shopping you could hope for we were warned of the dangers of La Paz but never felt in danger at all. There is so much to see from musical instruments ,storage items , Alpaca, old textiles, New trend alpaca designs. all",
          "Great place to buy souvenirs and to see unusual things like llama foetus and magic potions. Some interesting finds and typical merchandise.",
          "It is interesting walking through the street, though not something you need to spend much time doing. the interesting medicinal and religious items are also commonly found in everyday markets, so we weren't very surprised by the brujas market. Howover, this is located in the",
          "Great area to shop for Bolivianite gem other tourist items. Be careful and be aware of pick pockets. Also be very aware of the traffic because they are not aware of you. Traffic in Bolivia is scary but interesting to experience. I wish the tour had allowed more shopping",
          "Once you get there you start reading boxes like \"miracle\" ones, I rather don't point them out here because there will be no interest then to go and visit, just don't be surprised to see crazy things ;)",
          "Central La Paz is a wonderful, vibrant, eclectic place. And part of this is the Witches Market. Bolivia is both deeply religious and superstitious. Which is reflected by the array of items on show. From skulls to smoking devices to numerous replicas of superstitious figures.",
          "Im not sure exactly how this became an \"attraction\" but this is not a market, its just some kiosks on the side of the road. I dont even think there is 10 of them... maybe 6-8ish. This area in La Paz is looked down upon by all locals , and all the Bolivian people in general,",
          "I was looking for a closed place with weird things but it is a street with stores. Mainly there are stores of souvenirs. Just found a few considered for witch.",
          "I had walked around the Sagarnaga street for so much time searching for this \"Mercado de las brujas\" in Spanish. I had asked 5 or 6 units of locals and tourists, each pointing out quite different location and some don't know. Even the tourist map looks inaccurate either.",
          "If you visit San Francisco Church,well then then, Witches a Market is only a 3 minute walk around the corner from there. Don't be too squeamish though!",
          "I was expecting a large market but what this actually is, is a line of stalls on the street (maybe 8 - 10) much as you see everywhere else in La Paz. What makes this different are the products on sale. There is coca leaves and teas, all kinds of herbs, amulets for every",
          "Wander round this safe area and pick up a gift or two - from coco leaves to small carvings. The ladies are helpful. I purchase some ointment and still here to tell the tale.",
          "It is really nice and entertaining. Bring cash to buy souvenirs. Don't make jokes in any language about what you see, it's a different culture and it's necessary to respect it. The witches might help you with any wish you need to come true. Ask around!",
          "You can find all sorts of odd herbal medicine here. I had no idea what any of this was which is probably a good thing as I found the dead llamas disturbing. This place seems very touristy I did not see any locals shopping here. Worth a visit if you are in the area but I",
          "It is actually a very touristy place but the ambiance is really nice. You will find different local handcrafted items at affordable prices.",
          "You will find all kinds of medicin, trinkets and souvenirs. If you haven't had time to buy alpaca clothes, you can do it here too.",
          "The marked was a little disappointing to be honest. Only a few of the shops sold some peculiar things that can be associated with witches. The rest of it was typical tourist things (that you can find anywhere in Bolivia). I still had a good time though, and the marked should",
          "Many tourists, shop owners beckoning for us to enter. Much better markets (admittedly not selling goods quite so unique) elsewhere in La Paz.",
          "This place is horrible! Okay; if you like cheap stuff guess it is great. But there are dead baby llamas and embryos everywhere. Suppose to be a gift to Mother Earth, but i think it is horrible. In every shop, there are about 4 to 8 dead animals hanging there. It is disgusting",
          "Much more expensive then other markets, completely built for tourist. You don't see a local buying nothing there. But don't go to la Paz without visiting it.",
          "A good and safety place to buy a lot of souvenirs, sometimes could be hard to bargain, but walk around, if somebody was not friendly, go to another shop and ask (you won't die if won't try a discount).",
          "The Witches Market is a must see for first-timers to La Paz. You can find quite of variety of things here from touristy souvenirs to bizarre items such a dried llama fetuses. One thing is for sure, this is a very fun and colorful place to visit when you are in La Paz. There",
          "This basically is a shopping street with one \"shaman/witches'\" establishment. It is worth strolling the area if only for the people watching aspects. Prices are generally reasonable, and there is some interesting jewelry. Unless you are an avid shopper, this will not take a",
          "An interesting place to visit, especially you can see the customs of the first Bolivians. Especially the recognition of Mother Earth, for who is offered all these artifacts. It is a mixture of religious and pagan belief for those who want to get an idea of the Andean spirits",
          "You must go there and buy some rare presents and take pictures, the street is not safe but i recomend to take a city tour with an agency",
          "This was on the top of my list for Lima and it was interesting enough with weird and disgusting things on offer but it was far smaller than I had imagined and all the stalls were basically the same. So worth a visit for the interest but don't plan to spend ages there!",
          "Thought it would be more interesting than it really was. The shops are all over the place and besides some 'dried' baby alpaca's nothing crazy is going on.",
          "The witch market is really interesting and offers a lot of weird but funny things to by. As it is in the Center you can do it within little time.",
          "After hearing so much about the Witches Market this was disappointing for me. Yes, there were several shops displaying dead llamas - from fetus (not really sure how small that would be - they were all fully formed, just minature, leading me to wonder if they were real) to 2 feet",
          "Beautiful handmade everything... I bought customer made leather shoes & jackets...so may beautiful things. Haggle haggle. You'll get great prices. Oh wear flats. It's all uphill I advice to start up top & work your way down. A must.",
          "This is a street you will be taken by your guide on your city tour.You can buy local products around here.You can walk for a few minutes around here.",
          "This witches Market or street is quite different. Worth the visit and walk .You will be taken here by the guide in your city tour.",
          "Women at stalls did not know about using catalyst with coca leaves! Not as good as witches market in Lima.",
          "Not sure if it was in full swing as we went on a Sunday. Interesting to see some of the shops, but also conscious that don't want to be there just to look and stare as the locals still believe in these traditions.",
          "Mercado de La Brujas is quite a different market. With lots of bric/brac and things to give you luck, it a place to buy little trinkets that would make you feel better (if you believe in this stuff, but no harm). The lady who sold me the coca tea and anis tea said the that tea",
          "Not really a market as such. A line of shops with some interesting things and trinkets to buy. Stuff you will not see anywhere else like charms to ward away evil spirits, etc. Definitely worth a look if you are in the area.",
          "Lots of crafts here, but an unexpected find were the musical instrument stores. A great place to purchase a guitar or the typical Bolivian charango, not the souvenir type , but the real thing!!!",
          "You'll have a very colorful view of La Paz on these streets. Don't let the name fool you, most of the witch's stuff is just for show. It's worth passing by.",
          "Close to the centre of the town \u0131s the Witches Market where you can buy all sorts of talismans and potions. Several of the buyers were only missing thee costumes but none the less a great attraction",
          "A fun, compact market with things you probably won't find in other markets, like llama fetuses. A good place to go shopping for souvenirs and other trinkets to bring back home.",
          "We didnt walk through the market until late in the evening, but there was a lot of interesting stuff to see. Be warned, getting there involves steep hills. If you are not up for climbing up steep stairs, plan to take a cab and get let off as close as possible.",
          "Be careful not to lose yourself for the entire day here! We set out just to buy a few gifts for family and friends and after haggling prices every few steps we quickly lost most of the day! If you're heading away from the beginning of the market, you cross a road that splits it",
          "Interesting place to visit with some weird items for sale. In the market for llama fetus? This is the place to shop. Need some good luck amulets? Go no further. But we did find a certain sameness after visiting several of the stores. Prices are low and the vendors are not",
          "This market is quite different from anything we have seen, so althought its really just few stalls along the street, I am glad we got the chance to visit. Where else would you be able to see the lama fetuses being sold, right?",
          "A few street of unique shops from traditional herbal remedies to souvenirs to the Witch doctor places. We went into one and the lady in broken English was very engaging and prices were very low. Everything from shrunken alpaca fetus to dried things we did not want to know",
          "If you are in La Paz, do find time to visit the Witches Market. As others have noted, you'll come face to face with llama fetuses which can be a bit unnerving the first time. But to be honest, we found a certain sameness and repetitive feel after visiting several shops. Many",
          "delightful fun, enertaining and interesting. The sight, the sounds, the smells, the experience, it was veery fun",
          "Our guided tour took us to the witches market and I can't say it's my kind of place. I appreciate different traditions but seeing Llama fetus' hung all over the different shops and stalls isn't very nice.",
          "Interesting place. I thought it would be a real market but it's just a lot of shops in two/three parallel streets. You can find VERY different things, Each shop has a Bolivian woman as the owner, they are all very friendly and nice! I took a picture of one of them, she smiled so",
          "Tourist novelty market where you can find actual Bolivian witches selling herbs, ointments, special gemstones, Llama fetuses and all kinds of fascinating trinkets as part of their belief in magic. On Sundays some of the stalls are closed. Worth taking a walk through if you're in",
          "The witche's market is a street including some boutiques where you can buy weird stuff to do magic. It's nice to see and you don't have to plan a lot of time to go there. But it's worth it just to see the dead llamas. It's taking you out of your comfort zone.",
          "A place that could look only for tourist but indeed still used by local people to find all what is necessary for ancient magician rituals.",
          "Great stuff very quircky place but a must to visit, you can walk along the streets and find clothes, jewerly and lot of weird things you will never see in Europe.",
          "I've heard so many people rave about this street and completely understand why! Although the dead animals and abundance of other things make this street a cool stop. This street plays a huge part in the Bolivian culture. Many of the herbs, candies and other items sold are used",
          "There are more tourist shops here than the ones selling the witch stuff. Some of the latter opens late in the day and in the evening. The selection of goods in the witch shops varies from the more curious stuff - like sacred wood to use for offering - to the more obscure and",
          "Walking through a few shops on this street is something that can only be done here. It's helpful to go with a walking tour or read about things first to know what you are seeing. But there a many things in each small shop - llama fetuses, alters, candies for alters, coca,",
          "This is a good place to visit last before you head home from South America. Its souvenirs are by far the cheapest of the Andean countries with plenty of variety. Haggling is OK.",
          "In the shadow of the Catholic church is the mercado de las brujas. Lots of alpaca, woven goods, souvenirs and prices vary. The brujerias, witchcraft shops, are fascinating. Everything from remedies for arthritis or for the lovelorn, to ritual offerings to the pacha mama are for",
          "Tge witchcraft stuff didn't really work that much for me. It's a bit creepy - selling dry lama fetuses next to coca-cola, pringles and lama sweaters. Worth a stroll as you'll probably be accommodated in the area but don't plan on spending too much time on it.",
          "This would be pretty cool if it were set apart from the rest of the street stalls and kiosks in La Paz, but like many other reviewers have said, it's really nothing special and you will easily miss it if you aren't looking closely. The llama fetuses are a little creepy, and some",
          "It's a good place to buy travel gifts. I also went to Uyuni and other places but the prices here were better.",
          "We went to this place after visiting Moon Valley. The shops are pretty identical in terms of the stuff they are selling. If you wish to come and take a look only, don't come on holidays as most of the shops are closed. There are some souvenir shops and cafes nearby.",
          "A few llama fetuses, some dried herbs and cacti on the sidewalk, and a sign above a kiosk were the only distinguishing marks of the Witches' Market from the rest of the many souvenir shops. Nothing interested me and I was on my way in three minutes or so.",
          "Its a good place to go and meet. Its like a big street market with a lot of local store selling clothes and Bolivian souvenirs. Its a free tour and you can buy lot of stuff over there. Usually you can bargain.",
          "this place has changed a lot since i first went in 2008.... there are a lot more ponchos and general tourist tat than before but it doesnt mean you cant still get down to the base roots of the place. you can have your coca leaves read or just sit down and talk about the exotic",
          "Honestly I was kind of unimpressed here. Maybe we weren\u2019t in the main part of it but I felt it was rather small and really the only thing that stood out that made us realize it was the witches market was the dried hanging baby llama fetusus. Outside of that there wasn\u2019t a ton to",
          "I was surprised by the little shops selling everything for good luck or whatever you need help with. There are places where they can read your future on coca leafs. Artisan shops. Enjoyed the visit.",
          "It's only a few stalls and the owners aren't polite at all. It's worth going because they have a handful of strange things, but don't expect to spend longer than 45 minutes looking around.",
          "An exceptional experience - both for believers and non-believers. It says a lot about the culture and heritage of Quechua Indians. Uncommon attraction in the heart of modern metropolis of La Paz.",
          "The mercado de la hechicera, witch market, is not a whole huge market, but only a few stands on the street with esoteric products for health for people who believe in witch craft or homoopathy medicine. Anyways, it's worth a visit to see all the dead lama embryos hanging around",
          "It was a great place to buy weapons of destruction. I found all the things I need to take over the world. Great place overall.",
          "The headline says everything ... nothing really Special there, can skip this for sure if you do not want to buy some crazy bolivian souvenirs which have nothing to do with Bolivia",
          "Yes this is definitely a touristy place. However, if you look carefully beside the funky and really touristy stuff you can find some real gems. We were warned to be careful for pickpockets and other annoyances. However in the 4 days that we spent in La Paz, before leaving for",
          "Thirty years ago this was an interesting market. Now it is a pathetic tourist draw for anyone interested in kitch.",
          "I looked at the street signs and looked at the map again, but I still wasn't sure I was in the right place. Mercado makes me think of a big market, but the place marked on the map as \"Mercado de las Brujas\" was only a couple stores selling mostly incense and charms.",
          "Seeing the various dried animals was not my taste and there is definitely a touristy feel to the area. It really isn't much different than the rest of the area around Sagarnaga, but you might as well experience it while you are in the area.",
          "our hotel was just in this area so we have had the chance to pass through this market several times. suggestive and mysterious",
          "This is one touristy place for sure. Beware of pickpockets as review mention that this place was not so safe at all. Most of the shops sell identical stuff. Its good to walk around and take a look, ask for price before purchasing. Difficult to bargain whenever fancy. Sell werid",
          "Unlike anywhere else. Great fun, lots to look at and all sorts of souvenirs (if you want to take them home!) that you could imagine. Lots of places to get an excellent hot chocolate.",
          "You'll see things that you have no idea could be sold. Some is just down right disgusting like dead animals but it is interesting and provides for a fun afternoon. There are potions, dead frogs, powders for good luck, fertility. The dried lama fetus are maybe too much but it is",
          "Such a fun place to walk through. You can purchase really weird things such as mummified baby llamas and various herbs. I felt safe walking through at night. I would recommend against bringing a stroller/wheelchair. The roads are uneven and broken throughout this street.",
          "Ok, so once you get over the llama fetus this basically is yet another tourist market, but very quiet the day we went. Sales staff not that happy, collectively!",
          "It was great to be there but maybe we;ve been to a lot of places like this already! It;s good experience though!",
          "Most of the reviews for the Witches Market are under \"Calle Sagarnaga\". This is definitely a great experience and a must! It has all the old culture from Bolivia along with the tourist shops!",
          "1. don't miss the graffiti on the walls. They can be very beautiful. 2. it felt safe walking during the day. 3. uphill walk can sometimes be tiring if you had just stepped off the plane",
          "Went there hoping to find some interesting items. Place was packed with locsls.i really stood out and like a fool I stayed. Felt something tickle top of my head and when I looked up they grabbed my passport from my pocket. Avoid any crowded place in Bolivia crime rate is",
          "Do you want a ring, a hammock, a t-shirt, some trousers, some lotions or potions? it's all here if you have the time to root around. It is very close to the main street and there are enough different stalls to while away a couple of hours. It might be best if you have a clear",
          "Interesting to visit. But even better if a local can explain what all the dead baby animals, potions, stones & Artifac are for. Otherwise it is hard to get a good understanding/gauge.",
          "Anyone going to La Paz should try to see the witches market. It is an unusual place that makes it interesting. Weird, colorful display of voodoo stuff for sale from anything to charm a lover or cure a serious ailment. Whatever your heart desires is here.....as long as you",
          "I was expecting more as I'd heard so much about the markets. They're strewn along the streets where traffic still drives past, rather than in a big segregated area, so is very crowded and a bit crazy. The stalls themselves are great, everything you'd ever want to buy and some",
          "- Lets just say I have never been to a market just like this one! Despite the high altitude in this country, i truly enjoyed walking around market. Everything you can find here are pretty much sovenirs but there are some shops that sell really weird and wonderful things that",
          "The witches market is on Melchor Jimenez, a little off Linares, behind San Francisco Church. It is a fascinating place to wander. Some of the things on sale look a bit gruesome and animal lovers may get a bit upset. The most popular item for sale is Llama foetuses. They are",
          "I liked the proximity of Witches market to La Casona Boutique Hotel - It's mostly one street with shops and outside street stalls selling unusual wares. Good to visit.",
          "My rating is based on the fact that I hate shopping, especially when things look the same from one store to the next. That said, if you are interested in seeing some creepy things like Llama fetuses (naturally aborted fetuses) which are used as ceremonial sacrifices for some of",
          "Is amazing, u can find everytingh, and la bolivianita is the best store there, people is friendly and you learn a lot of bolivian culture, and it is ok if you want to take pictures",
          "While in La Paz, I definitely recommend walking through this market at night. If you know Spanish, it is interesting to ask the shop owners the functions of different items such as dehydrated llama fetuses.",
          "Coco leaves, llama fetuses, potions, etc. an interesting place to spend an hour or two. Thought that the llama fetuses would be an interesting piece but definitely didnt want to encourage or support that market.",
          "It\u2019s not really much of a spectacle\u2026 just more shops and street stalls, but if you look closely you will find some unusual pieces, presumably used in the making of spells. Llama foetuses are also on display in many of the shops and stalls (see my photos). Potions and drugs are",
          "Whether you are looking for typical handicrafts or original solutions for different ailments, this is the place to go! Remember that prices are not holy here, and don't hesitate to negotiate, especially if you are buying more than one item.",
          "Not as big as I thought it would be but still large considering you've got some very steep roads at high altitude to navigate. You can buy a cure for anything in the world and see some strange stuff like lamas heads for sale. A must see in La Paz.",
          "if you really want to explore any of those interesting markets in Bolivia, you need days... so many things you have never seen there, and so little time. you better speak spanish!",

          "I expected more from this attraction. I have visited far more interesting markets selling 'potions' elsewhere in the world, especially in Africa. The llama foetuses are interesting, but there is not much else. It is generally similar to markets and stalls in nearby streets in La",
          "While I didn't have a problem with the witches market, it wasn't as cool as the guidebooks had made it sound. It was actually pretty small - only a couple of places along one street. The street is in a touristy area near lots of hostels, so it was convenient to get to. I would",

          "Unless you are looking for a musical instrument, or just want to satiate your curiosity as to what shrivelled llama foetuses and Aymara amulets look like, this so called tourist attraction is really overrated. In fact, along the length of the street, there are only a few shops",

          "Yes, there are more Gringos here than Bolivians but it is a fascinating place and in my opinion a must to visit when in La Paz. Great area to buy presents to take home and there are also some very good quality artisan items if you search for them, often off the main street, in",
          "Yes, this is the place to come for little souvenirs. There are all manner of little trinkets designed for tourists. Some interesting things, and some not so much. And likewise, you will see plenty of tourists walking down the market street.. But, it's not all bad. It also",
          "We stayed at the hostel: La Posada de La Abuela Abdulia in the middle of the witches market. Frankly I am glad that we stayed in this area because La Paz doesn't have a lot of nightlife going on and out of all the places we visited in the city there were always a few bars open",
          "The famous La Paz Witches\u2019 Market was a 15 minute walk from our hotel, The Rosario. For fans of the macabre the market sells a bizarre assortment of goods, including dried llama foetus which, if buried under the entrance to a home, brings the occupier good luck. A tempting",
          "Fairly near the bus station and near the major hostels so likely that you will come across it staying in La Paz. The market is full of tat for gringos but at either end go and see the crazy ladies with Llama foetuses (people bury them under their house for good luck)."

          "Went up just before sunset and had the most beautiful 360 view of the city. Slightly difficult to reach as we tried walking the first day but ended up going back to our hostel when we realized that we wouldn't make it up the stairs due to the altitude. Went by taxi the next day",

          "Quite a great escape from busy La Paz! But you are well advices to take a cap or Bus up the hill since it can be quite a hard walk due to the altitude. There is a clean public bathroom right in front and the entrance to the mirador is free of charge. It can be quite cold when",
          "There are a few spots around La Paz that overlook the city centre and thus offer amazing views, but Mirador Killi Killi definitely has the most sweeping vista to see. Might be an idea to take a taxi up to the viewpoint if you have any mobility challenges as the approaching",
          "About a 30 minute uphill walk from the centre, the mirador is worth a visit if just to put your altitude adjustment to the test! The views of la paz, el alto and illimani are worth the hike up",
          "If you want a fantastic view of La Paz, this is almost the best lookout point in the city. In particular, come here for the sunset.",
          "Visited early July 2017 as part of a city tour solely for me. Fortunately, despite it being winter, the weather was bright and sunny and so I was able to take photos of the vista from all angles. Ten minutes is long enough.",

          "We walked from Plaza Murillo to there, was around 30 minutes, slow walk, keep going up till Avenida Sucre, then up following the direction on the map. It offers a good view of the city, if is a sunny day you will get great pictures. If you have a map it will be easy to get there.",

          "We originally planned to go to Mirador Laikakota, but that seemed poorly maintained and not that great. So we went to killi killi around the corner instead. Incredible views and a great platform! A must when in La paz!",
          "The Mirador Killi Killi is easy to be reach by taxi and offers a unique view of the city. Also the panorama photos taken there are amazing. Young people still can climb by foot, but seniors should take a taxi driver, who knows where is the mirador...I choose the wrong one, but",
          "20 minute ride out of the center, you can walk up if your in good condicion. Nice spot, but look out for faulse guides and picpockets",
          "If you are passing by, it's worth a quick little walk to check out the views. Don't worry if ya miss it though.",
          "One can reach this high lookout point in La Paz by various means of transport but getting there by foot is a pleasant challenge. Recommended though after a few days in the city. Beautiful views in all directions but in particular when the Illimani is seen",
          "This mirador offers unobstructed views of La Paz and also some decent bathroom facilities. It's in the shape of a semi-circle, which will enchant selfie aficionados.",
          "A very peaceful place, with great views. It's a hike to the top, but well worth it. Or catch a cab ;)",
          "It's a lot of fun to take a cable car with the locals to see La Paz from the altitude of 4000 m but the best panoramic view opens from the Mirador Killi Killi. Advantages: no queues to get on a cable car. You can walk to the place or to take a taxi. Bear in mind that the last",
          "Great location to view this mountainous city. Not to miss. We arrive at sunset and must be a perfect time to see the city in shades.",
          "I simply walked from the old historical center to the mirador, such a great walk, and such a breathtaking view. and it's free!!!!",

          "The mountain has spectacular views of the modern city with its mountainous backdrop. Good for a birds eye view of la paz. Highly recommended.",
          "We did it the easy way and we got to Killi Killi by car, at the beginning of our tour of the city. La Paz is located like in a cup, with the city center at the bottom of a cup and then houses that seem to be getting up on the mountains surrounding on all sides. From Killi Killi",
          "Loved this little viewing point located a ways from the city center. Worth a trip if you have an hour or so to burn. The most interesting way to get here is on foot but a taxi is a bit easier.",
          "Killi Killi is right in the middle of the city. Excellent for taking pictures, early morning or sunsets. You can have almost 360\u00ba views of La Paz. You can walk up the hill, but it's better to take any public transportation.",
          "That's ok to walk a little to have a different view from La Paz. You can walk to this place taking around 20 minutes by foot from the Iglesia de San Francisco.",
          "You have the most amazing view of the city and can take great pictures! And on the way there you can see the city and the life of Bolivians with their interesting and differnt shops and groceries...",
          "Nice place to go. We walk from Plaza Mayor (marcado lanza), it's not very far but it's a uphill walk, so if you are in good shape, it's not a problem to walk there, or take the taxi (it's cheap)",
          "It doesn't look like much from down below but hike up or take a taxi and you will be glad you did. You will see the valleys of LaPaz and get a much better sense of the city layout and size.",
          "The views are very nice and the locations of Killi Killi its more center in the city. Great to take a lot of pictures and have a better idea of the city and the Alto.",
          "Good short trip located somewhat close to La Paz\u00b4 center. Take a bus up there because there is no footpath and it is real steep. One has a great overview over the lengthy city shape and the surrounding mountains. It is for free, too ;)",
          "This lookout was just a short walk from my hotel, mind you it was uphill a lot, but you get used to hills when you are in Boliva, don't you? It was in a safe neighbourhood and free to enter and take photographs.",
          "Although we enjoyed the beautiful views from the lookout point, it was difficult to ignore the many stray dogs that inhabit the area and the strong urine smells from those who mistake the area as a public urinal. This is not a spot to enjoy a picnic lunch. We recommend taking a",
          "From central (for instance the catedral) it's only a 25 minute walk or less, and the hill is quite short, so no real need to take a taxi like most suggest unless you don't like walking and have a hotel / hostal in sopocachi or something. It's a nice view, and good for if you",
          "I walked from sopocachi my third day in La Paz. Things in the valley can appear deceptively close on maps, so remember the hills. If you're not acostumed to the altitude, take a cab as this is quite the hike. However, great 360 degree views of the city that left me more",
          "we visited Mirador Killi Killi as part of the city bus tour, the guide was friendly and pointed out points of interest. The views from this point are priceless and a must see!",
          "We visited this lookout on a city tour and it gives a view across most of the old city. Well worth the stop.",
          "It was one of the stops of our city tour.The view of the city is magnificent, there are benches where you can sit and admire the scenery. Wear good walking shoes, sunscreen, hat and bring along a camera to take with you unforgettable memories.A must visit place in La Paz.",
          "We stopped off as part of a morning tour and was definitely worth a look with stunning views across La Paz. As the story goes this is where the indigenous fought off 10,000 attacking spaniards back in the day. Great view of the football stadium as well.",
          "After driving to many small places and looking at different sights, it is best to take a breather and pause to enjoy the view of the city. Love how I was able to just sit, look and admire how lucky I am to be blessed to visit Bolivia. Love to see how the city comes together. Not",
          "A great place to go and enjoy a picnic lunch (tienda's nearby will sell snacks and sodas) We recommend getting a nice take out lunch from the City Centre and spending an hour at Killi Killi enjoying the unparalleled views and photo opportunities. Remember to bring a blanket,",
          "Since we were some of the lucky few, the altitude didn't affect us much. So the small set of stairs you need to walk to the top weren't that bad. Mirador Killi Killi is easily accessible by taxi, and is free of charge to visit! At the top, there was a mariachi band playing and",
          "The walk to this place is a little steep, but definitely worth the effort to get one of the best views of the city. With the mountain in the background, this place is simply wonderful.",
          "One of my favorite places to have a landscape look of La Paz. I've taken different travelers and all enjoy the views. It is easy for me to show them where are the main things or buildings. Just make sure to go during day time as night can get a bit shady.",
          "It's very easy to get there, either walking or by public transportation. A peaceful place with an amazing view. Good for taking pictures or just to sit and relax.",
          "At first I didn't really want to climb all the way up, but I had some free time so I did. And I'm truly glad for that because this view is breathtaking. Even better than the Teleferico!",
          "For just a small walk you are overly rewarded by the view. It's s no brainer really. It's stupid to go to la Paz and not climb up to see the view from here. Absolutely amazing!",
          "Stunning panoramic views of the city. Well worth the steep walk up there. Not much else going on so only need to allow an hour or so.",
          "Of course, you should be extremely careful to go to Mirador Killi Killi at night, however, it gives you a awesome night view of the city of La Paz. It looks like so many stars fallen to the earth around the mirador.. I recommend that you should talk with a taxi driver for the",

          "The lookout point and view is incredible, but if you have young children the park in this location is a must-see attraction. ITs very big with many sections for both young and older children. best park in La Paz",
          "Don't miss this view point. You'll get a 360\u00b0 view of the city and great pictures. After taking pictures from El Alto, this is a must see. Take a micro from Calle Yanacocha and Comercio to \"Villa Pab\u00f3n\" and ask the driver to take you to Mirador Killi Killi.",

          "With the sun at your back, a morning time visit to this scenic lookout is worth the time. I took a cab up to the entrance from the Hotel Rosario and spent a half-hour framing various shots with my camera. A walk down the hill to Plaza Murillo and Calle Jaen made for a nice",
          "Killa Killi viewpoint (kestrels) is a good spot for great photos overlooking La Paz. You not only get the city spread out below you, but you have good terrain and mountain shots as well. You can also take photos of La Paz's fascinating aerial gondola \"subway\" that leads from",

          "Nice place to get views of the sprawling city of La Paz & its surrounding snow capped mountains. The sunset light hitting the mountains was beautiful. We came about 20min before sunset and it was worth it. But we'd recommend coming a bit earlier than the scheduled sunset time",

          "A great place to get a 360 degree view of the city of La Paz. Just remember that you are at 13000 feet, so I suggest taking an inexpensive taxi to the top.",
          "Took a cheap cab ride to Mirador Killi Killi, and received a beautiful view of the city. Went in the evening time, best time for photos because there's less glare off the buildings. Due to the steep roads in La Paz, best to cab up, but walk back down. I think the only viewpoint",
          "Views of La Paz at most viewpoints are a worth it but seeing as Mirador Killi Killi is only a short walk away from the centre it would be rude not to have a look.",
          "Is easy to walk to from the Cathederal Plaza and gives a great view of the city from both sides of the mountain.",
          "Nice overview of the city. If you can go near the sunset, that would be nice. We took a bus to go there and after that went to see Plaza Murillo. Very nice combination.",
          "Great place to take photos and observe the city from a strange vantage point you fell like in the middle of the city, on a hill top with a 360 degree view its pretty cool and unique, on a sunny day try to avoid sunburn with a hat but it can also be windy.",
          "It's another point of view on La Paz. You nhave to pay to access the mirador (10 Bs). Nice view, but windy",
          "The Walk To The Mirador was a great fun. The view from the top was amazing. We even stayed an hour and played cards up there.",

          "Really worth it to spend an hour or more on the hike up here, it's just around 1,5 km from the city center but yes, it's uphill. So take it easy and slow and you will really enjoy the result when you get to the top. Amazing views of all the town of La Paz!",
          "You understand from here how big is the city. It worth a visit and reaching it by foot is a great satisfaction",
          "This is maybe the main public balcony where you can see a beautifull landscape. The downtown, Miraflores Neighborhood, South area, the mountains, the Teleferico, El Alto city... you will be able to see the city as if you were flying. You must take your camera!",
          "Although you will not be able to see the whole city, you will see a great view of a part of it. Security guard gives the impression of a secure site. Lots of people come to see the city from this point, but its not crowded and you can enjoy the view without big noise.",
          "If you come here at sunset, you might end with some good timelapses of the city. The view is quite nice and wide. The downside is that at night the neighborhood is not really welcoming.",
          "Well worth the trouble. The view of La Paz is great. I took a few panoramas and they have come out well. The 360* view of the city shows how big it is.",
          "It had a nice view of Valle de Luna (Valley of the Moon) and better picture taking opportunity than the Teleferico. If you're in the area and have a couple dollars to spare on a taxi ride up, then it's worth a visit. Otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way for this.",
          "The way up there leads you through the local markets what is pretty cool ... on our way to the stadium we crossed the view point where you have nice sights of the skyline and the sourounding, did not get up there but from the streets you have a nice view too",
          "Its super windy up there however nothing can beats the spectacular view 360 degree around it. Grab a taxi up instead of walking up because its gotten be painful as its upslope. You can view almost the whole vastness of La Paz city and cant keep your eyes away from it. Enjoy the",

          "It's a bit a pain to get to, but once you've arrived this vista gives you tremendous 360 degree views of the vastness that is La Paz, as well as the surrounding volcanoes and mountains. You cannot help admire the size of Bolovia's primary capital city from this vantage and we",

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country.

In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts that allowed the team to rise again as one of the most important in the country.\n\nLa Paz F.C. : Founded in 1989, the club quickly rose through the ranks to become the third major club in the capital, only behind in popularity to the two well-established city rivals.The city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:\n\nAcademia de Balompi\u00e9 Boliviano\nAlways Ready\nChaco Petrolero\nClub 31 de Octubre\nDeportivo Municipal de La Paz\nFraternidad Tigres\nMariscal Braun\nUniversitario de La Paz\nClub Uni\u00f3n MaestranzaWith the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Uni\u00f3n Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the Estadio Hernando Siles, which also hosts the national football team and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times.

It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport.\nInternational carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca, LATAM Airlines and Peruvian Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, Santiago and Cusco. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft.\nAirport facilities include ATMs, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, car rentals, duty-free shops, and free Wi-Fi internet. Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines.\nThere are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

          "Even that was under construction, we still enjoyed the beuaty of the marine inspired statues and the beautiful sunsets. Besides de WHale Museum is the only thing worth to visit in the city",
          "Nice and friendly people, fantastic fresh food, and a turquoise and calm sea. La Paz is a perfect place to relax.",
          "This is one of the nicest malecones to walk great people and awesome sites. Lots of bars and restaurants and museum",
          "....because there isn't. Goes for miles, nice view of the harbor and waterfront. Plenty of restaurants and bars nearby, very little shopping except for usual Mexican trinkets. Not interested in returning, and I have been all over BCS.",

          "The Malecon is so enjoyable. Their are so many activities going on at the same time. Beach volleyball right beside it, kids and adults riding bikes, rollerblading,eating ice cream, people watching, eating delicious food, watching the sunset to name a few.",
          "Malecon is a very nice seaside resort. Lots of bars and restaurants for both families and couples. There is a good sea front promenade, with lots to see. The is a string of statues on the route to appreciate. Set back a couple of streets from the front is the shopping area. The",
          "Lots of beautiful statues and tons of couples and families walking around. And of course right on the water. Great activity after dinner when you don\u2019t want to go home just yet. Fun mix of locals and tourists!",
          "Walking down the Malec\u00f3n at sunset is a must do for locals and tourists. Grab an ice cream and enjoy the cool sea breezes which will bring 'Paz' to your soul after a long day on the beach or at sea.",
          "This is a lovely, long walk along the bay at the edge of town with several impressive sculptures. On the historic part of the old town.",
          "This is a lovely walk along the beach in La Paz. On the one side there are restaurants, shops, etc. On the other there is the beach and the Sea of Cortez. If you are in La Paz, I recommend a leisurely stroll along the Malecon.",
          "Last week my friend and I went into a shop and I looked out just in time to see a dolphin feeding. He popped up twice fairly close to shore. Wow",
          "Love the improvements La Paz is doing to the Malecon. It's really shaping up to be a beautiful project and really enhances the downtown feel.",
          "Dotted with statues depicting the Gulf of California, this is a La Paz highlight. Join local families as they come out in the evening to socialize and relax.",
          "....we'll be havin' some fun in Baja! La Paz is an interesting town. The boardwalk has a surprising diversity - boba cafe, high-end sushi, everyday local agua fresca stores where families order ice cream (served in an open snack chip bag, very clever!). Water is flat, flat,",
          "You can spend hours here, enjoying the sounds and smells of the ocean, watching boats and people. I liked to go to the east side and grab ice cream and watch the people! The Sculptures are wonderfully done and make it very easy to land mark with",

          "If it to go for a walk, jog or bike ride it's a wonderful place to go for a stroll or just hand out and watch the sunset... Restaurants along the Malecon are awesome!!!",
          "We stayed at The Perla hotel which is right on the Malecon. Along the Malecon you will see tons of statues, quaint restaurants and coffee shops. Just a couple blocks off the Malecon you find banks, shops and more restaurants. Well worth spending a couple of days here.",
          "The Malec\u00f3n in La Paz is beautiful lots going on and plenty of ocean views to keep you walking farther and farther. Shopping is across the street all along the walk as well. Very safe police are everywhere as traffic tends to be heavy. Lots of bicycles and roller blades. It",

          "I really enjoyed this beautiful Malec\u00f3n. It\u2019s about 20min (non stop. Looks fat but it\u2019s really not) walk from the main strip attraction. You can purchase tours, great food and souvenirs. The views are so beautiful. Once you start your walk from the first statue I believe by the",

          "beautiful water, boats to watch, nice walkway, intersting statue/sculpture along the way. Excellent mango gellato a block or so from the whale museum",
          "to see some great street art. Sculptures, murals, street markets with artisan crafts set up at night, all off the side streets from the malecon. I was a solo female traveler and felt entirely safe walking all around the area at night.",
          "People giving this anything less that four or five stars are questionable, I just can't see why anyone would rate the La Paz Malecon as anything less that four or five stars. I didn't even bother to look at their comments, and you shouldn't either. This is a great, LONG,",
          "We loved walking the Malecon everyday. It is beautiful to feel the breeze off the sea and plenty of spots on the beach to sit and enjoy the sunshine or a sunset.",
          "An amazing Malecon, dotted with statues, and bike lanes so we felt safe riding our bikes. Very picturesque with lots of great eating places.",
          "Three miles of sites, sounds, restaurants, sculptures, the best ice cream in town! Lots of tourists, but mostly from the area. A great contrast to the insanity of Cabo. Next time we're going to rent bikes and go all the way up and down it.",
          "It's very nice to walk over there mainly at sunset. Several restaurants and gift shops across the Malecon.",
          "so much fun...enjoy in the evening when all the locals are out strolling and watching the sunset. many interesting sculptures and art work along the way also",
          "Great way to soak up Mexican seaside resort culture. Note 90% of people on Malecon are Mexican, so this is a refreshing change for anyone seeking antidote to the Cabo Resort experience. Quiet by day, busy at night - even on weekdays. Lots of nice restaurants, shops and cafes",
          "The Malecon is a nice level walkway along the Beach in La Paz. It\u2019s great for bikes,wheelchairs and scooters. Not much shade though. It\u2019s across the street from lots of different restaurants.",
          "Nice place for a stroll, was not too busy which was great. Lots of restaurants and a few souvenir shops",
          "It's a nice walk along the Malecon. You'll see lots of shorebirds like pelicans, ibis, herons in the morning and if you are interested in art you'll find more than 10 interesting sculptures. Also very good for morning jogging - you'll even find some fitness equipment on the way.",
          "La Paz did it right. No highrise hotels blocking the beaches from view. It was a delightful change from Cabo,and San Jose del Cabo where most of the beaches are blocked from view.",
          "We stayed in La Paz for 1week . Every morning we went for a run. It was so great to see so many lo calls out enjoying this place. Sunday night it was more festive with families and others out walking, enjoying the entertainment and venues. A must see in La Paz",
          "We very much liked La Paz and nowhere is better to enjoy the local life than the malec\u00f3n, the place to see and be seen. Great for an evening stroll, a drink watching the sunset, an ice cream or dinner.",
          "It's nice during the day, a well done walkway along the foreshore, but can get a bit hot. But in the evening and night the place comes alive with both locals and tourists. They walk, ride, skate along the Malecon or just sit at one of the many restaurants or bars that line the",
          "Malec\u00f2n translates roughly to \"boardwalk\" and this one extends right alongside La Paz Bay for miles. There are a lot of really fantastic statues and it is incredibly well lit at night. Enjoy watching the boats or stop in and grab some food at the local establishments.",
          "Walking the malecon is a personal favorite of ours....always lively! The sidewalks have been spruced up and the streets widened so that there is more parking at the beginning or south end of the malecon.",
          "The Malecon, or break water, runs for approximately 2 KM along the waterfront of La Paz. Walking paths are nicely constructed ( and under construction at the moment) and there are interesting large scale sculptures every few hundred yards. There are numerous bars, restaurants",
          "We started out as a walk down the Malecon and then rented bikes (which I highly recommend). All the restaurants and shops are on one side and the beach on the other! We've been to several Malecons in Mexico. This is one of the best with the fewest peddlers. You can stroll along",
          "A bit under construction on my visit, but still a nice walk and base to head inland and shop and eat.",
          "Very touristie and commercial. Lots of very loud bars and restaurants that just scream \u201cSpring Break!\u201d- which is not at all what we expected or wanted in La Paz. Reminded me, and not in a good way, of R\u00e9volucion Avenue in Tijuana 20years ago, of of Squid Roe in Cabo every",
          "The people the restaurants the shoreline the seaside sculptures. We spent time there everyday of our trip to La Paz. This is a place I want to visit again and again. Boating marinas, scuba diving shops with a low key feel to it all. Personally, I liked it more than Cabo although",

          "After our tour with VIP LA PAZ - Wonders of the Sea of Cortez, we drove along the Malecon ; so pretty; lots of interesting sculptures; would have been fun to walk around some if we had more time. I felt totally safe and noticed a few truck loads of armed police officers making",
          "LA Paz Malecon keeps getting better and better! They have expanded the walkway and the food along the boardwalk is the best. I went during Carnaval which is celebrating before lent and it was Wonderful! There was a parade every night with floats, carnival rides, 4 music stages",
          "Great first experience of Mexico. Tha Baja Coast, \u201cthe world\u2019s aquarium\u201d and swimming with Whale Sharks. WILD.",
          "The views were great. The weather was perfect. There weren't really things to \"do\" other than a small playground. But the kids loved the long walk in the fresh air.",
          "This bay front boulevard has been upgraded, and offers a variety of restaurants and shopping for over a kilometer. You can select fine dining, or walk safely off the main street a few blocks to enjoy street vendors. La fuente ice cream is amazing!",
          "Walk for miles. Shops, restaurants,whale museum, exercise and play centers. Stay for hours night or day.",
          "Love the Malecon, it has been refurbished and expanded since my last visit, even better than before. Just a nice place to walk and enjoy the view, people, and environment.",
          "Great place to walk. Lots of sculptures. Very clean with lots of shops, bars and restaurants. We were there in February and they had just had a festival so a lot of the stages and food stalls were still there waiting to be taken away.",
          "A great walk all along the water, cannot be beat! The city is clean and the artwork and path are pristine.!",
          "The art work, sculptures and wall paintings is awesome. Great place to walk as far or as little as you want with lots of options for eating, drinking and entertainment. Awesome during carnival (week before Ash Tuesday).",
          "Malecon is a fun walk during the day - restaurants, shops, and bars on one side of the street and the water on the other. Clean sidewalks, lots of photo ops, sculptures every couple of blocks, and cute trashcans (really! They are decorated with sea lions on top so they look like",
          "Long, long promenade with shops, restaurants and a cycle-way. All with a fantastic view over blue water and blue sky.",
          "Pretty walkway along the bay. People work hard at keeping it clean and we saw improvements being made all the time we were there. Driving along it is a bit of a challenge though....can get pretty busy!",
          "This beach could have so much potential but unfortunately the beach is quite dirty and there is lots of construction going on. I would also advise not to swim here...",
          "The Malecon, which has undergone improvements lately, is a lovely way to experience La Paz. Taking a stroll, particularly on a warm evening, is a relaxing way to spend time. There were many local residents no the Malecon in the evening, particularly on Friday evening. There",
          "The city has been working on the boardwalk and it is looking good. A nice place to walk along the water. You can walk, ride a bike or roller blade. Nice place to relax and have a picnic with the family.",
          "With the recent updating of the Malecon this walkway is spacious and well-lit and a huge bonus for this area.",
          "This is where the tourist action begins. Plenty of restaurant options. We enjoyed breakfast on the beach and dinner while watching the promenade. Night transforms this place into a hot spot for bars and clubs. Had options for pop music and pub atmosphere, lots of outdoor patios,",
          "The Malecon is a beautiful stretch along the shoreline. It is now under renovation and should be completed in four months. A great place where families gather at night to enjoy all the fun there.",
          "Visited the Malecon first week of November. Met with a fair bit of construction as the prepared for the busy season to come. A bit of an inconvenience but I was still able to enjoy myself. La Paz is beautiful, and wasn't too touristy- which I really appreatiated. A great",
          "This bulkhead boardwalk is being completed, and is lovely. Frequent artwork sculptures, wide, used by joggers, strollers, skaters. There is a separate bike path on the street adjacent. Attractive addition to the town.",
          "I love strolling the Malecon especially after 5pm. People are skating, biking, running, and laughing, smiling, and waving. It's such a beautiful place to walk before or after dinner. When the construction is complete, I will be so happy!!!",
          "While we were there a couple months ago it looked dated and worn from salt air. Now they are working hard to update and restore. It\u2019s just a nice place to be near the sea and the town. It\u2019s touristy but not overly so with good restaurants and activities but no hecklers trying to",
          "It will be nice when its finished! Currently (Jan 2018) its undergoing some major refurbishment. Nice statues featured along the way. Lovely views and colours at sunset.",
          "It's a nice place for a stroll, a jog, or even to drive by in your car. I would walk it often and it's just a easemt place and it's nice to look at.",
          "Loved walking the Malecon every evening. Beautiful scenery and access to great restaurants and bars.",
          "Well worth spending an afternoin walking the area. Many great bars and restaurants as well as water activities and cultural destinations.",
          "Nice statues along the way, and the view of the water is nice. But when looking for fresh air, I really found that the fumes from the many cars along the busy road really interfered with any sense of fresh air. In fact I almost got a headache from the fumes. There are one or",
          "There's obviously been an effort to beautify this walkway round the bay. It's looking good so far with neat sections and great statues. It just needs to be finished and some seating provided along what might well become the Promenade to compare to The Prado!!",
          "TheMalecon is beautiful and so pleasant to watch families strolling along together very clean ,\ud83d\udca5wonderful sunset , nice whale shark excursion near by. Organic market couple blocks NE Tuesday and Saturday Am\u2764\ufe0f",
          "Be prepared to walk a long way around this malec\u00f3n ;) I believe about 5 or 6 miles walking, maybe more ? But you will enjoy it . Lost of restaurants , but you will find more little stores on the other side of the Main Street , little market, banks and small jewelry fair",
          "Very nicely done seaside boardwalk with bike rentals and walking paths- good restaurants and ice cream- not great for shopping- safe and friendly",
          "Malecon is pretty depressing for a downtown area. First and foremost, there is one good mexican food place in this entire city...no joke, ask anyone. Second, La Paz is supposed to be an \"up and coming\" area, well it still hasn't even gotten up lol. It's legitimately dead. 1/20",
          "I loved walking along the malecon. Great restaurants and shops. Great place to get a coffee or ice cream and sit in the evening to people watch.",

          "There is so much new construction going on down the strip along the Malecon so when it is completed it will be a beautiful walk along the seaside. It is difficult now because of all the construction. There are still a lot of great photo opportunities and the breeze feels great.",

          "Lots of random loud construction all up and down the Malecon. Beautiful unique bronze statues everywhere. Stop at the Corona beer store for a cheap icy cold beer! We would definitely come back to La Paz once all the construction is complete.",

          "The coast along the malecon is absolutely amazing, but the malecon itself is nothing to speak of. The sea being the only reason for visiting La Paz, oh, and the food, the shops etc along the malecon are useless, when you walk it, it's the water you want to see!",
          "La Paz is not the prettiest place, but has a great vibe. The malecon is central to this. The view on the sea, the nice statues and the sunny walk past it all are enjoyable. The people selling tours less so, and the beaches aren't really nice as well.",
          "Such a jewel of the Baja, a must do in LaPaz. Walking along the Malecon in LaPaz at sunset or after is such a wonderful thing.",
          "We didn't end up walking much on the malecon but, did spend a lot of time on the store side which is still opened. Much of the street and sidewalk is being worked on as crews install new pipes, sidewalks, parking areas and wheelchair approaches. They are evidently completing",
          "Did a day trip to LA Paz.. their street are under construction .same as San Jose del Cabo. Walked the Malecon a few blocks it was a very warm day and just need to get out of the heat. With the other side of the street pretty much not walkable. we did not stay very long. But",

          "The Malecon is being upgraded at the moment and so is quite a mess and noisy with the renovations (they seem to work all hours!). However, it is worth the cruise both during the day and evening when there is often a spectacular sunset over the bay. There are some interesting",
          "Major project underway to widen the Malecon and provide more parking. So of course the whole strip is a mess. But they\u2019re moving fast and pouring concrete overnight. They might actually make their December deadline.",
          "We started out walking the Malecon by the 1st pier and stopped by the Marina Hotel. It is a nice walk and the Malecon will be much nicer after all the construction is completed. There is lots to look at and if you are a people watcher you will love it.",
          "We have been to some coastal town all over Mexico, but La Paz is just so special. The Malecon is amazing to experience the real Mexican way of life. On the weekends, this walkway is packed with people, strolling, jogging etc. There is always some sort of event going on,",

          "We enjoyed walking up and down the malecon. This was the heart of the city and all walks of life were walking, biking, roller blading, exercising or just sitting and watching the sun set. Early morning and later in the evening were the best times to be out.",

          "This was the best malecon we visited during our drive along the length of the Baja Peninsula. My wife, myself and our dog found the seaside walk had something different each time we visited. This was a daily destination during our week in the city. Great spot to watch a pick-up",

          "I really did not see anything going on at the Malecon. We drove up for the day from San Jose Del Cabo, I loved San Jose Del Cabo a lot better. Don't get me wrong, the ocean was a sight to see.",
          "Really a hidden gem. By far the largest city in BCS. The waterfront is beautiful, especially the clear waist high water that goes out 300 yards before it reaches 2meters. Great for kids to swim in all day. The offer beautiful art and the famous La Paz sign for Instagrammers.",

          "We were in Cabo and came to La Paz for the day. Once while parked and once driving the Malecon a cop asked to see my driver's license and then made up a fake traffic violation and said they would not give me back my driver's license unless I paid them $100 US dollars. I said I",
          "La Paz doesn't have a lot of 5 star hotels with fancy lounges and pools facing the ocean. No hordes of American tourists looking for excitement .It's buildings are old, and there are no mega nightclubs with deafening music pounding away all night. This is precisely why we",

          "There are much better restaurants in La Paz than along the Malecon, but it's a great place for a stroll along the beach. It's rare in a Mexican tourist area to be able to walk without hustlers bothering you trying to sell time-shares or junky souvenirs.",

          "Hilariously this is one of the very top things \"to do\" in La Paz. Sorry, just don't get it. It's a long walk along the marina next to the road with lots of very odd statues. The other top things \"to do in La Paz\" involve leaving La Paz either by boat or car up the road to one of",
          "Love the malecon and the views of sunset and sunrise, but as the road runs right along it and it's not that wide you are constantly breathing in petrol fumes. You can walk a little further out on various piers and jetties. I still love it.",
          "Lots of great restaurants; clean streets, friendly people. Beautiful view. Nice walking area. No obnoxious salespeople.",
          "This is in central La Paz and along the water. Across the streets are places to shop, eat, or just relax with a beer or cocktail. It is a long street of walkway, but it is kept clean and easy to manage in an afternoon. You can sit and read or think along the way as well.",

          "So we drove from Cabo San Lucas and it was quite the drive. We were just not that impressed with La Paz in general. I'm not sure what I was expecting but it wasn't a big city with a walking path on the edge that is up against the sea. I guess I thought it was going to be more",
          "Walked around for hours. great shops good food. Nice people. seemed really safe. will come back again.",
          "As a place to spend some time walking around this can't be beat. We spent most of a half day walking the Malecon enjoying the sights & flavor of this part of the Baja. If you get tired just cross over for a clod drink at the many restaurants & bars. Pleasant & safe.",

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country.

Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times.

The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines.\nThere are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country. In the year 1964 was a bad year, and it lost the category, playing the next year in the second category, but returning afterwards.The Strongest : Founded in 1908 the club hosts some of its games and trains on their home stadium named Rafael Mendoza after Don Rafael Mendoza, one of the most important presidents of the club. In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts that allowed the team to rise again as one of the most important in the country.\n\nLa Paz F.C. : Founded in 1989, the club quickly rose through the ranks to become the third major club in the capital, only behind in popularity to the two well-established city rivals.The city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:\n\nAcademia de Balompi\u00e9 Boliviano\nAlways Ready\nChaco Petrolero\nClub 31 de Octubre\nDeportivo Municipal de La Paz\nFraternidad Tigres\nMariscal Braun\nUniversitario de La Paz\nClub Uni\u00f3n MaestranzaWith the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Uni\u00f3n Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the Estadio Hernando Siles, which also hosts the national football team and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times. The palace has been restored many times since, but the name has remained untouched.\n\n\n=== Principal attractions ===\n\n\n==== Museums and cultural centers ====\n\nThe former home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, martyr of the independence revolution of 1809, has been preserved and is now a museum.

In March 2012, more than 1.5 million vehicles were registered. Heavy traffic is common in the city center and traffic jams occur on peak hours.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nThe La Paz-El Alto Highway is a toll road that connects the city of La Paz with the neighboring city of El Alto. It is the city's main highway. It allows easy access to El Alto International Airport. The highway runs 11,7 km and crosses the city of El Alto:\n\n Autopista La Paz-El Alto/RN-3 (La Paz-El Alto Highway) - Connects La Paz with El Alto.\n Autov\u00eda La Paz Oruro/A-1 (La Paz-Oruro Highway)  - Connects La Paz with the cities of Oruro, Patacamaya and Caracollo. It then connects with Ruta Nacional 1/RN-1 (National Highway 1) heading south to the cities of Potos\u00ed, Camargo, Tarija.The Southern District, one of La Paz's most affluent and commercial neighborhoods, is relatively separated from the rest of the city, including the CBD. The Avenida Costanera and Avenida Kantutani (Costanera and Kantutani Avenues) connect the southern district with the rest of the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nEl Alto International Airport (IATA code: LPB) is La Paz's national and international airport and a principal hub for L\u00ednea A\u00e9rea Amaszonas and Transporte A\u00e9reo Militar. It also serves as a focus city for Boliviana de Aviaci\u00f3n, Bolivia's flag-carrier and largest airline. The airport is located in the city of El Alto and is (13 km) south-west of La Paz's city center. At an elevation of 4,061 metres (13,323 feet), it is the highest international airport and fifth highest commercial airport in the world. The runway has a length of 4,000 metres (2.5 mi). It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport.\nInternational carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca, LATAM Airlines and Peruvian Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, Santiago and Cusco. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft.\nAirport facilities include ATMs, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, car rentals, duty-free shops, and free Wi-Fi internet. Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines.\nThere are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

          "This rather narrow, short, cobbled street is a must see in La Paz. It gets a bit crowded with tourists, but the colours, the architectural detail and the four museums along the route are all worth seeing. Plus there are artsy shops and places to eat. The museums are closed",
          "An awesome colonial street, still keeps its original house facades, and stone road. Now has museums, bars, touristics shops; Even many people says that this place is haunted, cause has a green cross on one of his walls... And believe me, the best absent on the city...",

          "This is only colonial street in good shape remaining in La Paz. So it is a very special and charming block. Over the years, what used to be just regular houses, is being transformed into touristy shops. Still it has that charm. Full of legends and you can visit at least 5",

          "Soner or later most La Paz visitors walk along Jaen Street. And so should you. The architecture is very interesting--lots of balconies. The shops are plentiful as are the art galleries. People watching is always a good past time, and Jen Street is a good place for it.",
          "This street has lots of interesting architecture and artist shops to visit as you walk along this street. I bought a little carved painted box that was made by a local artist and it is one of my favorite souvenirs!",

          "To be honest this street is a bit overrated I think. We took a photo but outside of that its just a street with a bit of colour. If you really appreciate things like this I'd suggest valparaiso in chile. As for the musuems we specifically wanted to visit them but we had to",

          "This is a very unique little street, very neat and pretty but I'll be honest I much prefer the more interesting streets that criss cross the area of the witches market. La Paz for me was one of the most interesting cities in S. America.",
          "The street itself is quite charming - but it's short and can be done in a few minutes if you're not planning on visiting any of the museums. We had hoped for a decent bar to have a drink, but there was nothing but one dark looking pizza place with plastic chairs there (at least",
          "Arriving mid morning, this historic street was deserted, but bcame busier as midday neared. The museums were interestingbut with no English translations for displays we were left to figure out for ourselves what many artefacts were. The tiny entrance fee meant this really wasn't",

          "We stayed on this street in excellent Hostal Ananay, which was the saving grace. But otherwise it's a set of unremarkable museums - which we didn't feel would have been improved by some more English language or less surly staff. It featured some of the worst art and sculpture",
          "Quaint street but nothing special, full of tedious, dull museums, the street is just like anyother, no idea why it got as many postive reviews.",
          "five museums including the music instrument museum. several little shops selluing artisanat and / or organic quinoa. Sevaral little bars and hostels. Very quiet since it is a pedestrian zone",

          "This street is probably one of the best looking streets in La Paz, we went at midday and were the only ones there. There are museums to visit, and I imagine the street comes alive to those with a guide and more information. Worth a look if you are staying nearby. There are some",
          "Our group did enjoy this this shot and narrow street that provided historical 19th century feel. Street takes you to excellent ethnic museum and nearby plaza.",
          "This is a must visit in La Paz. The Jaen Street is full of museums worth visiting and is a great activity for a nice day in La Paz. I wouldn't go with small children since there aren't many things for them to do (only the Musical Instruments Museum would be suitable for kids)",
          "The Calle Jaen is a small cobbled street a short walk (15 minutes approx) away from Plaza Murrillo. Worth it....very well restored buildings which have tasteful little shops at the bottom opening up onto the windy cobble stoned lane. At the top of the lane there are a number of",
          "Not sure I would make a huge effort to visit. Perhaps we timed it wrong as it was very quiet (Monday lunchtime) with a lot of the shops/museums being closed. Yes, it is quiet and cobbled and quaint but I was expecting a lot more.",
          "It's a very special little street, very different from other areas of the city... I recommend that you go during the afternoon and ask around for the stories of the street.",
          "Nice example of what La Paz use to look like in terms of architecture and cobble streets. The street has some great little art galleries - at reasonable prices. Great spot for a cup of tea or coffee!",
          "the street is what we imagine La Paz was 70 years ago..the museums are great and the cute little stores and cafes around will make a great half a day visit",
          "Worth the trip if for no other reason than being the oldest street. However, it's also very charming, with the intricate balconies being my favorite. Several museums are clustered in the area, and the gallery/shop of Mamani Mamani is close by. I would recommend stopping by",
          "A surprising beautiful restored street that is worth a visit. A lot of museums and small shops, and the best, no traffic!",
          "Short and iconic colonial street in old La Paz historic district. Alost each house over the street is a Museum, some of them as good as the Musical Instruments Museum that charango master musician Ernesto Cavour has build over the years, single-handed and just because of his",

          "Granted, I was usually coming around during the evenings, but surprised to find everything closed, except once one bar was open and the guys were friendly. Should be a hip little street as written up in guidebooks but personally I found it to be dead and disappointing.",

          "For some reason this street is on every \"must-do\" list for La Paz, but for me, (not a HUGE museum guy), it was just your average narrow street in La Paz. I did visit a couple of the museums, such as the museum of Bolivian musical instruments, and grabbed a coffee at Etno",

          "Perhaps there are hidden historic dimensions to this area that I was not aware of, but although pleasant to stroll the cobbled streets, unless you like wandering into small not too gripping \"museums\" there is not too much to hold your attention. But, that said , it makes a calm",

          "I visited on a Sunday so not much was open but it's a gorgeous, clean street that still maintains the classic buidlings from the 19th century. The museums there are nice but not great though they don't cost much. It's a must see in La Paz for cultural purposes.",

          "Increable, all musea are closed for at least one month! This will not help the tourism in thia country. Although the street by it self is very nice and well restored, closing these musea is a complete failure..",

          "For La Paz, the short Spanish-era street is unique, with its lacey iron balconies. However, let's face it, you would not give it a second look in Europe or elsewhere in Latin America. Still it's very nice if you are in the neighbourhood. It would have been GREAT if the museums",
          "A good visit if you have some time left. There are 4 small museums, that you can visit with 1 cheap ticket (10 boliviano's). One of the museums is closed for the moment. Especially the house of Murillo is worthwhile. Photo's are forbidden.",
          "Delightful short pedestrian street with colonial architecture, 5 small museums, and art galleries. However, two of the museums ( the Metals or Oro (gold) museum and the musical instruments museum ) were closed for several months, but its difficult to find this out beforehand.",
          "Quaint little street above the city center. There are five museums located along the street, along with a few shops and cafes. The problem with it is that the four city-run museums keep odd and very short hours - generally opening for just a couple of hours in the morning and",
          "Great to see that the Bolivian government can beautify at least some small part of their city. It may only take 5 minutes to amble down (or up) this street, but it is great to see this restored old colonial street. Their are several cafes and craft shops along its length to add",
          "I went to this street, and it is a lovely street with many interesting museums which are open in the morning, then close, and then open again at 3:00 pm. Unfortunately, we hit the street around 1:00 pm. We walked down the street, and shopped. I especially enjoyed the gallery at",
          "Gold, metal, music, art and others are represented in these museums. One of the most interesting is the building that was once the home of don Pedro Domingo Murillo, a leader in the La Paz Revolution of July 16, 1809, with its displays of period furniture and paintings.",
          "This is a narrow, historic, cobbled street where there is a group of small museums run by the La Paz Municipality. It is very attractive and photogenic with several shops selling artisania. You can buy the entry ticket for the museums in the one on the main road and then visit",
          "This street has colorful colonial buildings with balconies. There are also several museums here which we were unable to visit. The street itself is an attractive enough reminder of a bygone era, just don't expect to be bowled over.",
          "It's so bad that the colonial area in La Paz is pretty much limited to Calle Jaen. The buildings are beautiful, and the area really quite, with nice stores and cafes.",
          "This street is beautiful! We were there on a holiday, so almost nothing was open on the street, but that was almost better. We had the street to ourselves! It looks so picturesque, so beautiful. It's worth going to Jaen Street just to walk down it and see the architecture. What",
          "The well-preserved, quaint, stoned road is a welcome surprise if coming from the big, crowded, noisy boulevards and street markets of the rest of La Paz. At the lower end of the road is an elders' home with sweet folks sitting in the sun and feeding pigeons. The colors of the",

          "Only 3 of the 4 small museums were open when we visited (the gold and silver museum was closed), but it was still fun. The street is lovely with all the charm of the 18th centery. The buildings that the museums are set in were beautiful. The displays looked great, but we had no",
          "Oldest street in town that still looks like the 18th century. Lots of fun pubs like Etno and Boca y Sapo to enjoy the evening. Plus all the museums that concentrate around that area. Really worth a while visiting.",

          "This street is exactly what I was expecting in La Paz. It is small and quaint with some nice souvenir shops. I didn't visit the museums as I had gone quite late in the afternoon. Ended up buying a nice small bag made by an indigenous tribe.",
          "Sure it is not going to take up a whole day, but this is a lovely street to have a coffee, visit a couple of the cute museums and buy some gifts. It was by far my favourite street in La Paz!",

          "4 museums for a ridiculously low price. Each museum is very small, and the exhibitions aren't that interesting. To make things worse, we paid for all 4 museums, even though one of them was closed for renovations. On top of that, in only one museum the explanations were provided",
          "Excellent place to pick up gifts and souvenirs. The Mamani Mamani studio is located at the end of the street. Well worth the trip.",
          "Very pretty street! The four museums there are quite interesting (and cheap to get into) but there really are minuscule. 90 minutes for all four is plenty!",

          "Take a stroll away from the hustle and bustle of the La Paz streets and enjoy the beautiful feel of the cobbled back roads where the mothers hurry along with their children and the locals walking about or sitting outside their homes. We stopped to buy ice cream from a tiny shop",

          "This is a really cool street with a ton of museums. There's a good Pena (a bar with traditional dance and music) there and Etno bar is definitely worth a check for a quiet evening with a couple of drinks. The pena is free to enter and it's not too overpriced, and certainly",

The views of the city are beautiful but it seems like there\u2019s a nursery at the top and it\u2019s gated. Felt a bit awkward edging round about 30 kids to sneak a peak",

          "As La Paz is in a valley surrounded by mountains, Mirador Laikakota is a very good high point to see la Paz from the top and how it extends across the valley. Unfortunately the view is not very spectacular and you cant really see the nicest part of the city that is in the South.",
          "It is not as great as you expect, but still is a place where you have different views from the ity, and you can take pictures of the stadium and downtown. I thought it was better but is just a regular park and you have nothing to loose going there.",

          "Wasn't anything special. Neither the view nor the place itself. Doesn't worth the few bolivianos you pay for the entrance and definitely not your time! From Mirrador Killi Killi or from the telepherique you can enjoy much better views.",

          "This is a great 20-30min walk from the central. It's reasonable steep walking so good for getting use to altitude. Amazing views! Was safe and enjoyable. We did this as a morning run during our week in La Paz.",

          "If you want to see beautiful 360 views of LP, I suggest walking through the park and slowly make your way down the elevated walkway. I walked up through the Miraflores neighborhood and came across the entrance to the Mirador, but was very pleased with the views from the bridge",
          "The thing is, though the views are impressive from inside the park, they're really no better than they are from outside the entrance, and aside from the playground there's nothing to do inside. The route there is along an unusual winding elevated path, and it's a nice walk",

        "wiki": "The arch of Cabo San Lucas, is a distinctive rock formation at the southern tip of Cabo San Lucas, which is itself the extreme southern end of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.  The arch is locally known as \"El Arco,\" which means \"the arch\" in Spanish, or \"Land's End.\"It is here that the Pacific Ocean becomes the Gulf of California.\nThis area is widely used in hotel advertising in the Los Cabos Corridor. This spot is a popular gathering area for sea lions and is frequented by tourists. It is three stories tall and was formed from natural erosion. The Arch of Cabo San Lucas is adjacent to Lovers Beach on the Sea of Cortez side and Divorce Beach on the rougher Pacific Ocean side. The Arch is accessible by land if you approach it by placing yourself at the beach of the last hotel on the Pacific ( Finisterra )\nYou will have to climb some big rocks, once you do that, you will be at the very tip of the peninsula and a few steps from El arco.Basement rock in Los Cabos formed through intrusive igneous processes c. 115 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period.\n \n\n\n== References ==",

          "It probably doesn't matter which boat tour you book as most will do the same but I can definitely recommend a short trip out to El Arco. You'll most likely stop on a few things on the way out there and it's nice to see El Arco close up. Most likely, you can also spend some time",

The trip there and back was a bit chilly, couldn\u2019t really be on the deck of the ship swimming in the pool, hot tubs were packed so couldn\u2019t do that either. If you like cruises, inside",

          "If your entering or leaving, make sure you get as close as safe to take in the view and hear the waves. Both sides are different so make the extra trip",
          "I suggest going on a sunset cruise. There are several. You can go on a rough Boose cruise, a Jazz and wine cruise or the Caboray. It depends on what kind of cruise you are looking for. The wine and Jazz cruise is nice and if there is enough wind, they open up the sails on the",
          "El Arco is definitely worth a visit. It is special to be at the point where the Pacific ocean meets the Sea of Cortez. Go by boat or kayak - its a great experience",

          "The Arch at Cabo Lands End I heard was the most photographed in the world. Even if not true it is always beautiful. If you are on a cruise ship and on the port side of the ship be on deck or on your balcony when your ship approaches Cabo. You will get great shots of the arch",
          "We got punga out from the marina which went out to the el arco, barter with them to get a good price. The scenery was just amazing, sea lions resting on rocks, divorce beach, beautiful clear waters, there are lots of boats that go out there, and it can get a bit congested at",
          "You cannot miss seeing Los Arcos, if you get up early in the morning, it's one wonder of the world to view. Get a Panga and head over there, it's another planet. Beautiful, but very dangerous if you don't follow boating, diving or fishing rules. Respect the waters and beach,",
          "It was very difficult to get on and off the boat as the Medino Beach has very strong waves. I had to have about 4 or 5 people help me on and off. However, once on the boat, it was amazing! I saw many colorful fish, seals on the rocks, pelicans in the water, and the area where",

          "We got to see the beautiful arch on two occasions, once when we went on the Cabo Escape Sunset Cruise, and again when we hired a water taxi to go to Lover's Beach. On both occasions, we saw the arch from both the Sea of Cortes side and from the Pacific Ocean side. The views",
          "We did the water taxi twice, The information you get from drivers is different but all very good. The trip is about 40 mins there and back and 1st time we wasn\u2019t offered to go to lovers beach. But 2nd time we did. No point trying to get a glass bottle as only a small",

          "This is one of the many \"tourist\" junkets that you will be sold on your trip here. But it is still worth taking. Many different varieties and no doubt prices will be available so be aware of that. It is a lovely trip for seeing the coastline and development of Cabo San Lucas",
          "We took a cruise and dinner to see El Arco , the tour last two hours just zigzagging the bay , pretty much seeing the same thing over and over The live band was really good but unfortunately the people on board were or either to old or to bore to dance The shows were very nice",

          "Cmon, how often are you going to be that close to something unique like this? It costs very little to have a water taxi take you out to look at the rock formations up close, the pretty little beaches, and the small sea lion colony. Stick a fork in your wallet and have a fun",

          "I took a glass bottom boat to the arch and stayed at the beach for about 90 minutes. One of the few highlights on this otherwise tacky town. Don't get me wrong, Cabo has so much natural beauty but the tourist area is tacky as hell and is overrun with Americans.",
          "Ran into Mario as we were leaving the cool of the Paradiso shopping Centre. I was a bit dubious by being approached in the street. Not to fear we joined a small group of Spanish speakers on the El Ejefe and headed out to lands end. Heaps to see and although there were lots of",

          "I have been to Cabo San Lucas 12 times now and each time I snap hundreds of photos of the Arch and rocks at Lands End. Each time I discover some new detail about this venue. And I never tire of it. I recommend doing a sunset dinner cruise that sails around the arch at sundown.",
          "We had a group of about 15 that went, we all enjoyed the snorkeling and the views. A few got sea sick so we asked to head back to the marina area early. We got out and swam in by the beach for a bit before heading back. They were extremely accommodating and helpful! Great",
          "This popular site is gorgeous for photos but I would take them from a chartered boat and not attempt to actually go onto the beach. Although it looks tempting to visit, trying to get from the sea of Cortez side to the Pacific side is quite dangerous. I did not attempt to do this",

          "The Arches are a classic Cabo attraction but definitely watch out for high surf. We are beach people, very comfortable in the water and the warning of rough surf is strong. If you have notions of your Feet in the ocean as you stroll down Lovers beach - you may be disappointed.",
          "The most economical way to see the Arco is by water taxi. If you paid more than US$20 person, you paid too much. Try to book your taxi from your concierge at your hotel. If you book from one of the taxi peddlers off the marina at Cabos San Lucas, negotiate hard to get it back to",

          "This is well worth a visit and I recommend a tour. The structure is fascinating as is the history of this residence. The roof tiles are incredible. Shaped on the thighs of the men working on the roof. Quite amazing.",
          "It's a really impressive church. If you get a tour you'll appreciate it a lot more. If you get the chance go to the top of the bell tower for amazing views of the city",
          "The church is nice and relatively big. It is located in the centre of La Paz, easily reachable on foot. Note that you are not allowed to take pictures inside, like in most churches in Bolivia.",
          "I really wanted to visit this church and was certainly not disappointed. We went to visit the museum and considered not when we had to pay admission. What a great decision to continue. We didn't really get it- but we were assigned a guide who spoke English- who took us on a very",

          "The exterior really is the main show here ... It\u2019s pretty bland (for a Catholic Church!) inside but worth sticking your nose in. Some of the side alters are clearly very popular with locals ... adorned in flowers and people queuing to pray.",
          "This church and the history are amazing (and I'm not usually a huge church person when traveling). the tour was very cheap, and you get to know the history of the church and some of La Paz, and get to go on the roof for amazing views. I highly recommend taking the tour!",
          "A beautiful old church with an always busy square artists, vendors, comedians, travelers, locals... everyone. Interesting place to relax with some fresh popcorn or coconut water while you take in the sites, sounds and smells of La Paz.",
          "The collection itself boasts some rather interesting examples of religious painting, but you don\u2019t really get to enjoy them as the museum\u2019s administration is ridiculously overprotective. Not only you are not allowed to take photos with or without flash (which I can totally",
          "This beautiful church is the heart of La Paz, and inside you can find many treasures that tell the story of the Pace\u00f1os and how the religiosas dirt intruded by the Spaniards... there is a cool story how they used mirrors to trap the souls of the natives... The facade is also a",
          "It's a nice cathedral and well worth stopping by if in the area. When we were there it seemed the hours were a little variable.",
          "My wife and I had a great time in the Plaza del Armas area of Lapaz and visited this church, a wonderful experience. Very well preserved, and a local treasure for sure.",
          "Even if you are not inside the structure and the history about it, is something that you can not forget from inside is so quiet and the smell of old church is unreal, the people preying and getting some spiritual connection is something that it's not so common to find. Special",
          "Very impressive and thoughtfully build. Could walk in for free and enjoy the darkness and peace of this place. The place in front is very busy.",
          "I went to visit the museum and the church. The museum is 20 bolivianos but you get a priv\u00e9 guided tour and a great rooftop view on top of the church! My guide was super lovely and not only did we talk about the museum and the church, also about Bolivia in general and she was",
          "This will be a quick review. This place is only good for pictures. They have Some spots that make for good pictures. The cost is and very much about 20 Bolivianos or about 3 US dollars. I\u2019ve taken the tour three times because I had some visitors that wanted to see it. The guides",
          "Nothing spectacular compared to some south American cathedrals or churches but still another good example",
          "During the guided tour for about an hour & 15 minutes (a \"compulsory one\" but one where I was assigned a guide right away after entering without having to wait for other people), I did get to see: the \"original remains\" underneath seen through glass along the corridor on one",

          "Five days in and around town. We did not have time to get into the church and / or the museum. We only saw the church from outside and all of its sculptures indigenous and not so sacred, we loved it.",
          "The church is situated at the San Francisco Square, which is usually full of people, so be careful. The church itself is worth a visit, although it is quite lugubrious inside.",
          "Now we avoid this square. Crowded, filthy, hard to walk on sidewalks because of the many vendor, and pick pockets. The food and stuff being sold is disgustingly dirty. Garbage is simply tossed on the street.",
          "Another one of those ridiculous relics of the spanish invasion and suppression of a strong group of cultures. That aside, the building isamarelof constructin and architectural skills and definitely worth a visit.",
          "Went here as part of an organised full day tour with Transturin. Beautiful Spanish style church in the middle of a very busy part of town. Lots of beautiful paintings inside. Worth a visit if in La Paz",
          "It was a good place for some history about Bolivia and the construction of the most beautiful Church that I visited in Bolivia. The best part it's to feel the cold air around the back. The sad part is that we couldn't took some pictures of this beautiful place.",
          "There is no charge just walk in. The church is extremely ornate with golden altars and paintings and statuary everywhere. It is a basilica and is, I believe, the oldest church in La Paz dating back to the middle of the 16th centuries. Founded by the Franciscan order. Next",
          "The entrance fee is 15bs with a private guided tour (mandatory). The guide we had didn\u2019t speak good enough English for us to understand the places and keep rushing us to the next spot. The museum and the church has quite a few different rooms and art gallery with brief",
          "Really nice place. We paid 15bs and the guide was included. We got a lot of informations and felt comfortable with our authentic and nice guide.",
          "This old church is a solid addition to the spirit of La Paz. While the outside is not especially compelling, the inside is highly ornate with many intricate golden carvings around pictures of holy persons. There was a mass in progress while I was there and I was impressed by the",
          "Very nice inside architecture, also nice facade with a mix of indigenos and conqueror symbols. A bit tricky to visit on a Sunday as there are a lot of services. Even, worth to sit in, have a quite moment and look around the paintings, the gold foil decorated ornaments.",
          "It's worth it to come in and see the church while it's open. Very pretty and huge. It's only open during Mass, so entering and sitting quietly recommend",
          "Before going in the church we took a tour of the adjoining monastery. This was most interesting and very informative. We were shown models of the monastery both before and after alterations that cut the size of one of the quadrangle. You have to go on a tour to access the",
          "This iconic church is a place of refuge from a crowded square in front of it. The wall-to-wall main altar is a riot of gold with an assortment of uniquely Bolivian santos. The church also boasts La Paz's best rooftop view which is only accessible if you buy a ticket to the",
          "The architecture of this church is very interesting in that it combined religious Catholic statues alongside indigenous symbols. For a small charge you can walk up to the top of the bell tower for a great view of the city.",
          "This was the starting point of our walking tour. The outside is more impressive than the interior. 10 mins inside was more than enough time to look round.",
          "Nice and interesting for a short visit. Not so different from many other churches nd cathedrals in South America. Visit if within walking distance or a short cab ride, but not worth a long trip just to visit this place.",
          "Interesting church to have a look at. It is useful to get a guide to help you understand and appreciate some of the intricacies and stories behind the building, as well as how the religious developed. Follow my #30somethinggapyear on Instagram @DatLoongJourney.",
          "When you visit a foreign city, particularly like somewhere in Central or South America, there are a certain number of buildings to see - palaces, government buildings, cathedrals, etc. This is one of those in La Paz. St Francis seems to be a popular saint in this neck of the",
          "Although you don't get to stand in the actual sanctuary, you do see a lot of the church and the surrounding buildings. Don't miss a visit to the bell tower and roof, if you don't mind narrow passageways.",
          "The truth is difficult to contemplate in its entirety. The structure is made of stone and its history is worth remembering. If you are wearing a hat",
          "Entry ticket included a guide, however you might get a uni student whose English is not very fluent. Interesting history of the cathedral and Franciscan monks. Worth climbing up the steep narrow staircase to the bell towers that offers nice view of surrounding and interesting",
          "My husband and I visited the museum attached to the church as our first stop in La Paz. I can't remember the cost, but I know it was low. The rooms in the convent contained paintings and historical information (all in Spanish). There was no one to offer a tour in English,",
          "well worth a stroll through to see the beautiful main and side altars. Was reverent and respectful as Mass was being celebrated. Obviously not as opulent as the churches and cathedrals in Europe.",
          "We've taken an English tour of the church. The lady is an extremely experienced one who can manage to show us all important features of the church in a 40 minutes tour. However, the tour is a bit too short and we think it should take 1.5 hour to finish reading all those",
          "The museum offers many rooms with detailed explanations of the history of the building & the Spanish influence in La Paz.",
          "An artistic and architectural jewel. Incredible structure in the city. Good memories in adjacent stores.",
          "Is one of the the principal churches in lapaz and a really enjoyed the place the museum is great! With guides, nice place to go for small history.",
          "Originally founded in 1548 as the Convent of San Francisco followed by the church in 1549. Rebuilt in the mid 1750s the current baroque mestizo style church still stands and is a minor basilica. For a reasonable entrance fee, I received an individualized and comprehensive tour",
          "The Church is beautiful, but when we went on a tour (20 b) we didn\u2019t learn anything due to a stressed guide. But if you\u2019re happy with just the interior- go!",
          "Very interesting temple, outside amazing figure ( people , dragons animals , plants) old door , baroque style. Inside simply with many altars on the right and left sides. Photo - prohibited .",
          "When we purchased tickets the staff said there would be English guide available, but when we walked up the stairs to start the tour, the staff there said there won't be any English guide. We walked by ourselves for a while until we bumped into a group of German tourists being",
          "Sadly no photos but this building is very different to the cathedral which is mord in European style. The altar is gold replica. A huge full wall. There are statues and paintings in the native style and as our guide indicated represents a polytheistic belief system totally",
          "This is well worth a visit, it has a lovely peaceful atmosphere and is a beautiful building. Shame about the hideous tower blocks all around it.",
          "We visited Iglesias de San Francisco and were in absolute awe. Very well preserved and full of historic items thoughtful displayed. It was like a walk back through time. We would highly recommend visiting this Historic Site in La Paz. Well worth the time and money spent. Easy to",
          "When I arrived at the church, early afternoon, I was told it was not open to the public until 6:00 PM. However, the church museum was open and admission is cheap. I was accompanied by an English speaking guide (although her command of English was rather rudimentary). I climbed",
          "Very old rustic church, absolutely breathtaking on the inside well worth a visit. The day we visited it was decorated with hundreds of flowers!",
          "I\u2019m not catholic, but I can appreciate all the fantastic structures they have built and this one is impressive. Be warned, you are not supposed to take pictures inside . . . Oops! I didn\u2019t see the sign until we were on our way out.",
          "We passed by on the Saturday but it was closed only the museum was open, we did pass by again on Sunday and we were able to catch a mass which was very touching The church itself was very pretty.",
          "Watch for pickpockets, but it is an interesting structure to visit. Lots of people congregate in the general area.",
          "The outside is a reminder of Spanish colonialism and the architecture exquisite. It's not opulent like what I saw in Italy but it's massive and simple in structure. Inside it's a very much a daily practicing church where local devotees spend much time. Very very cool. It's",
          "The church is not as impressive as its counterpart in Lima, but the tours provide great insights and take you up the bell tower. The guide we had spoke french, and was very knowledgeable. It is even amazing to see that there are still monks living there",
          "We went for the Sunday mass, goes on every hour 7:00 to 11:00 AM. Unfortunately the guides only works Monday to Saturday, we will like to know more about the history. Even with aren't in too a mass worth the visit to see the Spanish conquers power.",
          "It's a toss up as to whether the cathedral of the San Francisco church is the more stunning highlight of La Paz. The SF church is more accessible in terms of opening times, but photography is completely forbidden inside. The architecture isn't as impressive as the cathedral, but",
          "Visting the church after 1600 is free and one can take a leisurely look around the stunning interior bearing in mind that photographs are strictly prohibited. The craftsmanship and dedication that has created the carvings and facade are staggeringly good. To view the monastery",
          "This is arguably the most famous Plaza in La Paz. It's nice, but not impressive when compared to many of the famous plazas of the world. I certainly would not go out of my way to visit this place. But if you're in La Paz and have some free time, it's probably worth stopping",
          "Once you enter to the Musuem you start to like it, the guide was very nice and helpfull!!! The paintings are beautiful!!!",
          "The tour is good, and they have tour guides that do it in English. A tour of about 30 minutes. A little expensive bit worth it if you don't mind being bossed around for that length of time.",
          "If you're staying near the church of San Francisco this is a good place to plan your day after breakfast while people watching.",
          "I usually don't go to churches but I was there with my father and, beside he goes to church, we needed a place to rest! Lol We got there at the end of the Sunday worship and it was nice. They had a choir and people were singing and actively participating. I was raised as",
          "Went in to church on a Sunday as it was the only day it was open while I was in town, managed to attend mass which was interesting in itself",
          "The church is beautiful and worth a visit. The city square there is very popular. The mime clown is fun, as well as the Michael Jackson impersonator. Lots of actives and vendors. Great area.",
          "You can't miss this church; it is the epicenter of the city. Lots of people and activity. Church is unique example of baroque mestizo style.",
          "Nice old church that seemed to be the center of local activity. There are lots of vendors in the area",
          "Unusual church blending the county's cultural traditions both inside and out but especially on the fa\u00e7ade. If not to everyone's taste, full of interest and well worth a brief visit.",
          "We enjoyed an English speaking guided tour through this incredibly historical building and got a nice view of the main square. The tour takes you through tight stairways and if you're lucky, to the script. Fantastic way to spend an hour.",
          "Good way to spend about hour our guide juan alegandro made the tour very interesting and was free as part of the entry fee worth a visit",
          "The Church can be visited by simply entering it, when it is open, but the adjacent museum enables the visitor to see its Franciscan Convent as well as the Bell Tower and various other nooks of the complex. The Mestizo Baroque architecture is of special interest",
          "We really enjoyed this tour of the cathedral. The church is very old and since it was built clergy have lived here (still do). There and a few rooms where you really sense how it might have been to live here 300 years ago - and how oppressive the colonial morality was. We had",
          "The building is a real gem. My only complaint is that you can only wander around as part of a guided tour, and our guide pushed us through at a brisk pace. I would have liked to take more time. I presume the tour is due to the meandering nature of the building. Parts are closed",
          "The church is beautiful inside and out, it was very touching to be there during a mass and hear the voices raised in song filling the space, I'd go back to lion around more as I didn't like to during worship. The museum however is a disappointment - it costs 20bol to get in, a",
          "The english guide on the museum.. Oh dear lord! Well, he didn't speak good English, I didn't mind that but he was so scared and embarrassed about that so he practically ran the place through and on the way just pointed up the objects and said a few words about them. The",
          "The museum and the church are definitely worth a visit. The church is not accesible at all times of the day but if it's open it's worth a visit to see the beautiful altar and have a look at the crypts.",
          "Located at the crossing of Sagarnaga and Murillo streets, in the back of the plaza with the same name, Iglesia de San Francisco is perhaps the oldest in the country. Construction started in 1548, before the founding of the city of La Paz, it then collapsed in 1612 and built",
          "Well worth the visit. It's a beautiful church measuring up to those in Europe. The detailing on both the interior and exterior is incredible",
          "Make your way here and then head off up the many laneways and explore the old City . The Church has lots of activity outside as well as the usual views inside",
          "The architrcture is a combination of european and indiginous...so it is a beautiful unique church...no doubt But whats more excited are activities at the front...such as chess tables and street concert",
          "One of the Most Important buildings in La Paz and a unique architecture and facade-decoration! Note the floral motives and the inca-faces there! And never forget to say a prayer for the Peoples of Bolivia!",
          "This is a historic church built upon the peace between the rich spaniards and mestizos and the poor indigens The church is nice and classical; however it has been partially restored and in the process some of the charm went away to be replaced by glitterness",
          "This is a really lovely church in the middle of crazy and busy La Paz - worth a visit even if you're not catholic or religious.",
          "The monastery is interesting to visit and there is a nice view from the roof and bell towers. The guided tour provided only basic information and was only in Spanish though they do have alternate tours in English. The information delivered was pretty basic though, and provided",
          "Nice church on a busy square where everyone tries to sell anything. Very close to the touristic Sganaga street.",
          "Me and my friend are Australian and we visited this church today and not only did Daniel fill us with knowledge we had a good laugh together highly recommend for a fantastic experience! Muchas gracias Daniel & San Francisco!! Two proper legends",
          "Beautiful building and a lovely town square adjacent. Exterior architecture is stunning, the solemn dark interior is incredibly interesting. Worth a 30 minute stop.",
          "Cool place to visit, I must for all those visiting La Paz. Here you will see the San Francisco Church, loved the architecture of this church with Mestizo and Baroque influences.",
          "A busy square where everyone collects. Watch your valuables. Church is old and great to take photos of.",
          "You won't believe there is a place hidden in the middle of such trafic noise. San Francisco Church and Museum is worth to visit. There are guided tours and is cheap. You can visit the church and museum just in 30 minutes and climb until the bell tower to enjoy a beautifull",
          "La Paz' oldest church and convent, if I'm not mistaken. Beautiful mestizo decorations on the front and the altar. Also have a look at the museum and the rooftop walk is not to be missed.",
          "Don't miss this attraction. Take your time in the church. The inside of the church might be frightening to young children. My son did find the decorations scary but this is a must see in La Paz.",
          "What a fantastic example of baroque in America. The altares and pulpits are beautiful! You should not miss this place!",
          "It is a gorgeous Church, the architecture and design is very intriguing and appeals to all. The only thing is that on week days they open at 4;00PM, but other than than, well worth it",
          "The best way to see the church is taking the museum tour. The church is more than just a church it's a convent. In old times it used to be a larger convent to which lay people where not allowed.. Now you can see parts of it. The climb to the roof is worth it! Enjoy",
          "For 20Bs you get a guided tour in either English or Spanish, this lasts approx 45 mins so good for teenagers with a short attention span! You get to see around the monastery and the highlight (literally) would be the view from the church rooftop overlooking the city. The access",
          "Besides the church, the huge space in front is a central gathering for many events in the city. In fact, the entire time we stayed here, every night there was a band playing and the plaza is so crowded. Back to the church, it is located in the Sagarnaga area. The",
          "Tours are available every day of the week besides Sunday for 20 Bs. This grants you entrance and also a tour guide. I went alone, and they didn't even make me wait. I got a personal tour. They offer English and Spanish (maybe others but those were the only ones they offered me).",
          "Great spot to be at. The markets start from here, the mall is across the street and the street vendors...we'll some of the best in La Paz.",
          "Located west of El Prado. Founded in 1548. The facade is decorated with stone carvings of chirimoyas, pinecones and tropical birds. It is just a lovely church and when you go inside you can feel at peace and get the feel of how many Bolivians are devoted Catholics.",
          "The church was certainly built on a grand scale and while the Italian marble flooring is opulent the rest is not as ornate as other churches such as in Cusco etc. It's free to get in so worth a quick look if you're passing.",
          "Our guide spoke good English and took great interest in his job. The church is quite amazing. No photos allowed inside but that only cemented the experience for me.",
          "There was a lot of history behind this church, and it is beautifully maintained. Our tour guide was young, but knowledgeable, and we enjoyed our time here. We went on a weekday during the day and ended up being there the same time as some local schools were doing tours, but our",
          "This is a must! We visited the church with an English guide, a very knowledgeable social science student who guaranteed that we got all historical information. The site with the first column of the church in 1549 was impressive, also the visit to the roof top with bells!",
          "Loved the tour, I was guided by a charming young lady that explained everything and I was very impressed. Very nice little tour.",
          "The buildings are amazing, but it was the guide who made it special. A young woman named Helen who spoke excellent English explained the allegorical meanings of the paintings to me in a way that unlocked them for me -- I should add I've been to dozens of galleries all over the",
          "We enjoyed the life and vivacity on the plaza outside of the church. The guide gave us an interesting accounting of the church's start and the early days of Catholocism in Bolivia",
          "This church was founded in 1543 and has a lot of history. There two kinds of tours. The museum tour that takes you up to the bell tower and the church tour. I took the museum tour and was able to take some breath taking pics. Watch you step because the floor and steps are",
          "We didn't have a plan on what to do after returning from Tiwanaku, so we decided to pop in and see the church. It was a beautiful place to visit! The tour guides (free of charge) were great and very knowledgeable, the architecture is beautiful and history of the place is great.",
          "This is one of the most beautiful churches I have ever visited in Bolivia. It is a real historical treasure with a breathtaking architectural baroque style! The interior of the building looks expansive and the \"retablos\" are immensely rich and ornamented; not to mention the",
          "We didn't go inside because it didn't look open. All the locals were sitting in front of the doors. It's a marvellous building to look at from outside anyway. The plaza is a great place to people watch. There is also a huge souvenir market behind and a huge food market in the",
          "Wonderful Colonial Church in La Paz with a crypt beneath the basilica, have a museum in the colonial convent",
          "The church was OK and the convent beside it, nicer. The guide who showed it was not really friendly, She just pointed out four times that 'if by accident you make one of the bells ring you should pay a big fine of 1000 BOV'.",
          "A very building housing an imposing Cathedral of a neo classical style and not the common Baroc style found by most Catholic churches. The building with beautiful Greek style columns is plane but respectfull surrounded by wonderful stained glass made in Italy. The Cathedral was",
          "the church is located in the central plaza. The inside is beautiful with large ceilings and beautiful stained glass",
          "Right in down-town stands this church, the visit includes a tour to the SF monatesry/museum and the temple. My favorite part is to go up to the roof and see the city from there.",
          "Very interesting church in the center of La Paz. I found that La Paz does not have that many exciting places to visit so this one is a must. Like most churches in southern America this one is richly decorated and the main altar is spectacular and do are the side altars.",
          "This is a great place to visit and soak up the history. It's very crowded outside and can be loaded full of tourists. Be careful with your belongings. Read up on the history of this amazing church and the area as well is full of rich history - far away and recent history as",
          "Glamorous, rich, splendid ... There are not too many places in La Paz that deserve a visit, this one definitely does. Decorated in the typical ostentatious manner this is a fantastic place to visit. The main altar is spectacular, much like the ones seen in churches in Peru.",
          "I had been in La paz three times before i finally visited this magnificent gem in the heart of the city. the tour was cheap and well coordinated with excellent hosts that even spoke English. Very impressive service for such a cheap tour. The building and all the paintings are",
          "This was an important church in the history of Bolivia and a visit is a very worthwhile experience. The cost is a paltry. 20 Bolivianos and includes a guided tour. We wandered about reading the English postings but joined a tour which took us to some places we could not access",
          "The church in the middle of the city is Iglesia de San Francisco. Although the building itself is quite old and very impressive, I found the surrounding area to be much more interesting. Up the side street of the church is where you will find all the street vendors selling",
          "Gloria was our tour guide. Great!! Tour was in Spanish, but I understand there is an English option. Very interesting tour with great works of art, then a visit to the top of the church for a birds eye view and a behind the scenes look at the running of the church. So much",
          "Right from the intricate facade and into the church itself...one cannot but go back to the time when this was built, Spanish conquistadores laying what they must have seen a magnificent relic of christianity on South American soil, very rich in design and lavish in gold.",
          "So much colour, a Bolivian flavour of the Catholic faith with strong Spanish roots. A mass started about 10 minutes after we arrived so we did curtail our visit somewhat, but we did enjoy the colourful interior & the facade even more.",
          "The church is a great example of mestizo-baroque. Building and artworks from indigenous people and Spanish colonisers. The adjoining museum is well worth the visit. You can climb to have a great view of the elaborate roofs and tiles and to watch Pace\u00f1os from above on their day",

          "Many people hang out outside this church, people sitting on the footsteps of the church, either talking or eating or just resting. Quite an interesting site for me. I guess even the outside of the church bring some kind of comfort and rest. The inside of the church is amazing. I",

          "Very impressive Spanish style church that is a historic location in the city of La Paz. Sorry no pictures inside, but comeback at night for the free public shows and entertainment outside the church.",
          "The museum basically consists of two rooms, one that explains the story of settlement and the other shows the old brewing equipment. The savior for our 20bs each was access to the roof of the church. Looking down into the church from the upper level was good and then using some",
          "Really interesting Franciscan monastery and church-they have tours in English and Spanish. A lot of history, art and architecture to enjoy.",

          "A historic church at the upper end of El Prado (main street in La Paz), in Plaza San Francisco, first built in 16th century, rebuilt in 18th century. You can go in church for free, and visit the museum for 20 Bolivianos (about \u00a32), where they take you on a tour of the cloisters",
          "We took the tour for 20 bol each, and it includes a guide. The guide was the worst we ever had in our lives. He could not answer any of our questions... Basically you have to follow him, and listen to his explanations, which he learned, but don't be curious you will never get",
          "You can visit the church itself without paying for a tour, and it is quite beautiful on its own. The architecture is very unique with many indigenous touches. However I would recommend that you pay for a tour at the museum next door. It cost us only 20 bolivianos and we were",
          "With nothing to do in the city at the time I paid the entrance fee and didn't expect much. The church is so so beautiful and there's so many rooms to explore. Gorgeous courtyard outside with a garden and fountain. Once you get onto the top roof you have an amazing view of the",

          "I'd say it's just another church. I was there when the pope visited and the area was quite animated. I prefered the plaza in front of the church to the church itself. This area of La Paz is quite touristical, but It's nice.",
          "It's quite a beautiful church! I was lucky enough to be there during \"Semana Santa\". So there was plenty of activities outside the church. This also meant learning about the history regarding the church without taking the tour. I didn't take the tour this time I visited but I",

          "Nice, but I didn't think it was that special or that it stood out from other churches. Still, the area around it is extremely lively - there are tour agencies, a market, accommodation, etc. that make it a good place to visit.",
          "It is a very good place/ historic site to visit. It is right at the historic central part of La Paz. We love visiting historic sites and this one was very good and we really enjoyed visiting the whole of La Paz city",
          "We have visited a lot if chr he's and whilst it does get a little repetitive, this one is pretty good. We got the free tour with our entry (but slipped a small tip to our guide) and we felt this was a nice way to learn about some if the history, and also be taken up the bell",

          "The San Francisco church as it stands today is built on the site of an earlier one which was destroyed during a massive snowstorm that collapsed the building. The tour includes access to the bell tower. English speaking guides are available, though they are provided gratis",
          "San Francisco is a central spot with lots of activities. Nice place to people watch. We had no problems but do get local advice on safety if you'll be there late in the evenings or at night.",
          "I came to the church in the evening towards the end of a service. I only had about 20 minutes inside so we quickly made a round and ended up seeing most of the statues displayed. The day must have been quite sacred beause there was this little candle filled room that people",
          "The church itself is big and is nice to see all the people around it, when I went for the first time there was a graduation going on and it was cool to see the locals there celebrating however the church itself is nothing extra special in terms of architecture or internal",
          "The Church is quite impressive all though a lot smaller than I was expecting. Next door there is a museum with a wide collection of art that was pretty good. I actually preferred the Basilica further up the road.",
          "Really like how the church makes a real effort to educate people on the history of la paz and the region as you tour through the church. They have signs in English, spanish, and French so you know exactly what you're looking at. Definitely go to the bell tower to look out over",
          "Nice place to vista for an afternoon if you get stuck out in the rain. Some nice architecture, gives a brief history of La Paz and has some very nice art work.",

          "This church is on a busy street around the corner from the Witch's market. The streets are full of people and there are definitely people harassing foreigners for money. One followed my husband and I so closely and didn't take no for an answer that we eventually paid him to",
          "Maybe the most beautiful structure in La Paz Nice location but be extremely careful as the place is notorious for thieves and pickpockets. Don't go alone but do go. Food in street good and reasonable",
          "A stunning building in the centre of La Paz where you can sit for hours on the steps and watch the locals go about their business. It really was an amazing spot to people watch.",
          "Very impresive church. It\u00b4s a nice place to hang (outside of course), lots of street artists do their shows at the square in front of the church...",
          "We paid our 20 bobs each not knowing what to expect. The church is immense and OTT which had been our experience in most of Bolivia and Peru. You are able to climb up onto the roof via very narrow staircases. This affords views across the rooftops and to the courtyards below.",
          "It is a good place to tour through and you can even go the the roof for a good view of the city. Good history of the city from the colonial view point.",
          "Watched from far = Amazing... Getting inside = Interesting!!. Personally i recomend to visit the church for a little tour, depending of the guide you will just leave the place amazed or with a lot of ( ??? ). I recomend to visit it at morning when you can go up to the bell tower",
          "San Francisco was part of the original hub of La Paz. The church itself isn't as spectacular as other cathedrals, but is a worthwhile visit for the historical significance. For 20Bs you can go through the museum with a guide. Be sure to ask to go to the roof if it isn't",
          "Here is my review of the museum It costs 20 bolivianos and this comes with a Spanish guide, no English. The museum includes the old church. What I like Very spacious English text on the museum pieces Access to church roof and tower Upper view of the church Centrally located",
          "must visit the museum inside and also the main hall, in the courtyard there are usually activities and free walks during the day",
          "... this cathedral does not compare to the European ones. But there is enough to see with nice decorations, so there will be no regrets visiting the church if it's the first one you see. If it's not and you've had your fill of the dolls representing saints/JMJ, no worries",
          "I went to the Sunday mass.. It was in Spanish which I enjoyed. But they also have English mass. The structure of the church is breath taking there's also history of the church in front. Enjoy",
          "San Francisco Cathedral is an Icon in the La Paz, Original Colonial, the lights make it ever more beautiful at night. I LOVE the typical folkloric stores in Calle Sagarnaga next to the Cathedral. A Must visit place and shop.",
          "San francisco's church is located in the touristic area of La Paz's downtown right beside Sagarnaga street. It has a colonial/franciscan style and a big square in front of it, where there are frequent public artistic presentations.",
          "As with many cathedrals around the world, it's going to look beautiful inside and have interesting architecture outside. The Museum is one of those \"must-do\" things in La Paz, so do it.",
          "Beautifull church with great architecture and beautiful wood carvings. have a seat and watch the locals pray and worship.",
          "Very beautiful it's worth visiting it when u are in La Paz! Make sure u go to the restaurant in front it has an amazing view of it",
          "The church was near my hotel so I visited it for an hour one morning. There was hardly anyone there so I was able to take my time. You can't take pictures inside, otherwise I'd have recorded the wine barrels for making wine and pisco! Staff was friendly enough, I had a janitor",
          "I'll begin by saying that I'm not a huge fan of museums to begin with, but I wasn't super impressed with the tour or the tour guide that comes with the 20 boliviano entry fee. You're mainly looking at paintings, which all have descriptions, so I'd personally rather just go at my",
          "This is pretty much the heart of La PAz, and the square to the front is probably the best spot to enjoy the rich hubbub of local life. there are often musical, cultural events held there, and its a great location to head out from to all areas of the surrounding city too. Same",
          "A lovely plain stone church with extraordinary carvings on the east portal and the high altar. I was sorry that the museum was not open on any of the 4 days that we stayed nearby.",
          "They have a guided tour where you can go up the bell tower and have a nice look from the city. Aside from that, the architecture is so beautiful, that you get to admire all other places behind the facade. Entrance for foreigners is a bit higher, but as a local I truly enjoyed it.",
          "it was an interesting church but it is not a must to do in la Paz, pretty similar to the many churches in Peru with mixed artworks",
          "It opens only at 4pm, it\u2019s rather dark inside, and signs on the wall inside indicate that photography is forbidden. The church itself is a fairly impressive structure when viewed from the street, but inside it\u2019s rather plain, as far as catholic cathedrals are concerned. The",
          "The church itself is a lot like a lot of other Andean Cathedrals but it was originally the church of the Indio with the church for the Spanish across the river (now underneath the street called the Prado). There are guided tours that give you some access to parts of the church",
          "We were able to gain entrance to the church although as previously mentioned no photo's. Worth a walk around to see the luxuries inside the church, however if you are lucky enough to have a guide they will be able to explain the history of the church as well as the structure",
          "This place is easy to locate and perhaps the most lively place in the evenings. The church is pretty decent for a visit, no photographs are allowed. The lane next to the church has lot of shops where you can buy souvenirs.",
          "A catholic church with a lot of pomp in gold inside. Outsite many beggar, \"artists\" and tourists until late in the night.",
          "Some may say that La Paz is short on sights, but this is definitely one not to miss. You can only explore with a guide and photography is not allowed (as is the case with many museums in La Paz). The guide was knowledgeable and they have done a good job preserving relics,",
          "Its easy to find and visit in La Paz. My favourite building in La Paz, the rest of the city is a bit bland/run down.",
          "The San Francisco museum is one of my favorites in the city. It offers great insight into the history of La Paz and the country. It's definitely worth a visit.",
          "This 350 year old church is amazing in terms of both history and architecture! It also has a nice museum. Not so much the glass cases full of old things museum, but more of a walking tour which includes the bell tower with a great view of that area of La Paz. Basically,",
          "Old historic church with art museum, tour of bell tower and choir balcony, and plenty of daily street life out front. Several daily masses are held.",
          "Its cheap and the guides give very interesting information, with great paints and rooms. The guides seem really nice and friendly.",
          "Iglesia de San Francisco is an interesting cathedral, but doesn't really stand out from any others. Go to the museum next to it though and you will get a personalised tour around the former convent and can walk up on to the roof for some great views.",
          "The Church is nice, big and is a focal point in La Paz. The 20 bs museum tour is the way to go. Right next door to the main doors for the church. (closed on Sundays). The tour takes you around the inside grounds of the church. The 20 bs includes a guide that helps a lot.",
          "While the church itself is beautiful and worth spending a few moments in, the real gem here is the museum in what used to be the monastery. Completely fascinating glimpse of the history of both the church/monastery, as well as that of the surrounding city.",
          "I would not travel to La Paz to see this church, but if you made it already to La Paz, it's worthwhile visiting this site and its surroundings. Lots of history within (not properly \"packaged\" for tourists, which, in my opinion, is great). Very old construction (for LatAm",

          "This was a pretty church and convent. I think we unfortunately had a new guide who did not seem very well versed in the history which made the visit significantly less interesting. The distillery area was pretty neat. I listened in on another tour and wished we were part of that",
          "Built exactly over the Choqueyapu river where the \u201cSpanish\u201d city ended and the \u201cIndian\u201d city started, San Francisco church is the most important colonial religious building of La Paz. There are plenty of beautiful churches in Potos\u00ed and Sucre, but La Paz has only San Francisco",
          "We went to this museum expecting to see more pictures of Jesus and a church. The price of admission includes a private tour guide (meaning, we walked in and were immediately assigned an English-speaking tour guide), and this tour was excellent! We learned much about Bolivian",
          "Peaceful, interesting history, crypt closed the afternoon we were there but our tickets were good for a return visit.",
          "This is one of the communal hubs in La Paz. You can go to church, take in a puppet show, catch a bus, or try some street food. Just up the street is textile shopping, the witches market, and lots of restaurants.",
          "San Francisco has small cedar altars decorated with gold leaf designs. Candles are not used in churches here because of fire.",
          "Initially I wasn't planning on visiting the Cathedral, but then stumbled upon it as I was looking for the Witches Market. Once inside they provided a guide who spoke English. Usually, I prefer to self-tour, but I was pleasantly surprised by the information I learned about La Paz",
          "This church is centrally located and always teeming with people, especially on the weekends. Interesting colonial architecture.",
          "This place was well worth a visit but for me it was quite religious (I know it is a church but went into a lot of religious detail) It was wonderful that the guide was included in the entry fee and she was very helpful. Would recommend as it is beautiful and is a good way to",
          "One of the most beautiful and impressive colonial church in all South America. But be advised that it opens only after 3:30 pm!!!",
          "The most important historical building of La Paz is the San Francisco church, started in the mid-eighteenth century to replace an old church of the sixteenth century, as the first attempts to raise a temple dating back to 1549. The architect unknown certainly deserves to occupy",
          "I loved to see the church inside, never did it in my life and never imagined it would be so tranquil and peaceful to be inside the building itself. The terrace is awesome for a different perspective of crazy La Paz",

          "A beautiful church, and the best part is that a tour (in Spanish, maybe also in English) is included in the entry price. Our guide was very knowledgeable and seemed to enjoy showing us around and her explanations made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable than just aimlessly",
          "Did a tour. Our guide was very friendly and spoke great English. It was great to hear the history of the Monastery and Bolivia. Out on the roof top you can see the great bells and views of the city. A must see.",
          "Beautiful, among a circuit of really beautiful ornate churches in the area all in walking distance of each other.",
          "There wasn't really much inside. It has a pretty outside, so worth walking to, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go see it.",
          "There is a tour inside that you can do for less than 2 pounds. It's great cause it takes you to the secret areas of the Church. You will be happily surprise.",

          "This cathedral gives you a taste of what European cathedrals must have been like before war stripped them of their finery. Colorful and glittering, and filled with worshipers of every class.",

          "I just enjoyed the concert of a Bolivian youth orchestra in this very special colonial church, with pieces composed by both Bolivian and western composers. Therefore, in this complex you can see some exquisite religious artwork, and visit the museum to get a better understanding",
          "Its a beautiful temple and the museum its amazing, you can stand on roofs and see al the antiques. Its great!",
          "Huge and very old church at the bottom of Sagarnaga street. It is good to see it once or to escape the madness from outside.",
          "This is tipped as one of the most beautiful churches in Bolivia and it certainly lived up to that reputation. I was fortunate to enter the church at the beginning of mass and was able to join in the service and receive a blessing at the alter.",
          "Wonderful, old cathedral in the heart of La Paz, just down the hill from one of the great shopping streets for artisan works. I wish they had been a little more gracious about allowing photographs. Maybe charge a small fee?",
          "If you like churches, this is not to be missed. Great example of the inclusion of indigenous motifs within the Christian themes. The museum associated with the church is also very interesting.",

          "i love the church it is full of spirituality for i am a follower of st. francis of asissi, the only made me sad was when i attended the holy mass you can count on your finger the youth attending holy mass on saturday night and the church is not even full, only old people was",
          "One of the things to see in La Paz. Don't expect an English speaking tour guide. There are readers in both Spanish and English. It's a couple blocks away from Witches Market and makes a great addition to a walking afternoon.",
          "okay. Not spectacular. Many local folks there, and some tourists as well. Well located in the center, and close to calle sagarnaga, the touristic street for artesania....Gd place to stop by and pray for my trip....And thank God for the peace and rest afforded me by the church",

          "We paid our entry fee and were instantly met by a guide to show us around. She explained all the areas that we were allowed in to with great detail and I dont think we would have enjoyed the church half as much otherwise. She also had keys to the crypt/roof etc which I don't",
          "The church is large, lovely and mostly austere by SA standards (apart from behind the alter). The museo at 20 BS pp is relatively expensive compared to what else you can get for 20 BS - but the view from the bell tower is worth it. We were very lucky that the sun came out as we",

          "Great architecture. Going to the rooftop was great.",
          "The church looks lovely from the outside, with its bare stonework, but if you get a chance - go inside. It is only open for mass, so go at around 6pm and you will be able to see the stunning golden altars. It really is one of the most beautiful colonial churches I have seen",
          "I liked this church because of the distinctively South American way baroque decor was interpreted, with statues of holy figures clothed in elaborate garb, and that a service was still drawing worshippers.",
          "I was in awe at the church and its beautiful altars, paintings etc. Unfortunately there is no photography allowed, same goes for the Museum which is overpriced at 20B.",

        "wiki": "La Paz (Spanish: \"the peace\") is a waterfall in central Costa Rica. In Spanish, it is known as Catarata de La Paz. It is 31 kilometres (19 mi) north of Alajuela, between Vara Blanca and Cinchona.\nThe waterfall is located immediately alongside the road from Alajuela that leads to the northern plains of Costa Rica. The River La Paz forms the waterfall after traversing 8 kilometres (5 mi) of volcanic terrain, and then continues through the rainforest of the eastern side of Po\u00e1s Volcano. A short path leads behind the waterfall, where a small shrine had been located. Upstream from the waterfall is La Paz Waterfall Gardens, a hotel and park, where visitors can observe many different species of local wildlife.\nThe waterfall and surrounding area were severely damaged in the 6.1 magnitude earthquake of January 8, 2009. Landslides damaged the road that runs alongside the waterfall.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "What can I say about this amazing place. As soon as you walk in , your taken back by beautiful sounds of birds and lush greenery of plants. I went on a tour stop it was a little fast, but I got to see some amazing things. Sloths,toucans pumas and humming birds to say the",

It was built in 1835 with a neoclassical architecture with Baroque elements. It has an interior consisting of five naves  with different layers.\nThe first cathedral of La Paz was completed in 1692 after 70 years of construction; the first building was made of stone, lime and brick. In 1831 it was decided to demolish it due to the collapse of his presbytery and several cracks that threatened its collapse. The construction of the current cathedral began on March 24, 1835; it was inaugurated in 1925, marking the first centenary of the founding of the Republic of Bolivia. Although it opened that year, its interior ornamentation still continued until 1932.\nIn 1989, its two lateral towers were opened, this event coinciding with the visit of Pope John Paul II.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoman Catholicism in Bolivia\nCathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The church and plaza across the street create that small Mexican town atmosphere, and the exterior of the church is attractive. The interior is interesting in that the stations of the cross are all captioned in English. It is a rather plain interior, but you can spend a few",

          "We like churches, so visited this one. Scenic setting in the square and interesting melange of rock types to make it. Not much history available for the Spanish-challenged. Pretty plain but interesting inside. You are not here to see what churches in Spain or Italy look",

          "Learned how the amazing Coca plant grows, producing the wonderful pods containing the magical seeds from which all our chocolate evolves. Got to have many samples of the best. The higher the coca content the more bitter the taste.",
          "Small museum with an impressive amount of information on the different aspects of the coca plant. Had a rather quaint Bolivian Kiss in the bar on the upper level.",
          "I have seen that some people say it's too small, sure, but still interesting and you can have some drinks or food with coca, it's a good place to have some time and learn something about coca. CAVEAT: Not wheelchair accessible.",
          "A small but quite interesting museum, they explain a lot of details about the history and use of coca leaf in Andean culture. They also sell coca products such as liquors and chocolates!",
          "Thanks to the museum, we finally understand a bit more about this habit of chewing coca. They also explain how coca\u00efna is made from the leaves. Eventhough the place is small, they used every square meter to fill with information. Upstairs, there's a small cafe with drinks and",
          "This is a unique and engaging museum. That said, we found it to be reading-intensive, with not a lot to see in the actual exhibits. If you want to absorb it in English, be prepared to spend most of your time in a booklet.",
          "If you love to read and are able to absorb a lot of information within a short time, this is your place! The display is translated in various languages and you'll learn a lot about various aspects of the coca leaf, recommended!",
          "This museum was fascinating and we were very glad we went - we felt we learned so much about the Coca leaf. However it is a lot of reading so if that\u2019s not for you then I wouldn\u2019t recommend.",
          "Wanted to check this place out as it looked quite neat from the outside, stopped by a couple days ago around 3 and no one was there. No signs or anything though we checked later and it said they should have been open. Went there today around 12:30 and they were closed for lunch",
          "A distinctive museum. Pretty good idea unfortunately not well organized. The collection is mainly based on photos and posters, making it boring.",
          "A small museum but we spent 4 hours there as it is extremely informative. There is a booklet given with all the information that you need to know about coca. Me and my bf love it but we can also understand that this could be too heavy for those who want a museum tour that is not",
          "It took a few visits before the museum was open even though google was showing their opening hours as 10am-7pm. The first day (Friday, Feb 9) we tried it was just shut. The next day we turned up a bit past midday and were told they were shutting at 1pm so we either had to be",
          "One can learn all about the history of the coca leaf in a clearly presented, engaging way; there's also informative videos about local folk dances (a big part of Puno tradition). The friendly manager even spent time with us to try on various dance costumes and explain about",
          "We visited the museo on our first day in La Paz. The museo is small but informative. There are not many exhibits but plenty of huge boards with all you need to know about Coca. There is also a restaurant upstairs where you can get Coca beer and other drinks and goodies. It is",
          "Its definitly worth it, to visit that Museum when you interested in the history and all about the Coca plant. We also got an guide for the different stations in our language, that was perfect. The topic at all was well introduced.",
          "Fascinating museum, well laid out and lots of fascinating information about the historic usage and modern abuse of coca. I imagine it could get a bit crowded in peak season and you may find it a tad difficult to find - but it is well worth coming here.",
          "This place is made just to take advantage of curious travellers. Not much is there about the pre-hispanic history of coca consum, nothing about colony or anthropological and archaeological meaning of coca but a few boards. On the contrary you will find a lot of apologies of why",

          "There is not a lot to see, but a LOT to read, in fact, if you don't read the book that they gave you when you enter, you will not learn anything. But if you read, you can learn a lot of thing. You can buy coca candy, and you can bring it back home !!!",
          "I was at the coca museum in one of my first days in La Paz and it made me completely change my mind about the coca cultivation as we Europeans allocate mostly negative associations to that plant and it\u00b4s further processing to a devastating drug. I learned the rich history around",
          "The museum has some really cool information, but it is wall to wall words. If you don't understand Spanish, they will literally give you a book to read. Again, good information, but all easily found online by googling history of coca. If you're tight on time, I wouldn't",

          "My husband and I stopped here, mostly because we thought it'd be kind of funny to stop by a museum about coca in Bolivia. It ended up being very insightful, and we enjoyed the stop! It was smaller and less-formal than we thought it would be, but it was fascinating to learn about",
          "Went to the museum today to check out the history of the coca leave. It's 15bs entry and they give you a book with the content translated to English (not sure what other languages they gave though). It took us about 45 minutes to read through the book that guides you around the",

          "Great museum about the history and background of Coca. They have brochures in many different languages, so Spanish is not necessarily required.",
          "I agree with the agenda clearly pushed by this museum, on the other hand I prefer my museums to be a little less in-your-face about their agenda. Yes the confusion between coca and cocaine is obviously silly and, yes, the war on drugs is attacking a plant with a long history of",
          "The information this museum provides really helps you understand the value the coca leaf has on this culture. They give a great history about its role in Bolivia. It also touches on the negative stigma it gets because of the drug trade. I recommend it for the information it",
          "The place is small but the owner was helpful. I was given English information to understand the exhibits. Just an ok museum for me.",
          "Ok so as some other reviewers and lonely planet state it is a bit \"tired\" but you do get a pretty decent history of the coca leaf and cocaine and some other pretty interesting info. Some of the info should definitely be updated but my wife and I really enjoyed it.",
          "The museum is ok - the information it provides isn't much new. The court yard in front is beautiful. Did not try the cafe - but a lot of different coca based drinks.",
          "The museum did provide an assortment of information but the display and set up is poorly done. I guess my favorite part was then little cafe upstairs. There you can try different drinks made from the coca leaf. The prices are pretty reasonable for it being \"touristy\". The guy",
          "There is no English description inside the museum, but you will be given a book to read about the translations, so we turned out sitting just besides the reception reading the book most of he time, and then take 5 minutes to go inside the museum to have a quick look of the",
          "It may not be much to look at, but if you're curious about the history, use, and culture surrounding the coca leaf - this is a wonderful museum to visit. Who knew there was so much to learn about the tiny coca leaf. Its significance is fascinating, and I think it's definitely",
          "If you are in the area stop by and check it out and find some interesting facts about coca. Few minutes walk from witch market",
          "This small and simple, but relatively well presented museum is located in the Witches Market cobblestones streets. Less than $2US entry. You are given a folder with full translations in English as you guide yourself around thr numbered displays. Learn about history of Coca from",
          "This museum looks like someone's project on cocaine and the coca leaf. Although some of the information is interesting and there are a few good physical displays and photos, there is far too much reading which distracts from the experience. The sequence of panels is not always",
          "Yes, you can find good information about coca, though some of it seems to be a bit old. Actually, I would not call it a museum, since it is mainly some tiny rooms with information specially for reading. Ten people there and it is a crowd. Nice restroom!",
          "Neat to see if you are interested in coca and it's history, but the one in Cusco (free Sundays) I found to be better put together. Worth a visit if you can't go in a different city.",
          "Meh... it's fine if you have nothing else to do. The information was interesting and for the price it's okay. If you are walking around and have 20 or 30 minutes to spare then go for it.",
          "My husband and I visited here because we had time to spare... it doesn't take long to get through the museum, it's rather small but super interesting. I learnt sooo much stuff here - you just have to be willing to read through the exercise book they give you to take around (but",
          "The coca story itself is very interesting, but the museum is terrible. They numbered the pannels according to the parts os the story is belongs, but the sequence is very confusing to follow and after part 15 (it's about 20) they stop numbering. The graphic design is also",
          "We went here as had a few hours to spare. It only cost 13 bolivianos to get in so we thought we may as well give it a go. It was actually very informative and we learnt quite a bit. It could do with updating maybe but all the information is there.",
          "This small museum is a good little place to pass an hour or two if you want to learn a little bit about the history of cocoa and the role it has played in South American / Bolivian life. You get given a booklet in your chosen language and then walk around the various displays",
          "The cafe upstairs is nice, if you on the other hand want to know about the coca leaf or cocaine, try wikipedia, cheaper and better.",
          "It is a very small museum. Displays are informative, educative and provocative. It is worth a visit if you have an hour to spare.",
          "This small museum gave lots of info about the history of coca in Bolivia, its relationship with Coca Cola and present-day uses.",
          "Learn about the many uses of this sacred leaf! The guys who run the museum are helpful and enthusiastic. We tried a shot of the coca elixir and it set us right for exploding La Paz!",
          "A great trip through the history and current use of coca and the coca sweets that are available there to purchase are great, nothing like the green lollies you see in all the tourist shops and tienda's. An hour and 13 bolivian well spent.",
          "Not much to say, but it was interesting to know many facts about coca, from the local traditions to drug abuse and pharmaceutical use.",
          "small but very funny to visit. No photo. A good explanation of the \" system\". Coca is usually used. But \"concentrate\" is prohibited. The museum show the difficult way to do and the warm-full of the process. Coca is la like tea and chewing gum, no more for Bolivian. Cocaine",
          "I was a bit disappointed by the quantity of information in this museum. There was some interesting history and information about coca and its many uses. It felt very cramped when we went and was tough to really stand and read because of people trying to make their way through. I",
          "The Coca museum is a small place at the end of a short alley. There is decent sinage and is not very hard to find. admission is about $2.00 us or 13 bs. Depending on your language you are given a guide book that explains the exhibits which are numbered. The layout could be a",

          "The facts are somewhat interesting, albeit somewhat repetitive and out of date. Guaranteed you will learn something new about coca. The presentation is what makes it a bit of a boring thing to do (you are essentially given a 17 page essay about coca which may or may not",
          "I've been going in and out to this museum-caf\u00e9 for the last three-four years and i haven't seen much of an update. However, the information provided is very essential and it's all in one place. The location is perfect, the building itself is worth a treat with lots of stone",
          "You'd think that a museum devoted to a subject like this would find some way to make their presentation engaging and attractive, instead it's two small rooms and a back hallway papered with photographs and charts and such detailing the history of coca production and use for",
          "Enjoyable 40 mins and not expensive. Lots of reading and displays cramped but informative. Must visit in la paz but just don't expect to much really as its a cheap time filler",
          "Hard to guess what the take is, because they list some of the horrors of drug addiction, while at the same time advocating for the legal consumption of coca leaf, which IS legal already. Still, a pleasant enough place to kill an hour or two any given afternoon.",
          "Good exhibits and a wealth of knowledge about a completely mis understood plant. Remember, coca leaves are to cocaine like poppy seeds are to opium!",
          "What an informative little place!! Super tiny, but packed with information and pictures, definitely see this place! You will learn so many things you never thought could be true!! Only downsides - you can't take pictures inside and you need to know that the caf\u00e9 is not open",
          "The history of coca was nteresting. Takes about 45mins. All information provided in English. Nice coca candies",
          "The word \"Museum\" is a slight overstatement. Two rooms of somewhat entertaining anti-American/pro-coca farming propoganda might be a bit closer. Apparently America's drug problem is due to weak will and the production by the US of chemicals that are used in the production of",
          "We had heard good things about this so dropped in. You get a guide book in English so you can follow the exhibits around with translations. Everything you ever needed to know about coca and a bit more! Including the Bolivian perspecitve on the coca cola company. It was set up to",
          "This museum needs some major updating. A lot of the information is at least 20 years old and as I was walking through I was wondering what has happened since the articles were written. A lot of the information is also pretty biased and anti-Western. I have been living in",
          "this museum is more like an amateur display of a collector-enthusiast, there is a lot of info but it lacks updating. it is small and cramped, i had to wait to see some of the displays it is extremely cheap, almost free entrance but the quality inside reflects the price on the",
          "For 11 Bolivianos it's hard to go wrong, but even if it were a bit more expensive, I'd still recommend going since coca plays such an important role in Bolivian culture. The museum itself is mostly text and pictures, but there's a cafe where you can try various products made",
          "Yeah, as others have said you probably could find all the info on the internet- but it would take you alot longer to compile the range of info they have, and you can't have a cocoa beer afterwards. Staff are really helpful and knowledgeable- well worth having a chat with them,",
          "We took the kids (don't, it is a lot of reading and nothing hands on but at least they were free). It is a small place and is mainly pics and descriptions in Spanish but you get a book in English that translates everything. 45 mins is adequate at most to wander round. OK if",
          "We expected something better. In fact it's a small place with mainly pictures attached to the walls and some sheets of paper explaining what the pictures present. If you don't speak Spanish, you need to read the same stuff from the book they give you at the reception. It can be",
          "The museum is cleverly packed into quite a small space, and feels very much like the look and feel is based on a hippy cafe in Amsterdam. There are very few \"exhibits\", and most of the content is pictures and explanations on notice boards which you read in sequence around the",
          "the museum is VERY small and basically it's a series of panel-mounted photos, articles and explanations (with an accompanying booklet in English) that covers a lot aspects of coca production, history, culture, as well that of cocaine. Very intersting and informative. well worth",
          "The Museum was very informative but not very interactive. The exhibitions were in Spanish but you get an English translated booklet when you enter. It is a lot of reading if you want to get all the information but it covers the history of the leaf, the traditional uses, the",
          "The Museo was tiny and expensive. 15bs. We spent the whole time reading the book they gave us which removes the idea of a museo and means you may aswell read up at home. Not only was the museo tiny it was noisy as there was cafe right above. Some interesting facts",
          "An extremely interesting museum on the history of Coca. The museum is tiny and there is a lot of reading invloved but very informative nonetheless.",
          "An interesting history and review of the coca leaf and it's place in Bolivian life. The cocaine bit is interesting especially as of the 36 nations allowed to legally produce cocaine by the United Nations Bolivia & Peru who grow the leaves are not included.",
          "Awesome informational TREASURE. This museum is for intelligent people who are interested in knowing everything there is to know about the Coca leaf.Not people looking for idle entertainment, like the ones who wrote the poor review. They totally embarrassed themselves with a",
          "In my opinion a museum is supposed to be interactive. It consists of one room with a few irrelevant photos and we were given a booklet to read... Absolute waste of money! All the references are from the 80's and are therefore way outdated. My boyfriend and I felt more like it",
          "As an English speaking person I received the script with translation of everything in museum. I liked the idea of the museum, but I think that it is a little bit outdated. It reminds all these 'pieces of art' that kid could hang on the wall with the introduction of 'soccer",
          "At first I couldn't really find out what I expected of the Coca museum, but when I came in, felt the atmosphere and went through, I was amazed. Eventough it's a small museum it's really good and rich on information on the use of Coca in the Andes countries, and in the Western",
          "This museum was in a run down building and they basically give you a readers manual on the history of coca leaves and you walk around the building with your manual and match the manual text/sections up with the pictures and history displayed on the walls. It was cheap to get in",
          "The information provided was in a book that you read and followed through a series of pictures. Best part was being shown how to properly chew coca leaves.",
          "It is really interesting to learn the history of coca and what it means to Bolivians. You will not believe some of the things you will learn.",
          "Coca is a great part of bolivian culture. They have been chewing it for thousands of years, and I thought this museum would teach me a great deal on it's importance and implications. It did, but it has some facts wrong, for example, the relationship between coca cola, cocaine",
          "Is a good museum. Could do with more interactive exhibits like trying the coca leaves.",
          "This place is worth visiting, but the exhibits are a little bit staid. The real attraction for me was the cafe upstairs. We had coca tea and coca cookies and we had a really nice time recovering from altitude problems there.",
          "It is self guided from little paperback books they give you. OKAY, but not mind blowing. It is educational, however, and I learned a good bit.",
          "The information is excellent... and I recommend a coca cake from upstairs.",
          "This place has a great little cafe, that you should definitely visit after you spend some time learning about coca. I would definitely place this high on the list of things to see in La Paz.",
          "I enjoyed visiting this little museum while walking around downtown. They give you a little guide to read in your home language at each of the displays as you walk through. It was interesting and upstairs they had a little cafe where you can taste coca tea and coca snacks.",
          "The museum does what it is supposed to do; teach you about Coca. All posters throughout the museum are in Spanish but translations in many languages (including English, Dutch..) are available. Because you get a small book full of all information I just sat down and read through",
          "We came to this museum and were very surprised over the high quality. We drank quite a lot of chocolate that day. We saw the whole procces of how to make chocolate.",
          "For 10bs this us a bargain. It doesn't take long and is very informative. They give you a book in English to read as you go so it's a little like walking round a room reading a book, but worth it. Gives good insight to south American take on chewing coca leaves, and where this",
          "We visited the Museo de Coca after visiting the Witches Market earlier in day and this side trip filled an hour fairly easily. There was some interesting displays, and they provided translations free of charge. The writing was a little extensive at times, and the visual displays"

Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country.

Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times.

Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o.

Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

          "I was told that if you only have time for one museum in La Paz, choose this one. I was not disappointed. Nominal entry fee \u2013 just great value, even if the explanations are in Spanish. An interesting thing happened when I tried to take a photograph and was told in rapid Spanish",

          "I must have spent at least 90 minutes here. At the time of my visit they had a special exhibit on masks of Bolivia which I found very interesting. Also the exhibit showing feather work was totally fascinating. Expect most signage in spanish only.",

          "Another museum located in central La Paz, this one should be high on everyone's list. The museum features the unique culture and traditions of Bolivia in addition to its wildlife. There is a huge gallery on Bolivian textiles including a big collection of beanies which we found",
          "We visited the museum when we had some time left in La Paz. You pay 20 Bolivianos as entrance fee, and if you would like to take pictures, you have to pay 20 Bs more. It was fun and interesting to look at all the textiles and masks, but every information was (only) in Spanish.",

          "This is a small yet very interesting collection of traditional crafts. Highly recommend a visit. It's conveniently open until 7pm.",
          "The best curated and most modern museum we have been to in South America. It would be great to have even a brochure in English but it doesn't really matter, we still enjoyed the videos and displays. 20Bs for foreigners to enter. Recommended!",
          "The museum has an excellent collection of textiles, masks, metal and earthenware used by the indigenous groups in South America from the Inca period till now. We were also given a guided tour (in Spanish) in the afternoon by one of the curators.",
          "We were enticed into this museum by its pretty courtyard, and rendering that the book had said it had some grotesque, yet beautiful exhibits. It wasn't wrong. Everything in the museum is beautifully laid out and displayed. It's done in a way that makes everything you see",

          "The museum costs 20 Bs (3 USD) for foreigners and is located in a old buildings with beautifully carved railings in the patio area. It's well worth a visit. The exhibits are varied: pottery, textile/weaving, ceremionial masks, silver/gold creations and also included some",
          "The museum was one of the highlights of my time in la Paz. The entry was $3US, and, the same amount if you wish to take pictures. There were special exhibits on weavings and hats which is one of the top reasons I visited Bolivia. Most of the signage was in Spanish but the",
          "Don't hesitate to go to the museum of ethnography & folklore, it's absolutely brilliant. In my 3 months between Chile, Per\u00fa & Bolivia it's in my top 3 muesuems! From my perspective it's current top 3 are: 1/ temporary exhibition space showing social ephemera from 70's, 80's,",
          "I've been to a lot of museums during my months in Latinamerica - but this one has a few unique features. The first exhibit goes into a lot of depth about textiles - the process is laid out from llama to finished product, with many beautiful examples. There is also a fantastic",

          "Before you go anywhere else in the country, this museum will give you an excellent overview of Bolivian culture and history. Before you go textile shopping in Sag\u00e1rnaga street, you need to see their textile and lluchu (hats) collection to appreciate the artisan work behind it.",
          "Museum tells the history of the Andean clothing and cultural aspects. The temporary shows are also incredible. There is a Cafe downstairs also. A must go!",
          "Great display of ceremonial masks - very well done. The ceramics, textiles, metal-work and feathered costumes were also great. Sure, there is little interpretive signage in English, but what the heck, I just made it up!",
          "We went to MUSEF with my sister and brother-in-law. We took a very informative tour, which introduced us to Tiawanaku, a civilization that predated the Inca. Quite the surprise to us naive Americans. It led us to Tiawanaku, which is an archaeological site well worth a visit",
          "A wonderful museum; a must visit. I recommend to start here before even visiting the rest of the country. It will create a great awareness to the fabulous cultures, colors, archeology that will be found along the way. This museum is very well organized into several thematic",
          "Good organized and well equipped museum for 20Bs. Recommended to bring a 2 hour time and advanced Spanish language level or book an English speaking guide. There are temporary expositions that are included in the price.",
          "Favorite parts for me was textiles & ceramics. Lots of examples of each. Plus, the videos are well worth a watch. Very educational to see the processes broken down, step by step. Wish I was that talented...",
          "Pursuing my long-term interest in ethnic textiles, culture and lifestyle, we spent two hours (although you could do it more quickly) in this very well curated small museum in the old centre of La Paz. There was an excellent room with examples of spinning and weaving equipment",
          "I went to this on the night of museums with a friend who I am interning with here (both ~20 yr old females), so it was relatively crowded, and we felt a little rushed. It was very good information about the history and culture of Bolivia. They have a little bit of everything.",
          "We visited this museum in April 2016. There was a play going on in the courtyard! (it was in Spanish, but you could get the idea that it was about corrupt priests and aristocracy). The building is itself very interesting (It seems to have been a home at one time). The",
          "I was amazed by the weaving collections and the Mask collection is amazing New Orleans Move over the gift shop has nice selection of quality well priced local craft",
          "We really enjoyed the permanent exhibits. From the textiles to the hats to the videos that helped elucidate the exhibits we had a fun time. We especially enjoyed the hats/headware exhibit. Well worth stopping in while in La Paz.",
          "Don't miss the feather art exhibit at this lovely museum. We also liked the exhibit of retablos and the ceramics.",
          "This museum is in a converted mansion and contains three exhibits: textiles, masks and feather decoration. No photos are allowed inside the museum unless you pay an additional 20 Bolivianos (well worth it as you see such interesting & unusual things!). We had a local guide",
          "Let me be clear, museums are not a must in Bolivia, if you compare with the museums in Lima, or the Golden museum in Bogota or the Antropological in Mexico city, there is no comparison. Museums in La Paz are very basic and small. If you have 2 or more days in La Paz, take a walk",
          "Real goof representation of the local weavings and also of the folkloric cap's, costumes and their evolution as Morenada, Diablada and more. To get a good look you need at least one hour to visite",
          "From the woven textiles to the masks to the feather headdress amazing collection. The layout leads you from area to area. Yes there is mostly spanish labels but you are in a spanish speaking country that only in the last 10 years has been moving to a modern city. As more",
          "The entrance fee is 20b and a little more should you wish to take pictures. The museum is well designed and has great content, weave history, lots of really great woven hats through the years and an amazing display of masks. I spent around 1hr30min pottering. The information",
          "What a terrific museum, beautiful exhibits, we especially loved the masks and the gigantic feathered hats of the famous dancers. Nice little cafe at the exit too.",
          "This was a wonderful museeum-well curated and modern. The exhibit of masks from all over the country with explanations of their usage (dances, festivals, cultural context) was amazing. You could easily spend a couple of hours just in that section. The colonial street the museeum",
          "Because it was hard to find elsewhere, here are the museum hours: Monday-Friday: 9.00 am - 12.00 pm; 3.00 pm - 7.00 pm Saturday: 9.00 am - 4.30 pm Sunday: 9.00 am - 12.30 pm The museum is different from most I have encountered in other South American countries because its",
          "Not a word in any foreign language. And tourists are those that have to pay. The exhibits are impressive, but for the lack of signs you are bound miss them.",
          "Well done, a small but lovely, clean and complete museum. A surprise find as it is a bit far away. Worth going...",
          "The exhibits in this museum should not be missed. While the museum is not often promoted, I would encourage you to go.",
          "This is a well curated museum, with lots of historical fabrics, pots, money and other objects to see. The highlight for us (and many others it seems) was the mask room, which not only presented a bunch of old masks, but did so in a very atmospheric room. Well worth the visit",
          "This is a pretty impressive museum, well presented, alot to see and the masks in the floor are worth a look. However I knock off two stars, one for Spanish only labels and another for the tiresome discriminatory of charging foreigners more 4 times in this case.",
          "I really liked this museum. I don't remember if they have much English descriptions but it's a really nice way to get to know a bit more about Bolivia. The visit really tweaked my interest in visit Tiwanaku. A pace\u00f1o friend of mine say its the best museum in town.",
          "Fantastic traditional woven textiles, well displayed with good information about the origins and history of the weavings, some going back several centuries.",
          "This is located in a very nice preserved colonial building. They have permanent and temporary expositions. All of them well organized and presenting detailed explanations about the traditions attached to each objet.",
          "Worth a look to see the incredible masks, a small but nice gift shop...guide needed to appreciate. Our travel company selected this museum.",
          "A treat for anyone interested in Bolivian material culture. (And how could you not be?) Textiles, masks, ceramics, munecas, lovely shop, in a beautiful colonial building. Great cafe too!",
          "What I liked most was the display of masks from Bolivian dances, although few of them were very old. On the other hand, the pottery and carvings go back to the earliest known settlements. This is a very traditional, scholarly museum. Some of the descriptions were hard to read",
          "This is a very sleek and modern building on the outside, which is unexpected for the area. My favorite section was the textiles, as I love fabrics of any sort. Seeing how these textiles were made increases the respect you have for this form of artwork. The ceramics are also",
          "I went to MUSEF expecting to find a classic bolivian museum with everything old including the spaces you walk, but I was gladly impressed with a very modern space with a reaaly nice collection of Masks, Textiles, and numismatics. Looks like they have put a lot of effort in",
          "Superb collection of masks, textiles and other items. This fairly large place offers airy exhibition rooms and a modern way of throwing light on its great collections.",
          "This museum is near the central plaza and not to be missed. Having English titles would have made it excellent. There was a very unique feather exhibition, halls on ceramics (spoiled by not having dates!) and linens, a display of masks and finally a well-done chronological trip",
          "Nice building, very interesting exhibitions about Andean ceramics, textiles and masks. It is also a nice place to visit for those interested in Pre-Columbian cultures.",
          "I really don't like to write about museums but this one had such a great masks (you cant take the photos) in a dark room, so it is one of those museum that I remember and that I can recommend.",
          "This museum gives a thorough overview of the cultures of Bolivia. It offers a good initial orientation for the visitor about to embark on a tour of the country or for someone just returning from such a tour and in need of a visual summary.",
          "Impressive collection of ancient fabrics really brings to life the vibrant and creative capabilities of the Andean weavers. Also has great section on pre-Incan civlizaiton at Tiwanaku. For $20 bolivian it's worth it.",
          "On a sunny, quiet Sunday morning, this is a wonderful way to immerse yourself in a part of Bolivian history you might not have thought of experiencing. I was interested in the history of traditional weaving and the museum did not disappoint. I asked if they sell the video that",
          "The museum has a great collection of carnival masks, tribal head wear made out of feathers, pottery,weaving and a section on the history of the Bolivian currency. The cost of entry was 20 Bolivianos.",
          "Although it is also holiday season for the Bolivians, all the musea aee closed to our surprised. The whole street, calle Jaen was closed till jan 6th.",
          "We only stopped at this museum to get an overview of the traditional dress. The historic pictures of the women were worth the visit",
          "A fine if old-stylke collection of Bolivian folk art, mostly textiles. Photos ar enot allowed, unless a specialticekt is bought. On my visit (on a Sunday), this rule was enforced in a funny way: the lady at the ticket counter sent her little (i mean <10y) daughter with a",
          "Easy to understand displays of masks, textiles, feather costumes. Beautifullty displayed. This museum does not take a long time.......but is worth every minute. Quality items in the shop. Very close to main square and the shopping districts. Please don't miss this museum on",
          "Visit it before to meet people of Bolivia. You can after understand the traditional hat of women, the Christan influence on local way of dressing.. very important !. The Spanish \"influence \" on this great civilization is terrible. All part of way of live. after the visit",
          "a comprehensive guide to the different cultures of la paz, well displayed, not many people, the mask room was fantastic as was the head-dress room. The cafe next door is a good place for lunch and the gift shop was first class",
          "If it is raining in la paz, or if you just have some time left, it is a good idea to visit this museum. It is not a must, but it has some interesting things, especially the weavings and the masks.",
          "They have a great textile exhibit, and good short term expositions. I is truly amazing what intricate weavings people of the past could do.",
          "I was most impressed by the textile portion of this museum. My wife and I spent about 3 hours in this museum. We are not big textile people but we really enjoyed reading about the different designs and spent a long time looking at the drawers of different textiles in the first",
          "This a very nice museum with a small collection of interesting textiles, pottery, feather arts, and masks. If you like these sorts of things, then you will enjoy this museum. Like most visitors, the mask exhibit was my favourite part. I did think that the price of 20 Bs was a",
          "This is a must see museum. We showed up 30 minutes before closing and therefore had to visit each room quickly, but I will definitely go back next time in La Paz. Their is an artfully lit Mask hall with an amazing selection of traditional masks from all Bolivian cultures. The",
          "Excellent collection of various subjects related to the folklore and history of the local population, particularly the indigenous cultures. There are both permanent and temporary exhibits, so there's always something to fascinate.",
          "On Sundays the museum closes at 12:30 which I didn't know when I bought my ticket at 12:10. (20 bob). The ticket agent asked if I wanted to buy the 2nd ticket so I could take photos. I told her I would look first and come back and get the ticket if I thought I wanted photos.",
          "Especially if you're into the handicrafts of Bolivia. Several great exhibits of textiles, masks, ceramics and their use of feathers in hats. They have great videos showing how the different peoples used these things. It's not worth paying the extra 20B. Other people said it was",
          "The Museum, located in the center of La Paz, has great exhibitions, especially when you're interested in Anthropology. There are some things to be aware of: - it looks small but has actually 3 floors with fabrics, masks, feathers, potteries, history of Bolivia til today and",
          "I enjoyed this museum. Unfortunately, I don't read Spanish very well, and there is no English translations. However, the museum is still a very fun place to go. They have ancient textiles and ceramics, but I definitely enjoyed the extremely cool room of masks the best (although",
          "We visited the museum as it had been highly recommended. We weren't really sure if folklore was our thing but thoroughly enjoyed the viist. Entrance was 20BOB each and 10BOB to use a camera - which is well worth it, particularly for the display of masks which are really great",
          "If you have only one museum to do in La Paz, this is the \"one\". 25 soles for the entry ticket plus 25 soles for the camera. It is worth paying for the camera especially for the mask collection that you can take in picture!!",
          "A impressive museum in an impressive building near the city center. The masks collection is a must see!",
          "This is one of the best museums in the world, in my view, and certainly one of the best on the (South) American continent. It starts with a very interesting exposition on Bolivian textiles, but then continues with a brilliant display of carnival masks. With the light play, it is",
          "This museum's entrance is in a beautiful colonial building. You look around several different themed sections, for example pottery, currency, masks and costumes. One of the things I really liked weas the way it is laid out so you can see things easily. I also liked the way they",
          "While we had planned to see this museum anyway, when we actually went we mostly did it as a way to escape the rain for an hour. Or so we thought, because we ended up staying much longer than that. Not only is the building itself beautiful (at least the old part), but there's a",
          "The collections of ceramics and masks are great. Te mask exhibit really shows how the Bolivian culture celebrates festivities over the years and still does. Three floors of exhibits so expect to spend a couple of hours here.",
          "This is the best organized museum in La Paz, in a beautiful private house. it is well maintained and well labelled.",
          "Make sure you get here early so that you have enough time to see EVERYTHING bc there is literally a ton to see! If you want to learn more about the Bolivian culture this is the place to go! It's just a great day trip plan!",
          "I loved this museum: found it by accident and decided to take a look. The entry is in a lovely old colonial building but further in it goes into a modern building. It is well laid out. There are lots of different masks etc from many of the various communities, pottery, textiles,",
          "Worth going to for the room full of fantastic masks alone. Great videos on ceramics and other handicrafts. Almost everything is in Spanish.",
          "A really well presented museum which gives and insite into the cultures in Bolivia. Should not be missed",
          "A little hard to find but worth the search. So much to see on 4 or more levels. Very helpful security guard who pointed out 2 areas that we nearly missed.",
          "Nice way to spend an hour or 2 but I preferred the art museum",
          "if you like culture, textile...this is the place. Go.",
          "I liked the museum. It is not huge, so it takes about an hour to see around. It has good collection of masks and differnet hats and mask mafe of colourful feathers. The collection of ceramic is pretty modest. tehre is also snmall collection of textile. Nice courtyard with",
          "FAscinating displays of masks, weaving and pottery, from pre=Columbian to contemporary. Very well curated",

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country.

Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times.

The highway runs 11,7 km and crosses the city of El Alto:\n\n Autopista La Paz-El Alto/RN-3 (La Paz-El Alto Highway) - Connects La Paz with El Alto.\n Autov\u00eda La Paz Oruro/A-1 (La Paz-Oruro Highway)  - Connects La Paz with the cities of Oruro, Patacamaya and Caracollo. It then connects with Ruta Nacional 1/RN-1 (National Highway 1) heading south to the cities of Potos\u00ed, Camargo, Tarija.The Southern District, one of La Paz's most affluent and commercial neighborhoods, is relatively separated from the rest of the city, including the CBD. The Avenida Costanera and Avenida Kantutani (Costanera and Kantutani Avenues) connect the southern district with the rest of the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nEl Alto International Airport (IATA code: LPB) is La Paz's national and international airport and a principal hub for L\u00ednea A\u00e9rea Amaszonas and Transporte A\u00e9reo Militar. It also serves as a focus city for Boliviana de Aviaci\u00f3n, Bolivia's flag-carrier and largest airline. The airport is located in the city of El Alto and is (13 km) south-west of La Paz's city center. At an elevation of 4,061 metres (13,323 feet), it is the highest international airport and fifth highest commercial airport in the world. The runway has a length of 4,000 metres (2.5 mi). It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport.\nInternational carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca, LATAM Airlines and Peruvian Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, Santiago and Cusco. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft.\nAirport facilities include ATMs, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, car rentals, duty-free shops, and free Wi-Fi internet. Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines.\nThere are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

        "wiki": "La Recoleta Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio de la Recoleta) is a cemetery located in the Recoleta neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. It contains the graves of notable people, including Eva Per\u00f3n, presidents of Argentina, Nobel Prize winners, the founder of the Argentine Navy, and a granddaughter of Napoleon. In 2011, the BBC hailed it as one of the world's best cemeteries, and in 2013, CNN listed it among the 10 most beautiful cemeteries in the world.\n\n\n== History ==\nFranciscan Recollect monks (los recoletos) arrived in this area, then the outskirts of Buenos Aires, in the early eighteenth century. The cemetery is built around the Recollect Convent (Convento de la Recoleta) and a church, Our Lady of Pilar (Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar), built in 1732.  \nThe order was disbanded in 1822, and the garden of the convent was converted into the first public cemetery in Buenos Aires. Inaugurated on 17 November of the same year under the name of Cementerio del Norte (Northern Cemetery), those responsible for its creation were the then-Governor Martin Rodr\u00edguez, who would be eventually buried in the cemetery, and government minister Bernardino Rivadavia.The 1822 layout was done by French civil engineer Pr\u00f3spero Catelin, who also designed the current facade of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral. The cemetery was last remodeled in 1881, while Torcuato de Alvear was mayor of the city, by the Italian architect Juan Antonio Buschiazzo.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSet in 5.5 hectares (14 acres), the site contains 4691 vaults, all above ground, of which 94 have been declared National Historical Monuments by the Argentine government and are protected by the state. The entrance to the cemetery is through neo-classical gates with tall Doric columns. The cemetery contains many elaborate marble mausoleums, decorated with statues, in a wide variety of architectural styles such as Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Baroque, and Neo-Gothic, and most materials used between 1880 and 1930 in the construction of tombs were imported from Paris and Milan. The entire cemetery is laid out in sections like city blocks, with wide tree-lined main walkways branching into sidewalks filled with mausoleums. These mausoleums are still being used by rich families in Argentina that have their own vault and keep their deceased there. \nWhile many of the mausoleums are in fine shape and well-maintained, others have fallen into disrepair. Several can be found with broken glass and littered with rubbish. Among many memorials are works by notable Argentine sculptors, Lola Mora and Luis Perlotti for instance. The tomb of Liliana Crociati de Szaszak, due to its unusual design, is of special interest.\n\n\n== Notable interments ==\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Walking around the various stacks of burial spots in walls, on the ground, row after row was interesting but repetitive. Many graves had everything from holy objects and statues to also toys, dishes and of course flowers. The site was massive but we didn't realize just how large",

        "wiki": "Valle de la Luna (Moon Valley) is situated about 10 kilometers from downtown La Paz, in the Pedro Domingo Murillo Province, La Paz Department, Bolivia.  It consists of an area where erosion has worn away the majority of a mountain, composed primarily of clay rather than rock, leaving tall spires.  It is similar to another zone of La Paz that is known as El Valle de las Animas (The Valley of the Souls). It is an important site of the famous holiday, Dias de los Muertos (Day of the Dead).Because the mineral content of the mountains varies greatly between individual mountains, the sides of the mountains are different colors, creating striking optical illusions. A majority of them are a clear beige or light brown color, but some are almost red, with sections of dark violet.\n\n\n== See also ==\nValle de la Luna, Potos\u00ed, Bolivia (El Sillar)",

        "wiki": "Laguna Niguel () is a  city in Orange County, California in the United States. The name Laguna Niguel is derived from the words \"Laguna\" (Spanish for \"lagoon\") and \"Niguili\" (the name of a Native American village once located near Aliso Creek). As of the 2010 census, the population was 62,979. Laguna Niguel is located in the San Joaquin Hills in the southeastern corner of Orange County, close to the Pacific Ocean, and borders the cities of Aliso Viejo, Dana Point, Laguna Beach, Laguna Hills, Mission Viejo, and San Juan Capistrano.\nLaguna Niguel has its origins in the Rancho Niguel Mexican land grant, which was acquired in 1959 by the Laguna Niguel Corporation to develop one of California's first master-planned communities. As a predominantly residential city, Laguna Niguel serves as a bedroom community for the job centers of northern and central Orange County. Laguna Niguel has a median household income 31 percent above the Orange County average and nearly double the U.S. average. It is known for its mild coastal climate, low crime rate, and its numerous parks and public trails.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early inhabitants and settlers ===\nThe first recorded inhabitants of the Laguna Niguel area were the Acjachemem Native Americans, who may have had a village called \"Niguili\" near the confluence of Aliso Creek and Sulphur Creek. Aliso Creek marked the boundary between the Acjachemem and Tongva people. In the 1700s, during the Spanish colonization of the Americas, Spanish missionaries established the nearby Mission San Juan Capistrano to convert the Acjachemem (called the Jua\u00f1eno by the Spanish) to Christianity. The Mission lands, which included the present-day boundaries of Laguna Niguel, were divided into private land grants in 1821 upon Mexico's independence from Spain.\nIn 1842, the 13,316-acre (5,389 ha) Rancho Niguel was granted to Juan Avila; he retained ownership of the land through the Mexican\u2013American War (when California became part of the United States) until 1865, when a severe drought forced him into bankruptcy. In 1895 Lewis Moulton and Jean Pierre Daguerre bought the Rancho Niguel and other portions of the surrounding area from farmers who were struggling due to persistent drought conditions. The Moulton Company was established to oversee 19,000 acres (7,700 ha) of local land which was used, mainly for orchards and sheep ranching, well into the mid-20th century. In 1951 the land was divided between the Moulton and Daguerre families, the latter inheriting 8,056 acres (3,260 ha) in the future location of Laguna Niguel. In 1954 the Daguerres sold 7,200 acres (2,900 ha) to the Shumaker Group and 856 acres (346 ha) of oceanfront to George Capron, a former Major League Baseball player who established the Capron Ranch.\n\n\n=== Laguna Niguel Corporation ===\n\nThe completion of Interstate 5 in 1959 enabled easy access to job centers in Los Angeles County, creating a boom in the Orange County housing market. In 1959, Cabot, Cabot & Forbes and Paine Webber partnered to form the Laguna Niguel Corporation, which purchased the Daguerre land to develop one of California's first master planned communities. The initial 7,100-acre (2,900 ha) town plan was created by Viennese architect Victor Gruen and expanded beginning in 1971 by AVCO Community Developers after they acquired the Laguna Niguel Corporation. The name of the city was created from \"Laguna\", a reference to the tidal lagoon that once formed at the mouth of Aliso Creek, and the name of the Acjachemem village Niguili that once occupied the area. As the city would be developed in stages, ranchers and farmers signed annual leases with the Laguna Niguel Corporation to use the land until the planned communities were built.\nIn contrast to a traditional bedroom community, Laguna Niguel was designed so that \"families should have most of their economic needs and their social and cultural interests met by facilities within the community\". The plan was also notable for its emphasis on parks and open space \u2013 comprising nearly a third of the land to be developed. The Laguna Niguel Corporation went public in April 1959 and raised an initial $8.2 million from investors. In 1962 the first tracts of Monarch Bay and Niguel Terrace were completed, consisting of 565 homes. In 1960, the Moulton Niguel Water District (which today serves all of Laguna Niguel) was established by a conglomerate of ranchers, to import water from the Colorado River Aqueduct as the area lacked a sufficient natural water supply. In 1964, Crown Valley Parkway was completed from I-5 to the Pacific Coast Highway, facilitating transport through the growing city. By 1965 the population of Laguna Niguel reached 1,000.\n\nThe Laguna Niguel Homeowner's Association was formed in 1966 as an advisory to the Orange County Board of Supervisors (which governed the as-yet unincorporated city). In 1973 Laguna Niguel Regional Park opened to the public. The Chet Holifield Federal Building (a local landmark popularly known as the \"Ziggurat\"), designed by William L. Pereira, was constructed for Rockwell International and was meant to bring 7,000 jobs to the area. After the end of the Vietnam War, Rockwell reportedly lost a defense contract with the federal government and the building was left unoccupied. It was eventually traded to the US General Services Administration in exchange for industrial facilities elsewhere.The Ziggurat, which was completed in 1971 well before the development of residential communities in the area, is one of Laguna Niguel's most noticeable landmarks. The Orange County Register described it as \"the only constant in an ever developing locale.\" It houses millions of microfilms as documents of land agreements between the American government and Native American tribes of the southwest United States. It is also home to the Western Regional Department of Homeland Security and the California Service Center of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. The building was featured in an ending scene for the 1975 sci-fi movie Death Race 2000 and as the headquarters for the Luckup Corporation in the 1983 movie Deal of the Century. It was also used for the 1995 movie Outbreak, where it served as the exterior for the Centers for Disease Control headquarters.\n\n\n=== Incorporation and conflict with Dana Point ===\nIn 1965 the Laguna Niguel Corporation had purchased George Capron's oceanfront property and began to develop the Niguel Shores neighborhood, known in its early days as the \"Coastal Strip\" and today as Monarch Beach. By the 1970s the as-yet unincorporated Dana Point began expressing interest in annexing the Niguel Shores area; in 1977 Dana Point briefly proposed incorporation with Laguna Niguel as a single city. Both cities submitted incorporation requests in December 1986, when a controversy immediately erupted over the coastal Monarch Beach community. Although Monarch Beach had been developed by the Laguna Niguel Corporation, its residents voted 61 percent in favor of joining with Dana Point. Laguna Niguel filed a lawsuit, which was ultimately turned down by a judge. Laguna Niguel was formally incorporated on December 1, 1989, without the coastal strip, as Orange County's 29th city.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\n\nThe population increased quickly during the last few decades of the 20th century, from 12,237 in 1980 to 61,891 in 2000. Growth since 2000 has been slower, with an estimate of 65,806 in 2015, due to the fact that the city has been fully built out. In 1992, Alicia Parkway was completed to I-5, providing a shorter route for northbound commuters; in 1996 the 73 San Joaquin Hills toll road opened, linking Laguna Niguel to the Interstate 405 in Costa Mesa. The Laguna Niguel City Hall, which had been planned as early as 1989, finally opened on October 15, 2011.In 1994 local residents first noticed damage to retaining walls and roads near an artificial slope in the Niguel Summit community, and geologists warned that the area could be subject to a landslide. After heavy rains caused by the 1997\u201398 Super El Ni\u00f1o, the hill collapsed on March 19, 1998, destroying four homes at the top and five condominium units at the bottom. Fortuitously, there were no deaths as the area had been evacuated only a few hours prior to the collapse. An investigation revealed that the company responsible for development, J.M. Peters Inc., had improperly packed and graded the 275,000 tons of fill supporting the Niguel Summit homes. In addition, the project had been plagued by instability throughout its construction, and halted repeatedly \"after complaints of mudslides, slope washouts, erosion and dust.\" The Los Angeles Times reported that \"according to county records, the developers were warned that building on \"ancient landslides\" could be unsafe, but they were able to continue construction after producing their own geological report that persuaded county officials to let the project go forward.\"\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLaguna Niguel is located at 33\u00b031\u203255\u2033N 117\u00b042\u20329\u2033W (33.531938, \u2212117.702503). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 14.9 square miles (39 km2). 14.8 square miles (38 km2) of it is land and 0.05 square miles (0.13 km2) of it (0.35%) is water.\nLaguna Niguel consists of mostly hilly terrain, being located within the San Joaquin Hills. The average elevation is 400 feet (120 m); elevations range from near sea level to 936 feet (285 m) at the summit of Niguel Hill, in the southwest corner of the city. Neighboring cities are  Aliso Viejo and Laguna Hills to the north, Mission Viejo and San Juan Capistrano to the east, and Laguna Beach and Dana Point to the south. On the west, it borders the significant unincorporated acreage of Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park.The main watercourses in Laguna Niguel are Salt Creek, which flows through the southern part of the city, and Sulphur Creek, which drains much of the northern half. Sulphur Creek is a tributary of Aliso Creek, which flows through the wide and deep Aliso Canyon before reaching the Pacific Ocean. Laguna Niguel Lake, formed by damming Sulphur Creek, is the largest body of water in the city. Although Laguna Niguel is located very close to the Pacific, it does not border it, the result of a controversy over the coastline with Dana Point in 1989 (see #History).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike much of coastal Southern California, Laguna Niguel has pleasant weather year-round. On average, August is the hottest month and December the coolest. The highest recorded temperature was 108 \u00b0F (42 \u00b0C), which occurred in 1963, and the lowest temperature was 21 \u00b0F (\u22126 \u00b0C), which was recorded in 1949. Precipitation is sparse in Laguna Niguel, as only five months out of the year receive rainfall greater than one inch, with an annual average of 14.2 inches (360 mm). The highest monthly rainfall on average occurs in February and is 3.4 inches (86 mm).\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nLaguna Niguel is home to many upscale neighborhoods including Bear Brand Ranch, El Niguel Heights and Golf Course, Ocean Ranch, Laguna Crest, Laguna Woods, Laguna Sur.

Over one-third of Laguna Niguel is public open space, a legacy of the original 1959 Gruen plan, and is divided between 31 city parks and 4 county parks. Laguna Niguel's major roads are designated as \"scenic highways\" within landscape corridors, which includes parks, decorative medians, and grade-separated recreational paths. The 227-acre (92 ha) Laguna Niguel Regional Park is centrally located and includes an extensive trail network, ball courts and Laguna Niguel Lake, a popular fishing and boating venue. Crown Valley Park, visited by about 240,000 people per year, has the city's main public sports facilities. Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park, which borders Laguna Niguel on the west, consists of over 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) of canyons, grasslands and riparian forests along Aliso Creek. Aliso and Wood Canyons is part of the larger South Coast Wilderness, 22,000 acres (8,900 ha) of preserved open space in the San Joaquin Hills that also includes the larger Laguna Coast Wilderness Park and Crystal Cove State Park outside the city limits. The interconnected city and regional park systems provide a significant refuge for wildlife in an area of Orange County otherwise filled with suburban sprawl.There are about 80 miles (130 km) of non-motorized trails in Laguna Niguel for hiking, biking and horseback riding. Major hiking trails include the Aliso Summit trail, which hugs the rim of Aliso Canyon on the western edge of Laguna Niguel, and the Colinas Bluff Trail on the eastern border, overlooking San Juan Capistrano.

The Aliso Creek and Oso Creek trails are mostly outside Laguna Niguel, but link the city via greenbelts to other parts of south Orange County. The Aliso Creek Trail is also known as the \"Forest to the Sea Trail\", as it is planned to connect the Santa Ana Mountains in the Cleveland National Forest to the Pacific Ocean at Laguna Beach.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nErik Apple, mixed martial arts fighter\nGavyn Bailey, singer-songwriter\nPatricia Bates, California State Senate\nMcKayla Maroney, 2012 London Olympics medalist\nCady McClain, actress, singer and author\nTimmy Moreno, former bassist of metalcore band SeeYouSpaceCowboy \nFrank Rosenthal, professional gambler, former casino boss, and reputed Chicago Outfit associate whose life was partially depicted in Martin Scorsese's 1995 film Casino\nMimi Walters, U.S. House of Representatives\nRachel Wood, soccer player\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n Al Qaim, Iraq\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country.

Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times.

Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

          "I'm not a big church-goer; more of an art and history buff. But I did enjoy my visit to this chuch and the grounds within. My volunteer(?) guide really helped the appreciation of the building and its history. We explored a few hidden nooks and crannies and even went up on the",
          "The entry fee of 20 BOB is worth it. We had an informative guide take us through the museum, explaining the history of the Cathedral, paintings & St Francis along the way. The cloisters , garden & rooms we visited were very interesting & we got to go up onto the roof of the",
          "A much visit attraction in La Paz. Such a beautiful church. The gilded alter is everything you would expect from a church this old. But please remember when you visit that it is a living and breathing church. Lots of Bolivians use it every day to pray. to see their display",
          "Beautiful architectural monument. As you enter the building you will feel its grandeur and its unique peace that is so missed by many modern churches today.",
          "A little difficult to walk round as I was there when there was a service on. Pars of the Cathedral are highly decorative and rather baroque in style. I always feel that these are too grand for the needs of religion. The glory of the church not a place for worship. Lovely facade",
          "Discovered I could not only explore this beautiful Cathedral, but I could actually climb to the bell tower at the top. Not for the fainthearted. The stone staircase is narrow and winding. You can only explore being escorted by a guide provided once inside. Also you must leave",
          "Cool looking church, busy plaza in front, and a great mercado building right next to it where there are multiple stories of all kinds of stalls",
          "This church, later called a small basilica was first built in 1581, damaged by 1612 and rebuilt by 1753 to be the impressive edifice that it is today. The founder of the church, Francisco de los Angeles Morales has his remains entombed here. The fa\u00e7ade has intricate carvings of",

          "The exterior really is the main show here ... It\u2019s pretty bland (for a Catholic Church!) inside but worth sticking your nose in. Some of the side alters are clearly very popular with locals ... adorned in flowers and people queuing to pray.",
          "This church and the history are amazing (and I'm not usually a huge church person when traveling). the tour was very cheap, and you get to know the history of the church and some of La Paz, and get to go on the roof for amazing views. I highly recommend taking the tour!",
          "A beautiful old church with an always busy square artists, vendors, comedians, travelers, locals... everyone. Interesting place to relax with some fresh popcorn or coconut water while you take in the sites, sounds and smells of La Paz.",

          "Even if you are not inside the structure and the history about it, is something that you can not forget from inside is so quiet and the smell of old church is unreal, the people preying and getting some spiritual connection is something that it's not so common to find. Special",

          "This will be a quick review. This place is only good for pictures. They have Some spots that make for good pictures. The cost is and very much about 20 Bolivianos or about 3 US dollars. I\u2019ve taken the tour three times because I had some visitors that wanted to see it. The guides",

          "Went here as part of an organised full day tour with Transturin. Beautiful Spanish style church in the middle of a very busy part of town. Lots of beautiful paintings inside. Worth a visit if in La Paz",
          "It was a good place for some history about Bolivia and the construction of the most beautiful Church that I visited in Bolivia. The best part it's to feel the cold air around the back. The sad part is that we couldn't took some pictures of this beautiful place.",
          "There is no charge just walk in. The church is extremely ornate with golden altars and paintings and statuary everywhere. It is a basilica and is, I believe, the oldest church in La Paz dating back to the middle of the 16th centuries. Founded by the Franciscan order. Next",
          "The entrance fee is 15bs with a private guided tour (mandatory). The guide we had didn\u2019t speak good enough English for us to understand the places and keep rushing us to the next spot. The museum and the church has quite a few different rooms and art gallery with brief",
          "Really nice place. We paid 15bs and the guide was included. We got a lot of informations and felt comfortable with our authentic and nice guide.",
          "This old church is a solid addition to the spirit of La Paz. While the outside is not especially compelling, the inside is highly ornate with many intricate golden carvings around pictures of holy persons. There was a mass in progress while I was there and I was impressed by the",
          "Very nice inside architecture, also nice facade with a mix of indigenos and conqueror symbols. A bit tricky to visit on a Sunday as there are a lot of services. Even, worth to sit in, have a quite moment and look around the paintings, the gold foil decorated ornaments.",
          "It's worth it to come in and see the church while it's open. Very pretty and huge. It's only open during Mass, so entering and sitting quietly recommend",
          "Before going in the church we took a tour of the adjoining monastery. This was most interesting and very informative. We were shown models of the monastery both before and after alterations that cut the size of one of the quadrangle. You have to go on a tour to access the",
          "This iconic church is a place of refuge from a crowded square in front of it. The wall-to-wall main altar is a riot of gold with an assortment of uniquely Bolivian santos. The church also boasts La Paz's best rooftop view which is only accessible if you buy a ticket to the",
          "The architecture of this church is very interesting in that it combined religious Catholic statues alongside indigenous symbols. For a small charge you can walk up to the top of the bell tower for a great view of the city.",
          "This was the starting point of our walking tour. The outside is more impressive than the interior. 10 mins inside was more than enough time to look round.",
          "Nice and interesting for a short visit. Not so different from many other churches nd cathedrals in South America. Visit if within walking distance or a short cab ride, but not worth a long trip just to visit this place.",
          "Interesting church to have a look at. It is useful to get a guide to help you understand and appreciate some of the intricacies and stories behind the building, as well as how the religious developed. Follow my #30somethinggapyear on Instagram @DatLoongJourney.",
          "When you visit a foreign city, particularly like somewhere in Central or South America, there are a certain number of buildings to see - palaces, government buildings, cathedrals, etc. This is one of those in La Paz. St Francis seems to be a popular saint in this neck of the",
          "Although you don't get to stand in the actual sanctuary, you do see a lot of the church and the surrounding buildings. Don't miss a visit to the bell tower and roof, if you don't mind narrow passageways.",
          "The truth is difficult to contemplate in its entirety. The structure is made of stone and its history is worth remembering. If you are wearing a hat",
          "Entry ticket included a guide, however you might get a uni student whose English is not very fluent. Interesting history of the cathedral and Franciscan monks. Worth climbing up the steep narrow staircase to the bell towers that offers nice view of surrounding and interesting",
          "My husband and I visited the museum attached to the church as our first stop in La Paz. I can't remember the cost, but I know it was low. The rooms in the convent contained paintings and historical information (all in Spanish). There was no one to offer a tour in English,",
          "well worth a stroll through to see the beautiful main and side altars. Was reverent and respectful as Mass was being celebrated. Obviously not as opulent as the churches and cathedrals in Europe.",
          "We've taken an English tour of the church. The lady is an extremely experienced one who can manage to show us all important features of the church in a 40 minutes tour. However, the tour is a bit too short and we think it should take 1.5 hour to finish reading all those",
          "The museum offers many rooms with detailed explanations of the history of the building & the Spanish influence in La Paz.",
          "An artistic and architectural jewel. Incredible structure in the city. Good memories in adjacent stores.",
          "Is one of the the principal churches in lapaz and a really enjoyed the place the museum is great! With guides, nice place to go for small history.",
          "Originally founded in 1548 as the Convent of San Francisco followed by the church in 1549. Rebuilt in the mid 1750s the current baroque mestizo style church still stands and is a minor basilica. For a reasonable entrance fee, I received an individualized and comprehensive tour",
          "The Church is beautiful, but when we went on a tour (20 b) we didn\u2019t learn anything due to a stressed guide. But if you\u2019re happy with just the interior- go!",
          "Very interesting temple, outside amazing figure ( people , dragons animals , plants) old door , baroque style. Inside simply with many altars on the right and left sides. Photo - prohibited .",
          "When we purchased tickets the staff said there would be English guide available, but when we walked up the stairs to start the tour, the staff there said there won't be any English guide. We walked by ourselves for a while until we bumped into a group of German tourists being",
          "Sadly no photos but this building is very different to the cathedral which is mord in European style. The altar is gold replica. A huge full wall. There are statues and paintings in the native style and as our guide indicated represents a polytheistic belief system totally",
          "This is well worth a visit, it has a lovely peaceful atmosphere and is a beautiful building. Shame about the hideous tower blocks all around it.",
          "We visited Iglesias de San Francisco and were in absolute awe. Very well preserved and full of historic items thoughtful displayed. It was like a walk back through time. We would highly recommend visiting this Historic Site in La Paz. Well worth the time and money spent. Easy to",
          "When I arrived at the church, early afternoon, I was told it was not open to the public until 6:00 PM. However, the church museum was open and admission is cheap. I was accompanied by an English speaking guide (although her command of English was rather rudimentary). I climbed",
          "Very old rustic church, absolutely breathtaking on the inside well worth a visit. The day we visited it was decorated with hundreds of flowers!",
          "I\u2019m not catholic, but I can appreciate all the fantastic structures they have built and this one is impressive. Be warned, you are not supposed to take pictures inside . . . Oops! I didn\u2019t see the sign until we were on our way out.",
          "We passed by on the Saturday but it was closed only the museum was open, we did pass by again on Sunday and we were able to catch a mass which was very touching The church itself was very pretty.",
          "Watch for pickpockets, but it is an interesting structure to visit. Lots of people congregate in the general area.",
          "The outside is a reminder of Spanish colonialism and the architecture exquisite. It's not opulent like what I saw in Italy but it's massive and simple in structure. Inside it's a very much a daily practicing church where local devotees spend much time. Very very cool. It's",
          "The church is not as impressive as its counterpart in Lima, but the tours provide great insights and take you up the bell tower. The guide we had spoke french, and was very knowledgeable. It is even amazing to see that there are still monks living there",
          "We went for the Sunday mass, goes on every hour 7:00 to 11:00 AM. Unfortunately the guides only works Monday to Saturday, we will like to know more about the history. Even with aren't in too a mass worth the visit to see the Spanish conquers power.",
          "It's a toss up as to whether the cathedral of the San Francisco church is the more stunning highlight of La Paz. The SF church is more accessible in terms of opening times, but photography is completely forbidden inside. The architecture isn't as impressive as the cathedral, but",
          "Visting the church after 1600 is free and one can take a leisurely look around the stunning interior bearing in mind that photographs are strictly prohibited. The craftsmanship and dedication that has created the carvings and facade are staggeringly good. To view the monastery",
          "This is arguably the most famous Plaza in La Paz. It's nice, but not impressive when compared to many of the famous plazas of the world. I certainly would not go out of my way to visit this place. But if you're in La Paz and have some free time, it's probably worth stopping",
          "Once you enter to the Musuem you start to like it, the guide was very nice and helpfull!!! The paintings are beautiful!!!",
          "The tour is good, and they have tour guides that do it in English. A tour of about 30 minutes. A little expensive bit worth it if you don't mind being bossed around for that length of time.",
          "If you're staying near the church of San Francisco this is a good place to plan your day after breakfast while people watching.",
          "I usually don't go to churches but I was there with my father and, beside he goes to church, we needed a place to rest! Lol We got there at the end of the Sunday worship and it was nice. They had a choir and people were singing and actively participating. I was raised as",
          "Went in to church on a Sunday as it was the only day it was open while I was in town, managed to attend mass which was interesting in itself",
          "The church is beautiful and worth a visit. The city square there is very popular. The mime clown is fun, as well as the Michael Jackson impersonator. Lots of actives and vendors. Great area.",
          "You can't miss this church; it is the epicenter of the city. Lots of people and activity. Church is unique example of baroque mestizo style.",
          "Nice old church that seemed to be the center of local activity. There are lots of vendors in the area",
          "Unusual church blending the county's cultural traditions both inside and out but especially on the fa\u00e7ade. If not to everyone's taste, full of interest and well worth a brief visit.",
          "We enjoyed an English speaking guided tour through this incredibly historical building and got a nice view of the main square. The tour takes you through tight stairways and if you're lucky, to the script. Fantastic way to spend an hour.",
          "Good way to spend about hour our guide juan alegandro made the tour very interesting and was free as part of the entry fee worth a visit",
          "The Church can be visited by simply entering it, when it is open, but the adjacent museum enables the visitor to see its Franciscan Convent as well as the Bell Tower and various other nooks of the complex. The Mestizo Baroque architecture is of special interest",
          "We really enjoyed this tour of the cathedral. The church is very old and since it was built clergy have lived here (still do). There and a few rooms where you really sense how it might have been to live here 300 years ago - and how oppressive the colonial morality was. We had",
          "The building is a real gem. My only complaint is that you can only wander around as part of a guided tour, and our guide pushed us through at a brisk pace. I would have liked to take more time. I presume the tour is due to the meandering nature of the building. Parts are closed",
          "The church is beautiful inside and out, it was very touching to be there during a mass and hear the voices raised in song filling the space, I'd go back to lion around more as I didn't like to during worship. The museum however is a disappointment - it costs 20bol to get in, a",
          "The english guide on the museum.. Oh dear lord! Well, he didn't speak good English, I didn't mind that but he was so scared and embarrassed about that so he practically ran the place through and on the way just pointed up the objects and said a few words about them. The",
          "The museum and the church are definitely worth a visit. The church is not accesible at all times of the day but if it's open it's worth a visit to see the beautiful altar and have a look at the crypts.",
          "Located at the crossing of Sagarnaga and Murillo streets, in the back of the plaza with the same name, Iglesia de San Francisco is perhaps the oldest in the country. Construction started in 1548, before the founding of the city of La Paz, it then collapsed in 1612 and built",
          "Well worth the visit. It's a beautiful church measuring up to those in Europe. The detailing on both the interior and exterior is incredible",
          "Make your way here and then head off up the many laneways and explore the old City . The Church has lots of activity outside as well as the usual views inside",
          "The architrcture is a combination of european and indiginous...so it is a beautiful unique church...no doubt But whats more excited are activities at the front...such as chess tables and street concert",
          "One of the Most Important buildings in La Paz and a unique architecture and facade-decoration! Note the floral motives and the inca-faces there! And never forget to say a prayer for the Peoples of Bolivia!",
          "This is a historic church built upon the peace between the rich spaniards and mestizos and the poor indigens The church is nice and classical; however it has been partially restored and in the process some of the charm went away to be replaced by glitterness",
          "This is a really lovely church in the middle of crazy and busy La Paz - worth a visit even if you're not catholic or religious.",
          "The monastery is interesting to visit and there is a nice view from the roof and bell towers. The guided tour provided only basic information and was only in Spanish though they do have alternate tours in English. The information delivered was pretty basic though, and provided",
          "Nice church on a busy square where everyone tries to sell anything. Very close to the touristic Sganaga street.",
          "Me and my friend are Australian and we visited this church today and not only did Daniel fill us with knowledge we had a good laugh together highly recommend for a fantastic experience! Muchas gracias Daniel & San Francisco!! Two proper legends",
          "Beautiful building and a lovely town square adjacent. Exterior architecture is stunning, the solemn dark interior is incredibly interesting. Worth a 30 minute stop.",
          "Cool place to visit, I must for all those visiting La Paz. Here you will see the San Francisco Church, loved the architecture of this church with Mestizo and Baroque influences.",
          "A busy square where everyone collects. Watch your valuables. Church is old and great to take photos of.",
          "You won't believe there is a place hidden in the middle of such trafic noise. San Francisco Church and Museum is worth to visit. There are guided tours and is cheap. You can visit the church and museum just in 30 minutes and climb until the bell tower to enjoy a beautifull",
          "La Paz' oldest church and convent, if I'm not mistaken. Beautiful mestizo decorations on the front and the altar. Also have a look at the museum and the rooftop walk is not to be missed.",
          "Don't miss this attraction. Take your time in the church. The inside of the church might be frightening to young children. My son did find the decorations scary but this is a must see in La Paz.",
          "What a fantastic example of baroque in America. The altares and pulpits are beautiful! You should not miss this place!",
          "It is a gorgeous Church, the architecture and design is very intriguing and appeals to all. The only thing is that on week days they open at 4;00PM, but other than than, well worth it",
          "The best way to see the church is taking the museum tour. The church is more than just a church it's a convent. In old times it used to be a larger convent to which lay people where not allowed.. Now you can see parts of it. The climb to the roof is worth it! Enjoy",
          "For 20Bs you get a guided tour in either English or Spanish, this lasts approx 45 mins so good for teenagers with a short attention span! You get to see around the monastery and the highlight (literally) would be the view from the church rooftop overlooking the city. The access",
          "Besides the church, the huge space in front is a central gathering for many events in the city. In fact, the entire time we stayed here, every night there was a band playing and the plaza is so crowded. Back to the church, it is located in the Sagarnaga area. The",
          "Tours are available every day of the week besides Sunday for 20 Bs. This grants you entrance and also a tour guide. I went alone, and they didn't even make me wait. I got a personal tour. They offer English and Spanish (maybe others but those were the only ones they offered me).",
          "Great spot to be at. The markets start from here, the mall is across the street and the street vendors...we'll some of the best in La Paz.",
          "Located west of El Prado. Founded in 1548. The facade is decorated with stone carvings of chirimoyas, pinecones and tropical birds. It is just a lovely church and when you go inside you can feel at peace and get the feel of how many Bolivians are devoted Catholics.",
          "The church was certainly built on a grand scale and while the Italian marble flooring is opulent the rest is not as ornate as other churches such as in Cusco etc. It's free to get in so worth a quick look if you're passing.",
          "Our guide spoke good English and took great interest in his job. The church is quite amazing. No photos allowed inside but that only cemented the experience for me.",
          "There was a lot of history behind this church, and it is beautifully maintained. Our tour guide was young, but knowledgeable, and we enjoyed our time here. We went on a weekday during the day and ended up being there the same time as some local schools were doing tours, but our",
          "This is a must! We visited the church with an English guide, a very knowledgeable social science student who guaranteed that we got all historical information. The site with the first column of the church in 1549 was impressive, also the visit to the roof top with bells!",
          "Loved the tour, I was guided by a charming young lady that explained everything and I was very impressed. Very nice little tour.",
          "The buildings are amazing, but it was the guide who made it special. A young woman named Helen who spoke excellent English explained the allegorical meanings of the paintings to me in a way that unlocked them for me -- I should add I've been to dozens of galleries all over the",
          "We enjoyed the life and vivacity on the plaza outside of the church. The guide gave us an interesting accounting of the church's start and the early days of Catholocism in Bolivia",
          "This church was founded in 1543 and has a lot of history. There two kinds of tours. The museum tour that takes you up to the bell tower and the church tour. I took the museum tour and was able to take some breath taking pics. Watch you step because the floor and steps are",
          "We didn't have a plan on what to do after returning from Tiwanaku, so we decided to pop in and see the church. It was a beautiful place to visit! The tour guides (free of charge) were great and very knowledgeable, the architecture is beautiful and history of the place is great.",
          "This is one of the most beautiful churches I have ever visited in Bolivia. It is a real historical treasure with a breathtaking architectural baroque style! The interior of the building looks expansive and the \"retablos\" are immensely rich and ornamented; not to mention the",
          "We didn't go inside because it didn't look open. All the locals were sitting in front of the doors. It's a marvellous building to look at from outside anyway. The plaza is a great place to people watch. There is also a huge souvenir market behind and a huge food market in the",
          "Wonderful Colonial Church in La Paz with a crypt beneath the basilica, have a museum in the colonial convent",
          "The church was OK and the convent beside it, nicer. The guide who showed it was not really friendly, She just pointed out four times that 'if by accident you make one of the bells ring you should pay a big fine of 1000 BOV'.",
          "A very building housing an imposing Cathedral of a neo classical style and not the common Baroc style found by most Catholic churches. The building with beautiful Greek style columns is plane but respectfull surrounded by wonderful stained glass made in Italy. The Cathedral was",
          "the church is located in the central plaza. The inside is beautiful with large ceilings and beautiful stained glass",
          "Right in down-town stands this church, the visit includes a tour to the SF monatesry/museum and the temple. My favorite part is to go up to the roof and see the city from there.",
          "Very interesting church in the center of La Paz. I found that La Paz does not have that many exciting places to visit so this one is a must. Like most churches in southern America this one is richly decorated and the main altar is spectacular and do are the side altars.",
          "This is a great place to visit and soak up the history. It's very crowded outside and can be loaded full of tourists. Be careful with your belongings. Read up on the history of this amazing church and the area as well is full of rich history - far away and recent history as",
          "Glamorous, rich, splendid ... There are not too many places in La Paz that deserve a visit, this one definitely does. Decorated in the typical ostentatious manner this is a fantastic place to visit. The main altar is spectacular, much like the ones seen in churches in Peru.",
          "I had been in La paz three times before i finally visited this magnificent gem in the heart of the city. the tour was cheap and well coordinated with excellent hosts that even spoke English. Very impressive service for such a cheap tour. The building and all the paintings are",
          "This was an important church in the history of Bolivia and a visit is a very worthwhile experience. The cost is a paltry. 20 Bolivianos and includes a guided tour. We wandered about reading the English postings but joined a tour which took us to some places we could not access",
          "The church in the middle of the city is Iglesia de San Francisco. Although the building itself is quite old and very impressive, I found the surrounding area to be much more interesting. Up the side street of the church is where you will find all the street vendors selling",
          "Gloria was our tour guide. Great!! Tour was in Spanish, but I understand there is an English option. Very interesting tour with great works of art, then a visit to the top of the church for a birds eye view and a behind the scenes look at the running of the church. So much",
          "Right from the intricate facade and into the church itself...one cannot but go back to the time when this was built, Spanish conquistadores laying what they must have seen a magnificent relic of christianity on South American soil, very rich in design and lavish in gold.",
          "So much colour, a Bolivian flavour of the Catholic faith with strong Spanish roots. A mass started about 10 minutes after we arrived so we did curtail our visit somewhat, but we did enjoy the colourful interior & the facade even more.",
          "The church is a great example of mestizo-baroque. Building and artworks from indigenous people and Spanish colonisers. The adjoining museum is well worth the visit. You can climb to have a great view of the elaborate roofs and tiles and to watch Pace\u00f1os from above on their day",
          "This was a beautiful place to visit and the museum was very interesting as well as the outside of this structure. Very crowded though so beware of your belongings.",
          "You need to get the tour - they will take you places, like the belfry and the painting collection - you can't otherwise see.",
          "This church has an amazing stone carved facade depicting natural themes. The interior has extravagantly carved altar pieces with abundant gold leaf. The cloisters house the museum which is well worth a visit as you get to see the choir, the dome roof and view the the interior",
          "This is one of the old church here. The architecture is good.Quite crowed all the time.Worth the visit.",
          "Many people hang out outside this church, people sitting on the footsteps of the church, either talking or eating or just resting. Quite an interesting site for me. I guess even the outside of the church bring some kind of comfort and rest. The inside of the church is amazing. I",
          "Nice place to know the culture of la Paz and shout America but you have to watch out. It is no a safe place for tourist, take care you cameras, wallet and back pack",
          "Very impressive Spanish style church that is a historic location in the city of La Paz. Sorry no pictures inside, but comeback at night for the free public shows and entertainment outside the church.",
          "The museum basically consists of two rooms, one that explains the story of settlement and the other shows the old brewing equipment. The savior for our 20bs each was access to the roof of the church. Looking down into the church from the upper level was good and then using some",
          "Really interesting Franciscan monastery and church-they have tours in English and Spanish. A lot of history, art and architecture to enjoy.",
          "very nice and relaxing place to unwind and relax. Not a lot to do, would not make a special trip here again.",
          "A historic church at the upper end of El Prado (main street in La Paz), in Plaza San Francisco, first built in 16th century, rebuilt in 18th century. You can go in church for free, and visit the museum for 20 Bolivianos (about \u00a32), where they take you on a tour of the cloisters",
          "We took the tour for 20 bol each, and it includes a guide. The guide was the worst we ever had in our lives. He could not answer any of our questions... Basically you have to follow him, and listen to his explanations, which he learned, but don't be curious you will never get",
          "You can visit the church itself without paying for a tour, and it is quite beautiful on its own. The architecture is very unique with many indigenous touches. However I would recommend that you pay for a tour at the museum next door. It cost us only 20 bolivianos and we were",
          "With nothing to do in the city at the time I paid the entrance fee and didn't expect much. The church is so so beautiful and there's so many rooms to explore. Gorgeous courtyard outside with a garden and fountain. Once you get onto the top roof you have an amazing view of the",
          "Beautiful church, and the included your was great too, really added to the experience, giving you a good history, not just of the church, but of the city too. Must see while in La Paz.",
          "I'd say it's just another church. I was there when the pope visited and the area was quite animated. I prefered the plaza in front of the church to the church itself. This area of La Paz is quite touristical, but It's nice.",
          "It's quite a beautiful church! I was lucky enough to be there during \"Semana Santa\". So there was plenty of activities outside the church. This also meant learning about the history regarding the church without taking the tour. I didn't take the tour this time I visited but I",
          "San Francisco church is located at the end of Sagnagara, a main tourist shopping street. And is beautiful inside. Much more ornate than the main cathedral a few blocks away. Take time to come in to see the sanctuaries and main alter.",
          "I typically get saddened by visiting churches of the conquering society, but in this case, this cathedral was fascinating to me. Pay attention to the foundation of the church, and the small ways that the Bolivian artisans worked in their own aesthetic and expression into the",
          "Nice, but I didn't think it was that special or that it stood out from other churches. Still, the area around it is extremely lively - there are tour agencies, a market, accommodation, etc. that make it a good place to visit.",
          "It is a very good place/ historic site to visit. It is right at the historic central part of La Paz. We love visiting historic sites and this one was very good and we really enjoyed visiting the whole of La Paz city",
          "We have visited a lot if chr he's and whilst it does get a little repetitive, this one is pretty good. We got the free tour with our entry (but slipped a small tip to our guide) and we felt this was a nice way to learn about some if the history, and also be taken up the bell",
          "Bas\u00edlica de San Francisco and its adjoining museum are a gift to the traveler. One can climb to the belfry and enjoy a brilliant view of downtown La Paz. Mass service is also a very rewarding experience for catholic people.",
          "Overall the church is nice and is located in a nice plaza, but it isn't spectacular. HOWEVER, the tour made it much more interesting. I thought it was a bit on the pricier side (bolivia standards) for a tour but it is guided (english or spanish) and lasts about 45 minutes. It is",
          "Building is impressive, typical is churches in South America. Is visited by tourists and locals . At the entrance there is always something going on.",
          "Great stop for a bit of history and chance to walk in the catacombs and see bones of monks in the past.",
          "It is a nice old church in a cute area. The square is always full of people and the neighborhood around it is nice to explore.",
          "Beautiful old church in a great part of the city. In all honestly we weren't the right people to appreciate a historic church, but it is impressive and worth a stop.",
          "That's a beautiful church right in the middle of La Paz! Close to the most famous streets. It is beautiful also inside. During the day, the square in the front is always crowded.",
          "amazing colonial old church in the center of la paz.our hotel was located very close to this church so we have had the chance to see it at different times of the day. quaint spot",
          "This is an very impressing place to see, with art and artifacts all over its almost required to visit this place more than once. I had a great time for hours walking around this huge place which is open to public from the church floor to the spire with the bells. Especially one",
          "Its free...its beautifull ....its....huge...images....it takes you back in time as soon as you get in....not sure if you can take pictures I guess you can....only at the museums you are not allowed to take pictures...",
          "when I get there, a lot of policeman are getting ready for the carnival on the ground in front of the iglesia. it was crazy.",
          "Beautiful facade and plaza outside The inside nothing spectacular and no fotos inside. Lots of souvenir shops in the side street but nothing notable.",
          "This church is close to the witch market which is an area packed with attractions. The crurch itself is old and the interior is very well preserved. The outside is really intricate and just looking at the entrance is a treat.",
          "The San Francisco church as it stands today is built on the site of an earlier one which was destroyed during a massive snowstorm that collapsed the building. The tour includes access to the bell tower. English speaking guides are available, though they are provided gratis",
          "San Francisco is a central spot with lots of activities. Nice place to people watch. We had no problems but do get local advice on safety if you'll be there late in the evenings or at night.",
          "I came to the church in the evening towards the end of a service. I only had about 20 minutes inside so we quickly made a round and ended up seeing most of the statues displayed. The day must have been quite sacred beause there was this little candle filled room that people",
          "The church itself is big and is nice to see all the people around it, when I went for the first time there was a graduation going on and it was cool to see the locals there celebrating however the church itself is nothing extra special in terms of architecture or internal",
          "The Church is quite impressive all though a lot smaller than I was expecting. Next door there is a museum with a wide collection of art that was pretty good. I actually preferred the Basilica further up the road.",
          "Really like how the church makes a real effort to educate people on the history of la paz and the region as you tour through the church. They have signs in English, spanish, and French so you know exactly what you're looking at. Definitely go to the bell tower to look out over",
          "Nice place to vista for an afternoon if you get stuck out in the rain. Some nice architecture, gives a brief history of La Paz and has some very nice art work.",
          "It is an icon of La PAz, Life generates around it. The barroque architecture is very pretty and its shear size imposes, The altar is gorgeous. It is a must see.",
          "We first went into the church and that was spectacular. I am non religious but this church is very impressive. It is very ornate with lots of gold leaf adorning the many saint platforms. The alter was beautiful and inspiring. Right next door is the museum. This is a MUST see. It",
          "This church is on a busy street around the corner from the Witch's market. The streets are full of people and there are definitely people harassing foreigners for money. One followed my husband and I so closely and didn't take no for an answer that we eventually paid him to",
          "Maybe the most beautiful structure in La Paz Nice location but be extremely careful as the place is notorious for thieves and pickpockets. Don't go alone but do go. Food in street good and reasonable",
          "A stunning building in the centre of La Paz where you can sit for hours on the steps and watch the locals go about their business. It really was an amazing spot to people watch.",
          "Very impresive church. It\u00b4s a nice place to hang (outside of course), lots of street artists do their shows at the square in front of the church...",
          "We paid our 20 bobs each not knowing what to expect. The church is immense and OTT which had been our experience in most of Bolivia and Peru. You are able to climb up onto the roof via very narrow staircases. This affords views across the rooftops and to the courtyards below.",
          "It is a good place to tour through and you can even go the the roof for a good view of the city. Good history of the city from the colonial view point.",
          "Watched from far = Amazing... Getting inside = Interesting!!. Personally i recomend to visit the church for a little tour, depending of the guide you will just leave the place amazed or with a lot of ( ??? ). I recomend to visit it at morning when you can go up to the bell tower",
          "San Francisco was part of the original hub of La Paz. The church itself isn't as spectacular as other cathedrals, but is a worthwhile visit for the historical significance. For 20Bs you can go through the museum with a guide. Be sure to ask to go to the roof if it isn't",
          "Here is my review of the museum It costs 20 bolivianos and this comes with a Spanish guide, no English. The museum includes the old church. What I like Very spacious English text on the museum pieces Access to church roof and tower Upper view of the church Centrally located",
          "must visit the museum inside and also the main hall, in the courtyard there are usually activities and free walks during the day",
          "... this cathedral does not compare to the European ones. But there is enough to see with nice decorations, so there will be no regrets visiting the church if it's the first one you see. If it's not and you've had your fill of the dolls representing saints/JMJ, no worries",
          "I went to the Sunday mass.. It was in Spanish which I enjoyed. But they also have English mass. The structure of the church is breath taking there's also history of the church in front. Enjoy",
          "San Francisco Cathedral is an Icon in the La Paz, Original Colonial, the lights make it ever more beautiful at night. I LOVE the typical folkloric stores in Calle Sagarnaga next to the Cathedral. A Must visit place and shop.",
          "San francisco's church is located in the touristic area of La Paz's downtown right beside Sagarnaga street. It has a colonial/franciscan style and a big square in front of it, where there are frequent public artistic presentations.",
          "As with many cathedrals around the world, it's going to look beautiful inside and have interesting architecture outside. The Museum is one of those \"must-do\" things in La Paz, so do it.",
          "Beautifull church with great architecture and beautiful wood carvings. have a seat and watch the locals pray and worship.",
          "Very beautiful it's worth visiting it when u are in La Paz! Make sure u go to the restaurant in front it has an amazing view of it",
          "The church was near my hotel so I visited it for an hour one morning. There was hardly anyone there so I was able to take my time. You can't take pictures inside, otherwise I'd have recorded the wine barrels for making wine and pisco! Staff was friendly enough, I had a janitor",
          "I'll begin by saying that I'm not a huge fan of museums to begin with, but I wasn't super impressed with the tour or the tour guide that comes with the 20 boliviano entry fee. You're mainly looking at paintings, which all have descriptions, so I'd personally rather just go at my",
          "This is pretty much the heart of La PAz, and the square to the front is probably the best spot to enjoy the rich hubbub of local life. there are often musical, cultural events held there, and its a great location to head out from to all areas of the surrounding city too. Same",
          "A lovely plain stone church with extraordinary carvings on the east portal and the high altar. I was sorry that the museum was not open on any of the 4 days that we stayed nearby.",
          "They have a guided tour where you can go up the bell tower and have a nice look from the city. Aside from that, the architecture is so beautiful, that you get to admire all other places behind the facade. Entrance for foreigners is a bit higher, but as a local I truly enjoyed it.",
          "it was an interesting church but it is not a must to do in la Paz, pretty similar to the many churches in Peru with mixed artworks",
          "It opens only at 4pm, it\u2019s rather dark inside, and signs on the wall inside indicate that photography is forbidden. The church itself is a fairly impressive structure when viewed from the street, but inside it\u2019s rather plain, as far as catholic cathedrals are concerned. The",
          "The church itself is a lot like a lot of other Andean Cathedrals but it was originally the church of the Indio with the church for the Spanish across the river (now underneath the street called the Prado). There are guided tours that give you some access to parts of the church",
          "We were able to gain entrance to the church although as previously mentioned no photo's. Worth a walk around to see the luxuries inside the church, however if you are lucky enough to have a guide they will be able to explain the history of the church as well as the structure",
          "This place is easy to locate and perhaps the most lively place in the evenings. The church is pretty decent for a visit, no photographs are allowed. The lane next to the church has lot of shops where you can buy souvenirs.",
          "A catholic church with a lot of pomp in gold inside. Outsite many beggar, \"artists\" and tourists until late in the night.",
          "Some may say that La Paz is short on sights, but this is definitely one not to miss. You can only explore with a guide and photography is not allowed (as is the case with many museums in La Paz). The guide was knowledgeable and they have done a good job preserving relics,",
          "Its easy to find and visit in La Paz. My favourite building in La Paz, the rest of the city is a bit bland/run down.",
          "The San Francisco museum is one of my favorites in the city. It offers great insight into the history of La Paz and the country. It's definitely worth a visit.",
          "This 350 year old church is amazing in terms of both history and architecture! It also has a nice museum. Not so much the glass cases full of old things museum, but more of a walking tour which includes the bell tower with a great view of that area of La Paz. Basically,",
          "Old historic church with art museum, tour of bell tower and choir balcony, and plenty of daily street life out front. Several daily masses are held.",
          "Its cheap and the guides give very interesting information, with great paints and rooms. The guides seem really nice and friendly.",
          "Iglesia de San Francisco is an interesting cathedral, but doesn't really stand out from any others. Go to the museum next to it though and you will get a personalised tour around the former convent and can walk up on to the roof for some great views.",
          "The Church is nice, big and is a focal point in La Paz. The 20 bs museum tour is the way to go. Right next door to the main doors for the church. (closed on Sundays). The tour takes you around the inside grounds of the church. The 20 bs includes a guide that helps a lot.",
          "While the church itself is beautiful and worth spending a few moments in, the real gem here is the museum in what used to be the monastery. Completely fascinating glimpse of the history of both the church/monastery, as well as that of the surrounding city.",
          "I would not travel to La Paz to see this church, but if you made it already to La Paz, it's worthwhile visiting this site and its surroundings. Lots of history within (not properly \"packaged\" for tourists, which, in my opinion, is great). Very old construction (for LatAm",
          "Just like all the other churches, not too much different really. Museum next door which we didn't visit but we were in church for a mass and looked around and it's forgettable",
          "This was a pretty church and convent. I think we unfortunately had a new guide who did not seem very well versed in the history which made the visit significantly less interesting. The distillery area was pretty neat. I listened in on another tour and wished we were part of that",
          "Built exactly over the Choqueyapu river where the \u201cSpanish\u201d city ended and the \u201cIndian\u201d city started, San Francisco church is the most important colonial religious building of La Paz. There are plenty of beautiful churches in Potos\u00ed and Sucre, but La Paz has only San Francisco",
          "We went to this museum expecting to see more pictures of Jesus and a church. The price of admission includes a private tour guide (meaning, we walked in and were immediately assigned an English-speaking tour guide), and this tour was excellent! We learned much about Bolivian",
          "Peaceful, interesting history, crypt closed the afternoon we were there but our tickets were good for a return visit.",
          "This is one of the communal hubs in La Paz. You can go to church, take in a puppet show, catch a bus, or try some street food. Just up the street is textile shopping, the witches market, and lots of restaurants.",
          "San Francisco has small cedar altars decorated with gold leaf designs. Candles are not used in churches here because of fire.",
          "Initially I wasn't planning on visiting the Cathedral, but then stumbled upon it as I was looking for the Witches Market. Once inside they provided a guide who spoke English. Usually, I prefer to self-tour, but I was pleasantly surprised by the information I learned about La Paz",
          "This church is centrally located and always teeming with people, especially on the weekends. Interesting colonial architecture.",
          "This place was well worth a visit but for me it was quite religious (I know it is a church but went into a lot of religious detail) It was wonderful that the guide was included in the entry fee and she was very helpful. Would recommend as it is beautiful and is a good way to",
          "One of the most beautiful and impressive colonial church in all South America. But be advised that it opens only after 3:30 pm!!!",
          "The most important historical building of La Paz is the San Francisco church, started in the mid-eighteenth century to replace an old church of the sixteenth century, as the first attempts to raise a temple dating back to 1549. The architect unknown certainly deserves to occupy",
          "I loved to see the church inside, never did it in my life and never imagined it would be so tranquil and peaceful to be inside the building itself. The terrace is awesome for a different perspective of crazy La Paz",
          "Landmark in La Paz. Nice crafting outside, Good for people watching. Nice to see those 'Zebra' helping people crossing the street.",
          "We popped in expecting to see a few examples of silver work and some paintings but were pleased to eb greated by a young student, who in order to practice her English, gives free tours of the monastery and church. She was really knowledgable about the whole place and it helped",
          "A beautiful church, and the best part is that a tour (in Spanish, maybe also in English) is included in the entry price. Our guide was very knowledgeable and seemed to enjoy showing us around and her explanations made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable than just aimlessly",
          "Did a tour. Our guide was very friendly and spoke great English. It was great to hear the history of the Monastery and Bolivia. Out on the roof top you can see the great bells and views of the city. A must see.",
          "Beautiful, among a circuit of really beautiful ornate churches in the area all in walking distance of each other.",
          "There wasn't really much inside. It has a pretty outside, so worth walking to, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go see it.",
          "There is a tour inside that you can do for less than 2 pounds. It's great cause it takes you to the secret areas of the Church. You will be happily surprise.",
          "Heart of the city great old Cathedral well kept. Tour was well worth it and views very pleasant. Would recommend it.",
          "This cathedral gives you a taste of what European cathedrals must have been like before war stripped them of their finery. Colorful and glittering, and filled with worshipers of every class.",
          "Had a great guide to take us around the buildings which were lovely. Great views from the bell tower!",
          "I just enjoyed the concert of a Bolivian youth orchestra in this very special colonial church, with pieces composed by both Bolivian and western composers. Therefore, in this complex you can see some exquisite religious artwork, and visit the museum to get a better understanding",
          "Its a beautiful temple and the museum its amazing, you can stand on roofs and see al the antiques. Its great!",
          "Huge and very old church at the bottom of Sagarnaga street. It is good to see it once or to escape the madness from outside.",
          "This is tipped as one of the most beautiful churches in Bolivia and it certainly lived up to that reputation. I was fortunate to enter the church at the beginning of mass and was able to join in the service and receive a blessing at the alter.",
          "Wonderful, old cathedral in the heart of La Paz, just down the hill from one of the great shopping streets for artisan works. I wish they had been a little more gracious about allowing photographs. Maybe charge a small fee?",

          "It's a nice walk along the Malecon. You'll see lots of shorebirds like pelicans, ibis, herons in the morning and if you are interested in art you'll find more than 10 interesting sculptures. Also very good for morning jogging - you'll even find some fitness equipment on the way.",
          "La Paz did it right. No highrise hotels blocking the beaches from view. It was a delightful change from Cabo,and San Jose del Cabo where most of the beaches are blocked from view.",
          "We stayed in La Paz for 1week . Every morning we went for a run. It was so great to see so many lo calls out enjoying this place. Sunday night it was more festive with families and others out walking, enjoying the entertainment and venues. A must see in La Paz",
          "We very much liked La Paz and nowhere is better to enjoy the local life than the malec\u00f3n, the place to see and be seen. Great for an evening stroll, a drink watching the sunset, an ice cream or dinner.",
          "It's nice during the day, a well done walkway along the foreshore, but can get a bit hot. But in the evening and night the place comes alive with both locals and tourists. They walk, ride, skate along the Malecon or just sit at one of the many restaurants or bars that line the",
          "Malec\u00f2n translates roughly to \"boardwalk\" and this one extends right alongside La Paz Bay for miles. There are a lot of really fantastic statues and it is incredibly well lit at night. Enjoy watching the boats or stop in and grab some food at the local establishments.",
          "Walking the malecon is a personal favorite of ours....always lively! The sidewalks have been spruced up and the streets widened so that there is more parking at the beginning or south end of the malecon.",
          "The Malecon, or break water, runs for approximately 2 KM along the waterfront of La Paz. Walking paths are nicely constructed ( and under construction at the moment) and there are interesting large scale sculptures every few hundred yards. There are numerous bars, restaurants",
          "We started out as a walk down the Malecon and then rented bikes (which I highly recommend). All the restaurants and shops are on one side and the beach on the other! We've been to several Malecons in Mexico. This is one of the best with the fewest peddlers. You can stroll along",
          "A bit under construction on my visit, but still a nice walk and base to head inland and shop and eat.",
          "Very touristie and commercial. Lots of very loud bars and restaurants that just scream \u201cSpring Break!\u201d- which is not at all what we expected or wanted in La Paz. Reminded me, and not in a good way, of R\u00e9volucion Avenue in Tijuana 20years ago, of of Squid Roe in Cabo every",
          "The people the restaurants the shoreline the seaside sculptures. We spent time there everyday of our trip to La Paz. This is a place I want to visit again and again. Boating marinas, scuba diving shops with a low key feel to it all. Personally, I liked it more than Cabo although",
          "Great location for long power walks or for just sashaying along. Many Resteraunts many quaint shops. Lovely view of La Paz Bay",
          "Great place to walk along the ocean side or cross the street and shop the commercial businesses. Sunsets are spectacular. Many social activities are held in this area with various sponsors through out the year. Restaurants all along the strip with various offerings. Tourism is a",
          "Spent my days in La Paz walking half the Malecon in the morning and the other half in the evening. Love the views and people watching!",
          "After our tour with VIP LA PAZ - Wonders of the Sea of Cortez, we drove along the Malecon ; so pretty; lots of interesting sculptures; would have been fun to walk around some if we had more time. I felt totally safe and noticed a few truck loads of armed police officers making",
          "LA Paz Malecon keeps getting better and better! They have expanded the walkway and the food along the boardwalk is the best. I went during Carnaval which is celebrating before lent and it was Wonderful! There was a parade every night with floats, carnival rides, 4 music stages",
          "Great first experience of Mexico. Tha Baja Coast, \u201cthe world\u2019s aquarium\u201d and swimming with Whale Sharks. WILD.",
          "The views were great. The weather was perfect. There weren't really things to \"do\" other than a small playground. But the kids loved the long walk in the fresh air.",
          "This bay front boulevard has been upgraded, and offers a variety of restaurants and shopping for over a kilometer. You can select fine dining, or walk safely off the main street a few blocks to enjoy street vendors. La fuente ice cream is amazing!",
          "Walk for miles. Shops, restaurants,whale museum, exercise and play centers. Stay for hours night or day.",
          "Love the Malecon, it has been refurbished and expanded since my last visit, even better than before. Just a nice place to walk and enjoy the view, people, and environment.",
          "Great place to walk. Lots of sculptures. Very clean with lots of shops, bars and restaurants. We were there in February and they had just had a festival so a lot of the stages and food stalls were still there waiting to be taken away.",
          "A great walk all along the water, cannot be beat! The city is clean and the artwork and path are pristine.!",
          "The art work, sculptures and wall paintings is awesome. Great place to walk as far or as little as you want with lots of options for eating, drinking and entertainment. Awesome during carnival (week before Ash Tuesday).",
          "Malecon is a fun walk during the day - restaurants, shops, and bars on one side of the street and the water on the other. Clean sidewalks, lots of photo ops, sculptures every couple of blocks, and cute trashcans (really! They are decorated with sea lions on top so they look like",
          "Long, long promenade with shops, restaurants and a cycle-way. All with a fantastic view over blue water and blue sky.",
          "Pretty walkway along the bay. People work hard at keeping it clean and we saw improvements being made all the time we were there. Driving along it is a bit of a challenge though....can get pretty busy!",
          "This beach could have so much potential but unfortunately the beach is quite dirty and there is lots of construction going on. I would also advise not to swim here...",
          "The Malecon, which has undergone improvements lately, is a lovely way to experience La Paz. Taking a stroll, particularly on a warm evening, is a relaxing way to spend time. There were many local residents no the Malecon in the evening, particularly on Friday evening. There",
          "The city has been working on the boardwalk and it is looking good. A nice place to walk along the water. You can walk, ride a bike or roller blade. Nice place to relax and have a picnic with the family.",
          "With the recent updating of the Malecon this walkway is spacious and well-lit and a huge bonus for this area.",
          "This is where the tourist action begins. Plenty of restaurant options. We enjoyed breakfast on the beach and dinner while watching the promenade. Night transforms this place into a hot spot for bars and clubs. Had options for pop music and pub atmosphere, lots of outdoor patios,",
          "The Malecon is a beautiful stretch along the shoreline. It is now under renovation and should be completed in four months. A great place where families gather at night to enjoy all the fun there.",
          "Visited the Malecon first week of November. Met with a fair bit of construction as the prepared for the busy season to come. A bit of an inconvenience but I was still able to enjoy myself. La Paz is beautiful, and wasn't too touristy- which I really appreatiated. A great",
          "This bulkhead boardwalk is being completed, and is lovely. Frequent artwork sculptures, wide, used by joggers, strollers, skaters. There is a separate bike path on the street adjacent. Attractive addition to the town.",
          "I love strolling the Malecon especially after 5pm. People are skating, biking, running, and laughing, smiling, and waving. It's such a beautiful place to walk before or after dinner. When the construction is complete, I will be so happy!!!",
          "While we were there a couple months ago it looked dated and worn from salt air. Now they are working hard to update and restore. It\u2019s just a nice place to be near the sea and the town. It\u2019s touristy but not overly so with good restaurants and activities but no hecklers trying to",
          "It will be nice when its finished! Currently (Jan 2018) its undergoing some major refurbishment. Nice statues featured along the way. Lovely views and colours at sunset.",
          "It's a nice place for a stroll, a jog, or even to drive by in your car. I would walk it often and it's just a easemt place and it's nice to look at.",
          "Loved walking the Malecon every evening. Beautiful scenery and access to great restaurants and bars.",
          "Well worth spending an afternoin walking the area. Many great bars and restaurants as well as water activities and cultural destinations.",
          "Nice statues along the way, and the view of the water is nice. But when looking for fresh air, I really found that the fumes from the many cars along the busy road really interfered with any sense of fresh air. In fact I almost got a headache from the fumes. There are one or",
          "There's obviously been an effort to beautify this walkway round the bay. It's looking good so far with neat sections and great statues. It just needs to be finished and some seating provided along what might well become the Promenade to compare to The Prado!!",
          "TheMalecon is beautiful and so pleasant to watch families strolling along together very clean ,\ud83d\udca5wonderful sunset , nice whale shark excursion near by. Organic market couple blocks NE Tuesday and Saturday Am\u2764\ufe0f",
          "Be prepared to walk a long way around this malec\u00f3n ;) I believe about 5 or 6 miles walking, maybe more ? But you will enjoy it . Lost of restaurants , but you will find more little stores on the other side of the Main Street , little market, banks and small jewelry fair",
          "Very nicely done seaside boardwalk with bike rentals and walking paths- good restaurants and ice cream- not great for shopping- safe and friendly",
          "Malecon is pretty depressing for a downtown area. First and foremost, there is one good mexican food place in this entire city...no joke, ask anyone. Second, La Paz is supposed to be an \"up and coming\" area, well it still hasn't even gotten up lol. It's legitimately dead. 1/20",
          "I loved walking along the malecon. Great restaurants and shops. Great place to get a coffee or ice cream and sit in the evening to people watch.",
          "The Malecon is packed with wonderful restaurants, ice cream shops, and coffee shops. I ventured out for five nights and found some wonderful options. Very safe and lots of kids present. The breeze felt great at night. The only thing I would change is the landscaping. It would",

          "Wonderful walk/stroll along the water on the La Paz malecon. Friends and families and lovers and singles stroll for miles daily, especially in the late afternoon/evening. However... this visit the malecon was GONE! Completely torn up for some reason - such a huge",
          "This aerea will be renovated shortly in a very beautiful way. Nice to walk along the oceanside. Good location for relaxing moments. Good bars and restaurants around.",
          "noise, dust, dump truck all day and nights. really disappointed. It appears that nearly the whole distance is being worked on at the same time.",
          "We went to the anthropology museum and it was a don't miss experience...very nice, and cool, and a ban\u00f3, and all in Spanish, so bring your brain, your translation guide, or wing it...great place!",
          "Currently under construction scheduled to be completed by February 2018 for carnival. Looks like it will be beautiful when finished. You still have access to all the stores and restaurants along the malecon however a few detours may be in order. As always watch where you are",
          "ok, this is an amazing walkway right on the waterway in La Paz. However they are in a huge upgrading program right now with 60%of the Malecon ripped up as well as street frontage. Beautiful sculpture every few blocks so this well be awesoem.",
          "We were in La Paz two nights and days after sailing around Isla Espiritu Santos for 2 weeks. The local government is completely redoing the sidewalks - they're wide, flat, and beautiful. There are many restaurants, adventure stores (swim with whale sharks, visit Isla Espiritu",
          "There is so much new construction going on down the strip along the Malecon so when it is completed it will be a beautiful walk along the seaside. It is difficult now because of all the construction. There are still a lot of great photo opportunities and the breeze feels great.",
          "It will be great in a few months, but all torn up when we were there. great restaurants and bars, happening place on Saturday nights for the local youth.",
          "Lots of random loud construction all up and down the Malecon. Beautiful unique bronze statues everywhere. Stop at the Corona beer store for a cheap icy cold beer! We would definitely come back to La Paz once all the construction is complete.",
          "Very pleasant Safe and fun walk along the beach on the Malecon. Families and kids on bikes and skate boards. great sunsets and not too many American tourists. Awesome sunsets!",
          "The coast along the malecon is absolutely amazing, but the malecon itself is nothing to speak of. The sea being the only reason for visiting La Paz, oh, and the food, the shops etc along the malecon are useless, when you walk it, it's the water you want to see!",
          "La Paz is not the prettiest place, but has a great vibe. The malecon is central to this. The view on the sea, the nice statues and the sunny walk past it all are enjoyable. The people selling tours less so, and the beaches aren't really nice as well.",
          "Such a jewel of the Baja, a must do in LaPaz. Walking along the Malecon in LaPaz at sunset or after is such a wonderful thing.",
          "We didn't end up walking much on the malecon but, did spend a lot of time on the store side which is still opened. Much of the street and sidewalk is being worked on as crews install new pipes, sidewalks, parking areas and wheelchair approaches. They are evidently completing",
          "Did a day trip to LA Paz.. their street are under construction .same as San Jose del Cabo. Walked the Malecon a few blocks it was a very warm day and just need to get out of the heat. With the other side of the street pretty much not walkable. we did not stay very long. But",
          "Take a 30 mile taxi ride out to the airport to the resort with the private beach the taxi driver will know the name and the place pure luxury",
          "The Malecon is being upgraded at the moment and so is quite a mess and noisy with the renovations (they seem to work all hours!). However, it is worth the cruise both during the day and evening when there is often a spectacular sunset over the bay. There are some interesting",
          "Major project underway to widen the Malecon and provide more parking. So of course the whole strip is a mess. But they\u2019re moving fast and pouring concrete overnight. They might actually make their December deadline.",
          "We started out walking the Malecon by the 1st pier and stopped by the Marina Hotel. It is a nice walk and the Malecon will be much nicer after all the construction is completed. There is lots to look at and if you are a people watcher you will love it.",
          "We have been to some coastal town all over Mexico, but La Paz is just so special. The Malecon is amazing to experience the real Mexican way of life. On the weekends, this walkway is packed with people, strolling, jogging etc. There is always some sort of event going on,",
          "There was construction when we were there. It seems like some of the businesses on the street had seen a better day. But the views and the artwork were very nice.",
          "Even in the middle of October, La Paz, BC is hot. I was sweating the minute I started walking. I managed to make it all the way to the end and back, and then some, to my RV park about a mile away. The malacon itself isn't anything like my fave, El Boradero, in Colombia, where",
          "6 km walking path in the beach line. Very safe, local peoples dominated, no crowd tourists. Many local restaurants. I enjoyed walking in the malecon. Hope to visit there again.",
          "You can never walk, run or stroll on the Malecon without noticing some new detail, or the touch of a new season. From the beach volley ball players, school children on field trip, art in the making, mixture of all ages of citizens enjoying this pristine city by the sea....the",
          "We walked well over 2 miles of the Malecon. There are numerous excellent restaurants (an Applebee's, really? If I wanted that, I could have stayed home), one great little souvenir-type shop, the Whale Museum, marinas, not to mention a clean sidewalk and a beautiful view. Our",
          "La Paz is serious in bringing attention to it's beautiful and roomy boardwalk. A great walk along the oceanfront. On my visit in Sept. 2017 the other side of the Malecon was being imulated with new sidewalk for miles. What's was surprising is no junk curios stores lined the",
          "Couldn't believe how beautiful the water was.. The people are too sweet. They have a few small shops that make you feel like you are in a small secluded city.",
          "there are LA PAZ letters in there so you can miss them, you need to go and take that picture of you right there! you will like la paz",
          "The Malecon is a beautiful promenade on the Sea of Cortez in La Paz. It's wide, it's beautiful and its well used throughout the week, but on Sundays it's full of families enjoying a stroll. Grandma, Mom, Dad, Teenagers and little kids. Some walking, some skating, some",
          "We enjoyed walking up and down the malecon. This was the heart of the city and all walks of life were walking, biking, roller blading, exercising or just sitting and watching the sun set. Early morning and later in the evening were the best times to be out.",

          "Great place for a wonderful walk, family gathering, for an afternoon run, very clean,lots of security, had a great time",
          "This was the best malecon we visited during our drive along the length of the Baja Peninsula. My wife, myself and our dog found the seaside walk had something different each time we visited. This was a daily destination during our week in the city. Great spot to watch a pick-up",

          "A great place to hang out with the locals. a great assortment of places to dine and shop.We would bike it every day and find a out of the way restaurant to stop at for a treat. There lots of little places tucked away.",
          "I really did not see anything going on at the Malecon. We drove up for the day from San Jose Del Cabo, I loved San Jose Del Cabo a lot better. Don't get me wrong, the ocean was a sight to see.",
          "Really a hidden gem. By far the largest city in BCS. The waterfront is beautiful, especially the clear waist high water that goes out 300 yards before it reaches 2meters. Great for kids to swim in all day. The offer beautiful art and the famous La Paz sign for Instagrammers.",
          "This is a beautiful and scenic malecon (boardwalk) with many lovely statues along the way. There's also a bike path if you like cycling.",
          "I had fun walking along the ocean looking at all of the islands. There are a lot of things to do. Bars, restaurants and shopping. This place is good for the kids also because there places for them to play, playgrounds and museums, I wouldn't recommend going in August it is way",
          "Great street to shop, eat, stroll, swim, enjoy the beach, the sights and the people, tourists and natives alike. Restaurants, cafes, ice cream shops, bars...the whole gamut is on the Malecon.",
          "During the day there is not a lot going on, but at night there are entertainers and food vendors galore. At the very end there is a small workout area that my son and I enjoyed.",
          "We were in Cabo and came to La Paz for the day. Once while parked and once driving the Malecon a cop asked to see my driver's license and then made up a fake traffic violation and said they would not give me back my driver's license unless I paid them $100 US dollars. I said I",
          "La Paz doesn't have a lot of 5 star hotels with fancy lounges and pools facing the ocean. No hordes of American tourists looking for excitement .It's buildings are old, and there are no mega nightclubs with deafening music pounding away all night. This is precisely why we",
          "We went to the Malecon, which is essentially the citys boardwalk. Very beautiful and very call place to go walk during the day. There are plenty of restaurants and things to see. If you go during the day, you might that it is a bit too hot, the locals don't come out until the",

          "We only had a couple of hours in La Paz. This is not your typical touristy town with huge resorts. It's smaller with boutique type hotels in town. The area along the ocean is beautiful, with tour boats, statues, and other pieces of art. Might want to have paceo for shopping",

          "After having a big meal, it's a great place to walk off those calories. Many Mexican families walk at 7pm. It starts cooling down. Only the gringo's walk in the heat of the day.",

          "Lots of stores, restaurants, and bars. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants because they seemed a little touristy, but the people watching was great. I would recommend getting some ice cream from one of the shops, finding a bench across the street, and enjoying the people",
          "The Malecon is a waterfront walk next to the Bay. Best done after dinner downtown. You will find all kinds of people out enjoying a leasurly stride. Well over a mile long in the downtown area. A must if you visit.",

          "The tide goes in and out and the water is actually a bay, so not really ocean front. It's quite lovely and there are a few vendors along the way. Lots of shops and restaurants along the other side of the street. Easy to walk and take in the views and breeze. Can be romantic in",
          "A really beautiful walk along the LaPaz waterfront. Beautiful artwork and lots of great eateries. Take the time to take pictures of the many sea life inspired statues.",
          "I found this an extremely interesting walk, on one side the beach, on the other shops. They have various statues along the way on the beach side, mostly all about the sea. They even have a giant clam shell with a glistening pearl in it! The bins were quite cute as they were all",

          "First, a disclaimer: Some people like this kind of place, I know, and the view of the water is very nice. That said, I would recommend spending your time elsewhere. Like most \"boardwalk\" type places, it is lined with very touristy restaurants, including a couple of American",
          "The malecon is a great place to walk, people watch and enjoy views of the bay. Residents walk, in-line skate, and jog along this walkway. Boats are moored close by and art is featured at various points along the stretch of malecon. The occasional festival will fill Avenida",
          "The waterfront drive and beach is very walkable and reminds one of many such beach fronts along urban centers. Two cautions. It is a long walk as La Paz is not a small town, and remember where you parked if you did find parking!",

          "There are much better restaurants in La Paz than along the Malecon, but it's a great place for a stroll along the beach. It's rare in a Mexican tourist area to be able to walk without hustlers bothering you trying to sell time-shares or junky souvenirs.",

          "Hilariously this is one of the very top things \"to do\" in La Paz. Sorry, just don't get it. It's a long walk along the marina next to the road with lots of very odd statues. The other top things \"to do in La Paz\" involve leaving La Paz either by boat or car up the road to one of",
          "Love the malecon and the views of sunset and sunrise, but as the road runs right along it and it's not that wide you are constantly breathing in petrol fumes. You can walk a little further out on various piers and jetties. I still love it.",
          "Lots of great restaurants; clean streets, friendly people. Beautiful view. Nice walking area. No obnoxious salespeople.",
          "This is in central La Paz and along the water. Across the streets are places to shop, eat, or just relax with a beer or cocktail. It is a long street of walkway, but it is kept clean and easy to manage in an afternoon. You can sit and read or think along the way as well.",
          "La Paz, Baja, Mexico isn't the hottest destination for American tourists, but if you want a working city on a crystal clear Sea of Cortez filled with whales and dolphins, and some of the best seafood in Baja, you won't mind the general disrepair of the sidewalks. Mermaid",

          "Been quite a while since I've been in La Paz - the malecon is huge compared to what it used to be, and the change is for the better. Lots of great restaurants and bars, but family friendly and not a lot of people trying to sell trinkets or tours (unlike other malecons I've",
          "So we drove from Cabo San Lucas and it was quite the drive. We were just not that impressed with La Paz in general. I'm not sure what I was expecting but it wasn't a big city with a walking path on the edge that is up against the sea. I guess I thought it was going to be more",
          "Walked around for hours. great shops good food. Nice people. seemed really safe. will come back again.",
          "As a place to spend some time walking around this can't be beat. We spent most of a half day walking the Malecon enjoying the sights & flavor of this part of the Baja. If you get tired just cross over for a clod drink at the many restaurants & bars. Pleasant & safe.",

          "The Malecon is the thing that, for me, will symbolize our vacation in La Paz. It's an amazingly long seaside path; we didn't walk more than a small part of it but it still stands out in my memory. A broad expanse of blue water on one side, with boats of all sizes out on the",

          "The Malecon in La Paz is about 4 km long, is always full of people walking, exercising, chatting. In the morning we like to walk all the way to the outskirts of town where there is a little open-air gym. On the way we watch the fishermen get ready to go out at sea and the small",

          "Tiled and/or paved walkway along the water, across the street from restaurants, shops, and hotels. Some points of interest along the way. The only issue is La Paz doesn't seem to have an ordinance or rule to clean up after your dog. Lots of families walk along here, people",

          "I enjoy a good malecon as much as the next person and I try to seek them out. The La Paz malecon is on its way to becoming something nice. The more local sculptures get involved, the more enjoyable it will be. I was struck by how close the piers for large ships were to shore,",

          "Turns out Mrs. Walton from the Walmart clan donated the sculpture's along the malecon to the city of La Paz. They are some of the most beautiful, realistic and interesting I've seen in one waterfront collection. I don't say it often but thank you Mrs walmart. Safe day and",

          "I loved the beach and beautiful water. People tried to be helpful most places and my husband speaks passable Spanish. Helpfulness and nice ended when we made the mistake of eating at a place along the main drag called The Jungle. It was handsdown the worst Mexican food I've ever",

          "We looked forward to walks on the malecon, the seawall sidewalk in La Paz. Extending along much of the waterfront, we walked from the north end near Marina Palmira to the south as far as Marina de La Paz. Along the way there are birds to watch, picking morsels to eat.",
          "The malecon looks like it was once a nice walk but the walkway is literally falling apart. The views are ok but not spectacular - there is pretty heavy traffic right along it and the shops and surrounding area isn't much to look at.",
          "This long \"boardwalk\" of tiles is a feature for the city. Attractive sculptures, a wide variety of restaurants and bars, tour companies, beaches, car rentals, even realtors, all along the waterfront, add to the interest and life of this part of the city. Residents and visitors,",
          "The Malecon is a fun and friendly place. On Friday and Saturday nights it was very entertaining to watch local children bike, run, play, laugh, etc. with their families. It also offers great restaurants and dessert shops. I would have loved to try some mexican street food, but",

        "wiki": "Alajuela (Spanish pronunciation: [ala\u02c8xwela]) is a province of Costa Rica. It is located in the north-central part of the country, bordering Nicaragua to the north. It also borders the provinces of Heredia to the east, San Jos\u00e9 to the south, Puntarenas to the southwest and Guanacaste to the west. As of 2011, the province had a population of 885,571. Alajuela is composed of 16 cantons, which are divided into 111 districts.  It covers an area of 9,757.53 square kilometers.The provincial cabecera is Alajuela. Other large cities include Quesada, Aguas Zarcas, Naranjo, Zarcero, Orotina, Sarch\u00ed Norte, Upala, San Ram\u00f3n, Grecia and Los Chiles.\n\n\n== Provincial history ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbia and the arrival of the Spanish ===\n\nCosta Rica has been inhabited for nearly 10,000 years, but little is known of its pre-Columbian history. Alajuela was occupied by several indigenous groups just before the arrival of the Spanish. Despite being between two major civilizations, indigenous groups sparsely populated the area. The Hueteres lived in the south of the territory, while the Botos, Guatusos, Tices and Catapas lived in the north. In the 15th century, most of the region of modern Alajuela was under the control of Garabito, an indigenous leader of whom little is known.  Only the Botos, who lived in Alajuela's northern plains, resisted conquest until the early 1800s.\nStarting in the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Central Valley from Guanacaste. The natives who survived epidemics and conquest were placed in the encomienda system of labor, which exploited natives and funneled money to the Spanish crown. In 1574, the first reservation for natives was created at Santa Catalina, which today is the Canton of Mateo.\n\n\n=== Founding Alajuela ===\nBecause land holdings in Cartago, the colonial capital of the region, were already controlled by large encomiendas, many settlers began moving west beginning in the mid-1600s. In 1657, Alajuela was mentioned for the first time in the writings of Juana de Vera y Sotomayor, a traveler who described an encomienda \"on La Lajuela river.\" Before taking on the name of Alajuela, the area was known as Villahermosa.Esteban Lorenzo de Trist\u00e1n, Bishop of Nicaragua, Nicoya, and Costa Rica, tried organizing Catholic communities west of Heredia. In doing so, he inaugurated a small oratory to unite the scattered settlers. The oratory was centered in the village of \"La Lajuela,\" between the Ciruelas and Alajuela rivers. Because of its creation, the city of Alajuela was officially founded on 12 October 1782. In 1790, the first official parish of Alajuela was established, led by the priest Manuel L\u00f3pez del Corral. The creation of a parish brought more settlers to the region. Soon, they began moving further and further toward the edges of the Central Valley, founding Atenas in 1836, San Ram\u00f3n in 1854, and Grecia in 1856. Soon, the cities of Naranjo, Zarcero, and Quesada were founded as well.\n\n\n=== National independence ===\n\nIn 1823, during the First Costa Rican Civil War, Costa Rica was divided into two groups: the Imperialists, who were loyal to the First Mexican Empire, and the Republicans, who wanted independence. For the most part, Alajuela and San Jos\u00e9 fought against the coup staged by the Republicans in Heredia and Cartago. The Alajuelan side won, and Costa Rica left the Mexican Empire shortly before it dissolved. While Costa Rica was a member of the Federal Republic of Central America in the 1830s, the city of Alajuela was the nation's capital.In 1831, Alajuelan folk hero Juan Santamar\u00eda was born. Santamar\u00eda was a peasant boy who volunteered as a drummer during the Campaign of 1856-1857. On 11 April 1856, Santamar\u00eda sacrificed himself to burn filibuster William Walker's stronghold at Santa Rosa, asking only that his mother be taken care of.Settlement of the northern portion of Alajuela only began in earnest in the later half of the 19th century, and even so did not reach great proportions until the second half of the 20th century, owing largely to the difficult access. Much of the original colonization came from Nicaragua since numerous navigable rivers flow north from their origins in the cordilleras and empty into either Lake Nicaragua or the San Juan River. By 1850, the province had a population of approximately 15,540.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nOn 16 February 1921, Pope Benedict XV issued a Papal bull that reorganized Alajuela into an Ecclesiastic Province run by the incumbents of new two new positions: the Archbishop of Alajuela, and the Apostolic Vicar of Lim\u00f3n.\nA seminal event in Alajuela's history was the 1968 eruption of Volc\u00e1n Arenal. Residents previously referred to it as Mount Arenal. In the years before the eruption, residents reported rises in the temperature of ground water and small tremors. Beginning on 28 July 1969, residents of surrounding towns reported constant tremors. The eruptions began on 29 July, spewing ash into the neighboring provinces and launching boulders into the sky. The initial explosions were so strong that three craters were instantaneously created. The cities of Tabac\u00f3n, Pueblo Nuevo and San Lu\u00eds were buried, killing 87 people. Crops were destroyed and livestock were killed.In 1979, Lake Arenal was created as the result of the construction of a hydroelectric dam by the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, Costa Rica's national electric company. The old cities of Tabac\u00f3n and Tonadora were submerged, and residents moved to the new city of Tabac\u00f3n at its current location, although the steeple of the church can still be seen. The dam produces 17% of the country's electricity.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe province is located in the North Central Plains and borders Nicaragua (Departamento de Rivas, Departamento del R\u00edo San Juan) to the north and the Costa Rican provinces of Heredia to the east, San Jos\u00e9 to the south, and Guanacaste to the west. Alajuela's San Carlos (canton) is larger than the provinces of Heredia and Cartago. It is the largest canton in Costa Rica, taking up 34.32% of the provincial territory and 6.55% of the national territory.\n\n\n=== Mountains ===\n\nThe Central Mountain Range (Cordillera Central de Costa Rica) passes through the province's borders, as do the Tilar\u00e1n and Guanacaste ranges. This province is also home to the two most active Costa Rican Volcanoes: Po\u00e1s Volcano and the Arenal Volcano.\n\n\n=== Rivers ===\n\nIn the northern plains, the San Carlos and Fr\u00edo rivers drain to the San Juan River basin that separates Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The T\u00e1rcoles River, which flows to the Gulf of Nicoya, is known for its crocodile population.\n\n\n=== Waterfalls ===\n|Cataratas del Toro\n\n|La Paz\n\n|La fortuna\n\n|Los chorros\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\nAlthough there are several ecosystems in the province. Two distinct divisions are the Llanuras del Norte (Northern Plains) and the Central Valley highlands. The Llanuras del Norte stretch across several provinces while the Central Valley highlands encompass the middle region of the country. Alajuela's natural environment is one of the primary motivators for tourists coming to the country.\n\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\nCosta Rica is a biodiversity hotspot and Alajuela is no exception. Thousands of species are native to the province.\nNearly a third of the country's 1,400 types of orchids can be found in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, which straddles the border between Alajuela and Guanacaste.Birds such as the quetzal, scarlet macaw, hummingbird, woodpecker, kingfisher, toucan, and three-wattled bellbird are native to Alajuela. There are many species of bats as well, like the spectral bat, Honduran white bat, and the thumbless bat. Many species of insects, including butterflies and moths are native to Alajuela. Because of this, The Butterfly Farm in La Garita was established to further scientific research into the different species.The white-headed capuchin is native to the forests of the province, as is the mantled howler. Other mammals native to Alajuela include Baird's tapir, the giant anteater, the silky anteater, margays, ocelots, and other wild cats. Jaguars, while rarely seen, also inhabit the province's national parks. Deer are native to the highlands as well as the Northern Plains.\nMachaca and bass are two fish found throughout the province. In addition, there are many other species of invertebrates, and amphibians.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTemperature extremes in Alajuela range from 36.6 Fahrenheit (2.6 Celsius) to 95.6 Fahrenheit (35.2 Celsius). The year is generally split into two periods: the dry season, or summer, which goes from December to April, and the rainy season, or winter, which goes from May until November. The winter corresponds with the Atlantic hurricane season, so rain can be a daily part of Alajuelan life. The highlands and the Northern Plains can very greatly in terms of temperature, and precipitation.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nThe base of the Alajuela's economy remains agricultural production. In the southern highlands of the province, tropical ornamentals, coffee, tubers, and green vegetables are the major crops. Toward the north and northeast, rice, corn, pineapple, bananas, and sugarcane are important crops. Alajuela ranks first nationwide in national coffee production and national sugar cane production. Many of the agricultural products are exported overseas.This region has large pastoral areas, especially in the San Carlos area, where there is a significant cattle ranching sector. The cattle industry has spawned production in leather products, milk and dairy products, as well as beef production. The municipality of Upala serves as a supply center for cattle ranchers in the north of the province. Naranjo, so named because \"naranjo\" means orange in Spanish, produces oranges largely for domestic consumption. For a short time in the 1800s, tobacco was a cash crop in the Palmares region, although its production has dropped. There is growing small-scale organic farming industry in Alajuela.\n\n\n=== Industry and commerce ===\nIn recent years, Alajuela has attracted many export-orientated manufacturing companies, especially within the free trade zones around the municipality of Alajuela. Free trade zones include Coyol, Saret, Montecillos, and Bes, among others. Alajuela's free trade zones are mostly industrial in nature. The increase in manufacturing, which began in earnest in 2004, has created strains on the province's infrastructure, including water distribution, transportation density, and electric output. When a hydroelectric plant was constructed in Grecia in 2012, construction upstarts doubled within two months. Industry-related construction accounted for the largest growth. Major companies in these zones include medical equipment manufacturers like Allergan, Baxter, Hospira, and Boston Scientific.Costa Rican lactate conglomerate Dos Pinos is headquartered in Alajuela. Cooperativa de Productores de Leche Dos Pinos exports products throughout Latin America and began exporting to China in 2013. Bebidas Florida, a drink manufacturer with a license to bottle Coca-Cola products, is also headquartered in Alajuela. Other businesses in the province include a butterfly egg and larvae exporter.Several major banks are headquartered in the Alajuela province, including Grupo Mutual Alajuela, and the Costa Rican branches of Scotiabank, HSBC, Banco Cathay, and Citibank. Grupo Mutual Alajuela maintains a secure banking center in the province. There is a large, modern mall in Alajuela located close to the Juan Santamar\u00eda International Airport where many international brands maintain branches. Another mall is being constructed by a Honduran construction firm.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAlajuela has a well-developed tourist sector throughout the province. Tourism is promoted by the Instituto Costarricense de Turismo (ICT) (Costa Rican Tourism Institute), although some Alajuelan politicians would like to see a separate bureau for Alajuela. Alajuela has various national parks including Po\u00e1s Volcano National Park, Arenal Volcano National Park, Rinc\u00f3n de la Vieja Volcano National Park, Juan Castro Blanco National Park, Los \u00c1ngeles Cloud Forest, and Ca\u00f1o Negro Wildlife Refuge, as well as other reserves and protected areas.\nSome of the province's tourist industry is centered on the area around La Fortuna, a small town at the base of Arenal Volcano. There, tourists can visit Arenal Eco Zoo, hot spring resorts, tour a large lake below the volcano, go fishing, and visit nature reserves. The Tabac\u00f3n hot springs, which reach temperatures up to 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit), are a popular destination for national and international tourists.Other tourist centers in Alajuela include La Marina Wildlife Rescue Center, Zarcero, a town known for its public topiary garden. Starting in the 1960s, gardener Evangelisto Blanco began transforming the bushes and cypress trees in Francisco Alvarado Park in the center of town. The town maintains Blanco's tradition and is now an attraction. In Sarch\u00ed, national and international tourists can visit the country's traditional artisan shops. Geometrically painted oxcarts, furniture, and other crafts are some of the artisanal products built in Sarch\u00ed. In the municipality of Palmares, there is a large festival every January. The festival has been going on since 1987 and has live music, horse parades, and other traditional events that attract nearly 20,000 visitors each year. Many visitors and businesses go to San Carlos in April each year for an annual cattle market. Grecia is a common stop for tourists traveling from the Central Valley to the Pacific Coast because of El Mundo de los Serpientes (The World of Snakes), a snake zoo and breeding center founded in 1994.The municipality of Alajuela is also a major tourist attraction. In the center of the city is a centuries-old cathedral with a plaza where mangoes regularly fall from the trees. Known as \"The City of Mangoes,\" there is a mango festival each June. Next to the plaza, there is a museum dedicated to folk hero Juan Santamar\u00eda. This museum is located within the old Alajuela Prison building and as of 1999 encompasses the old city armory, both of which are buildings constructed on the second half of the 19th century. One wing of that museum revives the history behind the Battle of Santa Rosa between Costa Rica and American filibusterer William Walker in 1856, while other sections feature relics and displays from around the country. The museum also portrays the local culture, dedicating a section to local artisans and their works, and public theater events such as plays and lectures.In La Garita and La Guacima, west of the municipality of Alajuela, there are many attractions. The Zoo Ave, established in 1990, is a bird rehabilitation and breeding center where visitors can view and learn about rare birds. There is also the Botanical Orchid Garden which houses dozens of species of orchids as well as other plants native to the region. The Butterfly Farm in La Guacima is another tourist attraction that also exports butterfly eggs and species to scientists and researchers around the world. A popular destination on weekends, many Costa Ricans travel to this region to buy stone ornaments and decorative plants.\n\n\n== Culture and people ==\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nAlajuela takes a central place in Costa Rica's literary tradition, evidenced by the numerous authors raised in the country and commitment to public libraries. There are 14 public libraries Alajuela, more than any other province in the country. The University of Costa Rica maintains children's literature outreach centers primarily in Alajuela, in Grecia, San Ram\u00f3n, Naranjo, Palmares and Zarcero. The municipality of Alajuela frequent holds storytelling contests and festivals, as well.Because of its rich literary tradition, San Ram\u00f3n is often called \"la tierra de las poetas\" (\"land of poets\"). Many poets and authors were born in the San Ram\u00f3n area, including Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Salas P\u00e9rez, Carlomagno Araya, Ema Gamboa, and Feliz \u00c1ngel Salas. San Ram\u00f3n's favorite son is often listed as Lis\u00edmaco Chavarr\u00eda. Born in 1878, Chavarr\u00eda's romantic and naturalist poetry brought him into correspondence with many well-known Latin American authors, such as Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3 and Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Monge. Born in 1915, author and naturalist illustrator Rafael Lucas Rodr\u00edguez was a pioneering biologist in the country. He wrote numerous articles and books, as well as illustrative tracts of Costa Rican flora. Author Fernando Contreras Castro, also born and raised in San Ram\u00f3n, is an internationally recognized author writing in what is described as the \"urban generation\" style. Contreras teaches literature at the University of Costa Rica.Social realist Fabi\u00e1n Dobles grew up in Atenas. Dobles' work concentrates on the plight of the poor in Costa Rica. Dobles, a member of the Popular Vanguard Party, later spent time in prison for his political beliefs. Author Carlos Luis Fallas was born and educated in Alajuela. Fallas' most well-known work, \"Mamita Yunai,\" was based on his time working on a banana plantation. Historian and journalist \u00c1ngela Ulibarri lives in Ciudad Quesada. Contemporary playwright Jorge Arroyo also grew up in Alajuela. His work has been staged in half-a-dozen countries.\n\n\n=== Indigenous peoples ===\n\nMost of the indigenous tribes of Alajuela were killed during Spanish colonization, although the Botos held out until the mid-1800s. Today, the Maleku are one of the only indigenous tribes left from the Spanish colonial period. Their reserve is in northern Alajuela, an hour north of La Fortuna at San Rafael de Guatuso. There are three Maleku villages near Guatuso: Palenque Sol, Palenque Tonjibe, and Palenque Margarita, where residents subsist largely from the tourist economy.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nThere are many higher-level educational centers in the province. The most well-known is Universidad T\u00e9cnica Nacional de Costa Rica (UTN) (Technical University of Costa Rica). UTN was founded in 2008 as the result of the merger of several colleges. It is the fifth public university in the country and maintains five campuses, including three in Alajuela at San Carlos, Atenas, and close to the municipality of Alajuela. The Instituto Centroamericano de Administraci\u00f3n de Empresas (INCAE) (Central American Institute for Business Administration) has a campus in La Garita. INCAE was founded with the help of US during the Cold War with the intention of promoting business education in Central America. The Universidad Adventista de Centroam\u00e9rica (UAC) (Central American Adventist University) is a private Adventist university in Ceiba. The Universidad Santa Luc\u00eda (Santa Lucia University) has a campus in the municipality of Alajuela and San Carlos. San Carlos also has a branch of the Costa Rica Institute of Technology. Founded in 1995, the Universidad de Ciencias Empresariales (UCEM) Business Science University is also located in the municipality of Alajuela. In addition, there are other higher learning centers with campuses in Costa Rica, such as the Colegio Universitario Boston (Boston University College), which is not associated with Boston University, and the Instituto Nacional de Aprendizaje (INA) (National Learning Institute.\n\n\n=== Architecture and public art ===\n\nAlajuela has a rich and diverse architectural history, reflected in the variety of different styles of churches, schools, houses, and public works projects.\nThe municipality of Grecia is home to the Iglesia de la Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Mercedes (Our Lady of Mercy Church), a church constructed almost entirely of sheet metal. The sheet metal was bought by local investors and shipped from Belgium. Today, it is painted dark red. The province is home to many of Costa Rica's historic churches, including the gothic church in Sarch\u00ed, the neo-classical church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Piedades (Our Lady of Piety) in Naranjo, the neo-classical church of Templo San Jos\u00e9 in the municipality of Alajuela, and the wooden church in Venecia. At the beginning of the 1900s, an attempt was made to build a church and monument near the top of Cerro Esp\u00edritu Santo (Holy Spirit Mountain) outside of San Miguel de Naranjo. The church was never completed because of frequent tremors and problems financing its construction. Today, the partially constructed church and amphitheater is a popular tourist stop on the way toward Volc\u00e1n Arenal.Several schools in the province are also national monuments, including the art deco Escuela Jorge Washington in San Ram\u00f3n built in 1931, the neo classical Escuela Pedro Aguirre Cerda in Poas, and the neo-colonial Escuela de Hacienda Vieja. The Escuela Central (Central School) of Atenas is national monument, built of galvanized steel. It is an art deco design that was built in first half of the 20th century.In the municipality of Alajuela, there are three well-known churches. The Ermita de la Concepci\u00f3n en El Llano (The Hermitage of Plains Conception) is one of the only remaining adobe and cane churches left in the country. Built in 1881, a project for its restoration began in 2000. The current site of the Central Cathedral of Alajuela was first blessed as a church in 1790.  It was expanded in 1813, but replaced with the current Cathedral between 1854 and 1863, designed by Francisco Kurtze. In 1888, the red cupola was added based on designs from Swiss architect Gustavo Casallini, giving the Central Cathedral its distinctive look.Also in the municipality are several other buildings from the 1800s, built in neo-classical style. They are directly off the central plaza, including the Antigua Carcel (Old Prison), Antigua Gobernaci\u00f3n (Old Capital), Templo Metodista \"El Mes\u00edas\" (\"Messiah\" Methodist Temple), Antiguo Cuartel (Old Barracks), and the neo-classical Antiguo Instituto de Alajuela y Sal\u00f3n de Actos (Old Alajuelan Government Building). The art deco Escuela Ascensi\u00f3n Esquivel Ibarra and Hospital San Rafael are also within the municipality.\nThe Puente de Las Damas (Ladies' Bridge) built in 1844, is another national monument in Atenas. Stories differ on the origin of the name. According to many people, construction was organized by well-known \"high society\" women, including the widow of former head-of-state Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez Chac\u00f3n, Dolores Oreamuno. Other sources claim the name comes from the nearby planting of cestrum nocturnum, which is often called \"lady of the night\" in Spanish.  In 1853, German traveler Wilhelm Marr commented that the bridge was a \"spectacular mix of nature and art.\" Reconstructed, the bridge still stands on the old highway to Puntarenas, providing an avenue for farmers to transport coffee to the Pacific coast, as it did in the past. Outside of Grecia, El Puente de Piedra (the Stone Footbridge) has given rise to so many folk-tales and legends that it is also a national monument. It is a natural formation that has been complemented to allow visitors to traverse across.\nThere are many examples of public art in the province. Several statues dedicated to national hero Juan Santamar\u00eda. The most famous is the municipality of Alajuela, which was supported and originally financed by the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica. Funding for the statue was first approved in 1887 and it was built by Aristide Croisy, a French sculptor. The statue and the two cannons next to it were installed in 1891. Nicaraguan poet Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo's poem, \"\u00a1Bronce al soldado Juan!\" was inspired by the statue. Also in the municipality are statues dedicated to Pr\u00f3spero Fern\u00e1ndez Oreamuno, Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Mora Porras, Le\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez Bonilla, Miguel Obreg\u00f3n Lizano, Juan Manuel Meo\u00f1o Herrera, Santiago Crespo Calvo (outside the Santiago Crespo Retirement Home), and Francisco de Paula Pereira Matamoros. Opposite the airport is the Farmer's Park, where the Monumento al Agricultor (Farmer's Monument) is located. It was vandalized in 2014, but quickly restored. In addition, there are numerous murals throughout the urban centers of Alajuela, including C\u00e9sar Valverde Vega's in the Cl\u00ednica de Alajuela.\nSarch\u00ed is home to the world's largest ox cart. It is displayed in the central park.Architect Ibo Bonilla was born in Sarch\u00ed. Bonilla designed the Latin American of Science and Technology University (ULACIT), and the Ibero American Hospital, among other projects. In addition, Bonilla remodeled the Central Bank of Costa Rica, the International Bank of Costa Rica, and many cultural spots in San Jos\u00e9, including the Pre-Columbian Gold Museum.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe municipality of Alajuela is home to the Liga Deportiva Alajuelense, one of Costa Rica's most successful soccer clubs. La Liga was founded in 1919 and became a founding member of the Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol (National Football League) two years later. Between 1928 and 2018, La Liga won 29 national championships. La Liga plays at the Alejandro Morera Soto Stadium, which has served as a national stadium and seats 18,000 spectators.\nFrequent Costa Rica First Division teams in the province include Asociaci\u00f3n Deportiva Carmelita which won the national championship in 1961, A.D. San Carlos, and Asociaci\u00f3n Deportiva Ramonense. Other teams include Municipal Grecia, Selecci\u00f3n de Cacao, Municipal Santa Ana, Sarch\u00ed, Selecci\u00f3n de Canoas, Higuite\u00f1a, Upala (Guatuso), and COFUTPA Palmar\u00e9s. Club Deportivo Alajuela Junior existed between 1933 and 1936.\nBullfighting in Costa Rica is less dangerous for animals than in other parts of the world, and Alajuela is no exception. Every January in Palmares, bullfighting is the center of the city's annual festival. In 2013, an amateur rodeo clown was killed while trying to annoy the bulls in the Palmares bullfighting ring. The speedway track in La Guacima is often the site of such bullfighting events. Other smaller events are staged at festivals throughout the province.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nCosta Rica's busiest airport is located in southern Alajuela. The Aeropuerto Internacional Juan Santamar\u00eda (Juan Santamar\u00eda International Airport) is the second busiest airport in Central America. There are other local airports in La Fortuna, Los Chiles, and Upala.\nThe major cities in Alajuela are connected by asphalted roads, be they highways or secondary. The General Ca\u00f1as Highway connects the municipality of Alajuela to San Jos\u00e9 and was the subject of national ridicule when a sink hole temporarily closed it in 2012, causing enormous traffic problems throughout the metropolitan region. The Colon of Mora to Orotina connects Orotina to San Jos\u00e9. The Pan-American Highway runs through the province.\nIn 1926, Alajuela was the scene of one of the worst railroad disasters in history. High above the Virilla River, a train carrying pilgrims to the Virgen de los Angeles derailed, killing 248 passengers and injuring a further 93. Two of Alajuela's defunct railroad stations are classified as national monuments: the Estaci\u00f3n del Ferrocarril al Pac\u00edfico (Pacific Railroad Station) in Orotina and the Antigua Estaci\u00f3n del Ferrocarril en R\u00edo Grande (Old R\u00edo Grande Railroad Station) in Atenas. R\u00edo Grande's railroad bridge is also a national monument.President Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres Olsen closed the rail transportation system following damage during an earthquake and external pressure to liberalize the nation's resources; however, work is underway to reopen the rails. The Instituto Costarricense de Ferrocarriles (INCOFER) (Costa Rican Railroad Institute) is working to reopen the terminals and rails that link Alajuela and the other cities in the Central Valley. It is scheduled to open in 2014. In 2012, a proposal was made to build a train from Alajuela to Cartago but the project never got underway and was eventually scrapped.\n\n\n=== Health services ===\n\nThe entire province is serviced through the Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social (Caja) (Costa Rican Department of Social Insurance). Cities and towns of significant size have Equipos B\u00e1sicos de Atenci\u00f3n Integral en Salud (EBAIS) (Basic Medical Attention Center) facilities. In addition, one of Costa Rica's largest hospitals, Hospital San Rafael, is in the municipality of Alajuela. Grecia is home to the Hospital San Francisco de As\u00eds, built in 1858 by Ram\u00f3n Quesada. Hospital Los Chiles is the northernmost hospital in the country. The old hospital in Quesada, built in the first half of the 20th century and no longer in use, is a national monument.\n\n\n=== Other public services ===\nLike the rest of the country, nearly half of the water services are provided by the Instituto Costarricense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (AyA) (Costa Rican Institute of Aqueducts and Sewers).  Water service did not arrive to the northern city of Upala until 1976, but it was recently bolstered in the northern cantons of Los Chiles, La Urruca, and Coquitales.National trash collection is governed by the 8839 Law (Gesti\u00f3n Integral de Residuos S\u00f3lidos). The municipalities of Alajuela, Atenas, Grecia, Naranjo, Palmares, Po\u00e1s, and San Ram\u00f3n have collective trash removal services.Electricity did not arrive in the northern part of the province until the 1978. Grecia is home to a new hydroelectric plant, constructed in 2012. The hydroelectric dam at Lake Arenal generates between 12% and 17% of the country's electricity. There are a growing number of wind turbines that generate electricity in the province, including a plant at Tierras Morenas.\n\n\n== Political divisions ==\nAlajuela has 15 cantons.\n\nCanton (Head city)\nAlajuela (Alajuela)\nSan Ram\u00f3n (San Ram\u00f3n)\nGrecia (Grecia)\nSan Mateo (San Mateo)\nAtenas (Atenas)\nNaranjo (Naranjo)\nPalmares (Palmares)\nPo\u00e1s (San Pedro de Po\u00e1s)\nOrotina (Orotina)\nSan Carlos (Quesada)\nZarcero (Zarcero)\nSarch\u00ed (Sarch\u00ed Norte)\nUpala (Upala)\nLos Chiles (Los Chiles)\nGuatuso (San Rafael)\nR\u00edo Cuarto (R\u00edo Cuarto)\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nGabriela Tra\u00f1a, Olympic marathon runner\nAlejandro Morera Soto \u2013 Barcelona soccer player\nJuan Santamar\u00eda \u2013 hero of 1856\nIbo Bonilla Oconitrillo, sculptor, architect, and teacher\nJulio Acosta Garc\u00eda, 24th President of Costa Rica\nAnastasio Alfaro, zoologist, geologist, genealogist and explorer\nFernando Contreras Castro, Novelist\nLe\u00f3n Cort\u00e9s Castro, 28th President of Costa Rica\nCarlos Luis Fallas, writer and Communist leader\nRafael Lucas Rodr\u00edguez, biologist, botanist and artist\nJose Figueres Ferrer, first president of the new republic\nJuan Alfaro Ruiz, hero of 1856\nEdgar Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, sculptor\nGustavo Sol\u00f3rzano Alfaro, poet, essayist, editor and teacher\nLisimaco Chavarria, poet, \"favorite son\" of San Ramon\nGrecia, the first toucan to receive a prosthetic beak.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Alajuela Province at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Poas Volcano is a very cool visit when the view is clear. Go EARLY in the morning!!! However, since the recent eruption the trails have been closed which is a bit of a bummer. It's also a drag that one only has 15 minutes at the caldera edge.",
          "I feel so badly when I read the reviews of people who did not get to see this spectacular sight because I know we just got lucky. I actually paid a little extra for these ease of booking my tickets through viator instead of the park. You have to know you are taking a risk",

          "Given the fact that you can just stroll upward a mile to the one and only viewpoint - every other being closed off - this was a disappointment. You get one great view if weather is good (it was for us). Besides that: no documentation and information and no flexibility at all",

          "All we saw at 11:30 were dense clouds that filled the viewpoint. GO EARLY! Unfortunately, you need to book early which means its a crapshoot. Live cameras at 8am showed the crater was completely in view so we made a reservation; however, the earliest time slot available was",
          "This was a stop on tour. It was great to stand and look down into an active volcano. Just remember that the weather can change at any time. When our group got to the crater it was clear and you could see all the way across. By the time our 20 minutes was up the crater was",

          "It\u2019s an amazing adventure to be standing on the edge of the very crater of a volcano, staring down in the poisonous smoking lake at the bottom. Nothing else in the world looks like this. You can only buy tickets online (a youtube video shows you how), and you can only go by",
          "Make sure you book your visit in advance (check with your hotel desk) and go as early as you can. It is very impressive if it is not covered with clouds.",
          "We went first thing in the morning and we could see everything! The view was amazing, and it was really something to see the chunks of concrete missing on the observation deck from when the volcano erupted. Well worth the drive up there. Stop on the way back for some local food,",
          "I love visiting Costa Rica and I admit I love to revisit places. I have not been back to Poas Volcano since it erupted two years ago. Some things have changed like the fact that you have to purchase a voucher before you go. I find this VERY annoying. This being said -",
          "Travelling across Central America, we visited Poas Volcano National Park. The place is particular, with a short walk uphill to the view platform, and you see a crater - a living, bubbling and smoking green lake beneath and smell infernal smokes. It is allowed to stay there only",
          "My husband and I heard that the volcano was now open again. We decided to make a reservation and see it as we were nearby. We were so glad we took the time to stop. We arrived 20 minutes earlier than the time of our reservation. Glad we did as our group started to walk up to",
          "We watched daily till we had a clear day. Headed out and had a clear view of the volcano. Brilliant teal blue, hard to believe it's real. Great rain forest walk, this is a must see and do.",
          "when we visited the volcano there was virtually no line and it wasn't busy! the hike to the volcano was rather long but so fun. semi clear skies and worth the chance of walking there to see if the volcano is visible.",
          "Our visit to Poas was worth the one and half hour wait at the booking station. We where told by our guide that the crater is often obscured by the clouds however we were very lucky and got a fantastic view. The booking system was quite inefficient though. Be prepared for delays.",
          "The day started out perfect, clear skies and a little cool. The drive to the park was fantastic. After a small period of time after arriving we met some fellow travelers and off we walked to the viewing area. Upon arriving at the crater view a gentleman was discussing the",
          "As with most high-altitude volcanic craters, it's always a 50/50 chance on if you will actually be able to see anything once you're at the top looking into the crater. In my case with Poas, we were greeted with nothing but dense clouds and the smell of sulfur. Of course this is",
          "I visited Poas the day it blew up in April 2017 (I missed it by a few hours thankfully). So I had to return to see it again. Limited numbers are now in for 20 minutes. Reservations must be done online (it is not done easily). Hardhats are worn. A guide (enforcer) leads",
          "You must register on -line if it has not crashed. Otherwise we were able to get reservation at Mirador restaurant down the hill from volcano with passports and credit card. $15 pp. We got there early otherwise the crater is covered in clouds. The blue color is from sulfuric acid",
          "If you are lucky you can see it through the clouds. It is closed due to activity. Beautiful landscape scenes during the drive into the area so it would not be a total loss. Waterfalls and lush forests abound in the area. Enjoy your trip",
          "We couldn't drive up to the volcano today because it has been closed for about a year due to volcanic activity. We were told it may open in the next couple of months. Be sure to check whether it is open to save yourself a trip.",
          "We enjoy our trip. and I would recommend to anyone to please come and see this Volcano. Pura Vida Costa Rica !",
          "A short ride from downtown San Jose, highly recommended going in the morning to avoid getting a cloudy view. Admission is based by vehicle. There are a few hiking trails (moderately easy to easy) that we went on, took us a good 2-3 hours!",
          "We were very excited to visit a volcano in Costa Rica, however the entry fee was quite expensive for a short walk to look at a crater (15 USD per person), and the day we went it was foggy and you could barely see. The whole excursion after paying the fee was 10 minutes. If you",
          "The Poas volcano has been closed for over a year but the website does not tell you! Still worth it to drive up the mountain, lots of other things to do and it\u2019s beautiful up here!",
          "The park is closed to visitors due to an eruption last year which damaged the infrastructure around the volcano. We were with a bird watching group and the security guard gave us permission to walk along one of the lower paths for 45 minutes only, which we were grateful for. We",
          "The volcano is still closed and so is parts of 146. I feel sorry for the businesses in the area because they are definitely suffering from this closure.",
          "Beautiful drive up, but they had the road blocked 2 km from the parking lot, due to volcanic activity. I guess it is a volcano, but there could have easily been a sign at the bottom of the road. Bummerrrrr.",
          "I would pass on stopping here and since it's not free, I am inclined to recommend that you put that money towards the La Paz waterfalls as you will have a better experience there. Not to detract anything about the value of culture, history and the education that Paos brings to",
          "Travelling to Poas is a mixed stuff. You have to drive through beautiful scenic areas. Then hike through rainforest areas and then you will be on the crater. If you have more energy then please hike down to lake as well. It is beautiful to experience.",
          "a lot of visitor complain about the entrance fee - you know in advance that it cost $ 15.00 per person and $ 2.00 for the parking - so not really fair to complaint about it! We had a sunny day and could see the little lake in the crater. For someone interested in a Volcano it is",
          "This volcano is currently unavailable for visits as of March of 2018 because of active volcanic activity. But visits to the coffee plantations and La Paz waterfalls are a good alternative.",
          "Don\u2019t go: park is closed because of an eruption in 2017. Local information says it will be open again in 2019... We, stupid tourists, didn\u2019t knew and also guides from other parts of the country weren\u2019t informed about this.",
          "It\u2019s one of the most popular short trip in Costa Rica. volcano, animals, it\u2019s a great place to get to know Costa Rica.",
          "Good visitor center, great view of the crater, and some easy hikes through the cloud forest. Caveats: The park is currently closed because of volcanic activity - check before you go. Also, this is cloud forest, and it is often raining or fogged in to the point you can't see",
          "Please be advised that the park is currently closed. The drive can still be fun, the strawberries are amazing, coffee plantations picturesque and shops fun but you will most likely be turned back prior to making it to the entrance to the park.",
          "It was a scenic drive and I believe worth having a look see. I had never seen a volcano so a new experience. Wear walking shoes. Clouds come and go so worth staying a while to view the scenery.",
          "Volcan Poas is a great day trip in the central valley. The main crater is amazing, and hiking through the cloud forest to the lagoon is beautiful.",
          "Got there and just like Irazu volcano the price of the entrance fee is $5 more than what it is on the internet. But the view is amazing. You have to come early to watch the lake surrounded the volcano. I came at 10 and the mist already covered it. But I stayed till 11 in the",
          "It was a good drive up to the point that visitors are allowed. The drive was a good introduction on what to drive going to La Fortuna and Monteverde - zigzag. I got my driving practice using the 4-wheel drive technique on this road. The resting area's view was beautiful.",
          "The park has been closed since April 13, 2017 due to increased and unpredictable volcanic activity; the latest update is that officials were petitioned on October 23rd to reopen the park since the volcano had been quite for several months. The decision whether to reopen or not",
          "The volcano was closed but just the road up the hill is amazing ! we stopped for very good coffee and to admire the beautiful view.",
          "This is most definitely a MUST SEE! Its a view so breathtaking with the skyline so close its amazing. Be prepared to be awwed! Bring a light jacket or sweater as it does get a little cold up there & make sure to have your camera ready. You will not want to miss out on snapping",
          "The drive up to this volcano is amazing in and of itself. We stopped for some amazing coffee at a location on the way and we were able to overlook the coffee fields just as the mists came in. Was amazing. You have to try the strawberry jam at one of the roadside stands, legit",
          "An unique experience that everybody need in their life! If you are in Costa Rica try to visit this National Park. P.S: The volcano has been showing volcanic activity, so some days the park would be closed to visitors. My recommendation is to contact the park office to know",
          "After 2.5 hours driving, we arrived at Poas to find it had been closed due to volcanic activity since April this year. No info on the closing on google or TripAdvisor.",
          "I had 3 days in San Jose before boarding the Okeanos Aggressor for Cocos and took 3 excursions. The best trip was on the 2nd day to Doka coffee plantation, Poas Volcano, and La Paz Waterfalls. The Poas main cauldron was eerily beautiful, stark and moonlike. It was a modest hike",
          "I heard it was closed. Before I decided to go there, I asked the staff who works in my hotel whether it is open or not. The staff told me it opens all around year. But when I got to Alajuela to transfer the bus for the volcano, the driver said it is closed for 4 months. I just",
          "The Poas Volcano is a must see while in Costa Rica. I visited this volcano as part of a combined tour with a coffee plantation and waterfall gardens. Up top, you are literally in the clouds. Once the clouds clear the view is amazing.",
          "A wonder of nature you can not miss, walking up the slope, watching eye-catching Costa Rican flora and colourful birds, and that gigantic lake on the volcano with the clouds that cover and uncovers it like magic. Awesome!",
          "It's perhaps the most beautiful volcano I've ever visited. The lagoon nearby is beautiful, too. My husband and I drove up to Poas ourselves. We used Waze for navigation and the volcano was easy to find. We were able to park quite high up there right beside the tourist center. It",
          "Currently this is closed to the public due to it being active and not safe. If it is open when you are there it's a beauty but, may not be visible due to the clouds",
          "We headed on our way to Paos Volcano on June 22,2017. The roads we very windy and the view spectacular! Not for the faint of heart. We could see the volcano despite the clouds. Unfortunately, we could not get all the way to the top because the road was blocked due to volcanic",
          "The day tourned out to be clear and sunny at Poas!...We were blessed to have this great view of the volcano!....a month later the volcano was active!",
          "MUST GO!! Try to head there around 11 am , we waited for a long period of time, it was totally worth it at the end.. simply be patient and you'll be lucky",
          "Although we went there very early in the morning the road to the volcano was closed due to eruption took place a month ago. So check volcano possition before you go there.",
          "The walk up to the volcano is easy. Go in the morning! We were lucky enough to make it to the mountain early enough in the day before the clouds blew through, and definitely worth the trek.It's great for a picture and you'll only stay a few minutes.The 2 craters are spectacular.",
          "If you have time this is worth the drive. About 1 hr from the airport. The drive up to the volcano was beautiful passing a lot of coffee fields and fruit stands. The walk to the crater is not too bad and seeing the gasses coming out of the crater was pretty cool. There is",
          "The cloud was early the day we visited Poas. The kind lady at the ticket booth made sure we understood there was only a 50:50 chance of seeing the crater before she sold us a ticket. Parking is paid separately (which threw me - and someone different checked our parking receipt",
          "We were expecting to visit this National Treasure while in Costa Rica but it is now closed, May 2017, due to activity. Check for availability before planning!",
          "If you are planning a trip to Poas Volcano please check to see if it is open prior to traveling. The park has been closed since the first part of April and is not expected to reopen anytime soon.",
          "There is a lot to see in the park, including the drive up the mountainside. We bought fresh fruit and passed by coffee fields. The trail is very gently with rolling up and down. Lookout destination is a must over the smokey blow hole. The lake is less interesting as you can",
          "We were really excited to see Poas Volcano, but we knew it was closed due to the eruption at the beginning of April. We received some misinformation that you could still see the volcano from the highway, but this was totally untrue. Keep checking with locals to see when the park",
          "This was for sure an unforgettable experience, from the drive through the countryside to get here, to site itself. It's a great spot to admire nature and fully relax. I loved it!",
          "Costa Rica is blessed with volcanos and Poas volcano is great for a day trip. There is a scenic walk from the info centre before you reach the amazing viewing platform. There are also a few walking trails.",
          "We went to view the Poas Volcano. Pretty impressive with steam and gasses coming out of the crater. (a few days AFTER our visit...it erupted!) IF a person has any kind of respiratory issues, best to stay back. After standing and looking for a short while, we could taste the",
          "Definitely one of the most beautiful and amazing volcanoes in the world, now it is active and the park is closed but, you can also visit places around like Vara Blanca, Poasito and Waterfall Gardens. Once you can, come a visit the largest geyser type crater in the world.",
          "Really bummed. Park is closed indefinitely due to eruptions..... :( it started erupting on April 17th with a large eruption that has destroyed plants and parks of the park. Was told all animals have fled too.",
          "It is important to get there early. Even on the perfectly clear day we had, within a couple hours the clouds were starting to come up the mountain and pour into the crater. It is stunning though, and still smoking! You only need about 3 hours for this visit.",
          "I was excited to see a volcano, and thought it would be cool. It blew my mind! It was so surreal looking into a volcano and be above the clouds! We also walked another trail through the micro cloudforest and saw the extinct volcano that's filled with rainwater. There were a",
          "We have visited the Poas Volcano in the Central Valley area of Costa Rica four times taking visitors who vacation with us at our home in Grecia. The drive is amazing along with the views, restaurants, shops, etc., on the way to Poas is perfect for the tourists, also within a few",
          "I've been to at least 7 or 8 Parque Nacionales in Costa Rica, most with at least one volcano to hike or view. Po\u00e1s, however, is the only one that you can look down into. Get there with time to complete your view and walk BEFORE 10 AM. Chances are good that before then you'll",
          "Apparently the biggest thing to know about the Poas Volcano is when to go. You need to go early in the day before the clouds set in. Once they set in, you cannot see anything. We were extremely lucky when we visited because we were viewing the caldera as the clouds started",
          "If you're planning to get to the crater, you should probably hit the road early in the morning. Later the place gets very cloudy and you won't be able to see anything. We went there with a rental car and it was perfect. The Blue Lagoon is worth the walk, so don't feel",
          "We stopped at the Poas Vulcano at our drive from the San Jose Airport to the Vulcano Tenorio further north. It was Monday and we arrived there around 2.30 pm. It was a clear day and not too many people there. From where you parked the car (parking fee and entry fee - not sure",
          "We visited Poas on the morning of April 11th and were lucky to have a clear day. The volcano had been active for 10 days so it was an interesting sight. Some new areas were bubbling up and it looked as though some eruption might be imminent. In fact, they closed the volcano",
          "This was our very first sightseeing trip after arriving in Costa Rica for business. We visited Poas on a Sunday morning as it's best to get there early in order to have proper weather for having good visibility at the crater area and also to avoid a long line of cars waiting to",
          "Poas is one of the most visited national parks of Costa Rica. It tends to be more enjoyable in the early morning, before clouds may get into the crater and make your experience quiet miserable. Avoid buying from the souvenir shop and cafeteria. Drinks are mainly imported from",
          "Wow!! geology in action right there!!! We were so lucky to see this as we went on the 5th April... then we found out it erupted on the 12th and 13th and was closed to public after that! Its an amazing sight - smells of Egg soup!! Go early - get to the volcano before 10am and",
          "We were among the first to arrive at the volcano and had to wait in a line of cars for it to open. Despite the particularly warm temperature at lower altitudes, we were happy we had a change of clothing (pants, jackets, socks) to weather the cold and wind at Poas. After a",
          "What an amazing sight. Let's just say we both went \"Wow\" - and that was from the viewing area maybe half a kilometer away from the volcano. There were quite a few people but it didn't seem too crowded and did not detract. Easy walk in, park set up well with ongoing",
          "Great experience of seeing an active volcano and very nice hiking in the park. Various options to fit to different ages.",
          "In itself, the trip up to the Volcano is an experience. The cooler and fresher air, the changing landscape and nature with cows grazing on the hillsides. Vendors at the sides of the street selling strawberries, flowers,fruit and cheese. You get a spectacular view over San Jose",
          "This location is close to San Jose, so it gets a lot of visitors. It is worth visiting, but it can be crowded. You have to walk 10 min. to get to the viewpoint and cannot stay long there because of the fumes. Not much to do, but very nice view of this lake. The longer trail to",
          "We utilized a Private Tour Guide, who made this an informative and stress free experience. When we say luck is involved, we mean that depending on the weather conditions and wind, you may or may not even see the crater. That being said, luck was on our side that day and we had a",
          "You need a relatively clear day, an early start to avoid long lines and the ability to hike up a moderate incline however the landscape and the view of the volcanic lake are well worth it.",
          "Short trip out of Alajuela, easy hike on well-managed footpaths to see the volcano, the old crater and surrounding jungle. Would recommend going in the AM before the cloud cover rolls in for the day. GORGEOUS views, definitely a must-see in the area.",
          "I really had a mixed feeling about the volcano that had been much written about. First. WAYZ estimated the trip to take 40 minutes longer than it actually took, so we got there before the gate opened on a Sunday morning. The two-stop ticket booth is confusing: the first took",
          "Getting there is a traffic nightmare. Once you get there, you have a twenty percent chance of not seeing anything. If you go in the summer, the rain and temperatures are a treat. Some great views driving up and you will see many coffee plantations. Not the serene and pura vida",
          "This place is a must visit, you can actually see the volcano from close, great one time experience, drive was amazing. I would defiantly recommend everyone to visit this place.",
          "Lots to see during the drive through the small towns; the crater itself is a short 5-minute walk from a vistors center. Seemed a bit commercialised compared to the unspoiled nature of most of the rest of our trip. A nice circular path goes past it for about 30 minutes back to",
          "Unique and very interesting outing! Active volcano with strong sulfur smell (anyone with breathing issues might want to wear a mask).",
          "Thankfully the day we visited this volcano was bright and sunny so we could see the crater clearly. We could see a light trail of smoke rising from the crater! Bring your binoculars. The view of the volcano and its surroundings are gorgeous! So glad we decided to see it!",
          "We were staying in the area, so we decided to visit one morning. Traffic going up wasn't great as there was a bike ride/race going on that morning. When we got to the ticket booth, the lady told us it was very cloudy and we only had a 50-50 chance of seeing anything. It seemed",
          "The drive to the park from Alajeula was spectacular. We were treated to great views of the countryside and a myriad of little local restaurants that we wanted to eat at. :) We arrived at the park by 10:30am, hiked the short walk to the crater and enjoyed about 30 minutes of",
          "Came late.. Afternoon and saw nothing.. The creater was all covered with clouds. The park is very small, took us less than hour to walk all trails . 15 dollars is way too expensive for this experience!",
          "I ve been comong to Costa Rica for the fourth time and this time I made it. Went to visit the volcano. The road to the volcano is more beautiful than the volcano per se. Nice landscapings, until you get to the park. Walk 600 mts and there you are. This time it was full of smoke",
          "we stopped here on our drive from arenal to san jose. beautiful ride. eat at the EL DESCANSO restaurant near the park if you are hungry. well, we drove all the way up to the entrance, and the guards told us we wouldn\u00b4t be able to see anything because the clouds were too thick.",
          "Was a great day to see the whole view. It is an easy drive and hike to see the crater. So, no reason to skip this. The cafe is overpriced",
          "We checked out this volcano the first day after we landed in Costa Rica. We had a rental car. It was an interesting drive from Alajuela to Poas. Quite uphill on the countryside with windy roads. Good fun though! We arrived at 730am, we were early and waited at the front gates",
          "Went early on a Sunday, excellent views, bright, warm day with no cloud. Worth going for the view. But advise go early as major traffic jams to get into the Park",
          "We were in the Alajuela area and wanted to see the volcano. We were told to get there early ( before 10 am) because the clouds come in and obscure the view of the crater. It was a gorgeous day with clear skies down in the valley . We left later than planned, drove the road with",
          "Worth visiting but you have to be lucky with the weather as I understand the volcano is regularly covered in cloud. We were lucky to see the lower lake and crater for a few moments but the cloud did not lift from the upper lake.",
          "We just visited Costa Rica last week. Our hosts, who live near San Jose, strongly recommended a trip to the Poas Volcano. The volcano overlook is about 1/2 mile hike from the parking area. But worth it. The walk is slightly uphill but not strenuous. They have just competed a new",
          "Love the experience here!, So magical ! Highly recommended if you visit Costa Rica!!! So memorable place.",
          "We visited Poas Volcano on a day trip from our hotel in San Jose. Gorgeous scenery surrounds the volcano. We were lucky enough to visit on a bright sunny day (note: you'll still need long trousers and a fleece). Our guide told us that we were very lucky as there's only a 10%",
          "Unbelievable views of the crater of the volcano from the visitor center. There is a walk from center to the viewpoint which is at an elevation of over 8000 feet. When we got to the viewing point, it was very cloudy obscuring all the view. We waited about ten minutes and",
          "Was super excited about this stop, but the weather just didn't cooperate. All I could see was fog. Bummer because it sounds awesome.",
          "We spent our only full day in San Jose sightseeing out of town, but we utilized our time well! First stop, Poas Volcano. We were fortunate to have a clear view and, while I won't say that this is on my top lists of sights in the world, it is definitely something to say one has",
          "We were afraid of what many reviewers said about clouds, so we decided to forego the morning rush and take our chances on a Friday afternoon. Call it luck or perhaps afternoons have better chances, but it was perfection. First, very small crowd (presumably because everyone",
          "Even though it was cloudy, this was an amazing view of the volcano. The clouds parted periodically, and I could see the lake in the volcano! There were also some hiking trails that we didn't get the chance to fully explore -- but I'd love to go back!",
          "we hired Maleku Tour guides/owners, Eugenia and Geiger, to take us from Atenas to Poas volcano. As always, they arrived on time and personalized our excursion with a trip to Dakar coffee estate and Sarchi. THey are so knowledgeable and accommodating, friendly and warm. Poas was",
          "We were lucky enough to see the crater and then after an up hill walk we saw Botos Lagoon. We now hear that the best time to see it is early morning but we arrived about noon on a sunny day. We saw the main crater then Botos by the time we got back from the lagoon, the cloud",
          "We booked this tour through viator. It was worth every penny. We were fortunate enough to have a clear view of the crator. We then hiked up about 20 minutes to the second site the lagoon. Wasn't as nice as the crator but still beautiful. Well worth it in my opinion.",
          "Well we were unlucky, an hour later it was probably great. When we arrived at the crater rim the sight was perhaps five meters. Not very exciting, but the cloud forest was enjoyable to walk in.",
          "We visited Poaz volcano as part of a full day tour, and this was the most disappointing stop of the three locations (the others being Doka coffee plantation and La Paz waterfall gardens, see separate reviews). While the weather and visibility was actually good when we left the",
          "My husband & I were very fortunate to be able to view the crater & large lake from the viewpoints. We got there early in the morning and spend a couple of hours there. The first time we went to the viewing area to see the volcano you could not see anything however we went a 2nd",
          "It's a decent walk on a clear day especially in the morning before the tour hordes rock up. The old caldera is a bit of a bore and some of the trails were closed due to recent erosion (the entry price was funnily still the same...) Take your own water and food as the cafe is a",
          "When we arrived, the whole area was covered in cloud so we were prepared to be disappointed. Whilst we were on the viewing platform the clouds parted briefly and we had a quick glimpse of what lay below, which was glorious. We went over to look at the explanation board to sort",
          "We went a year before and saw nothing due to the weather and sulfer in the air, This year we arrived early when park opened with knowledge of clear skies and it was spectacular. Even with obscured views the park is still worth the trip. Nice hiking paths and a wonderful info",
          "The Poas Volcano trip we took was ultimately a disappointment because Mother Nature intervened. The ride up to and back was visually impressive. We went from 3000ft in San Jose to 9000+ with great views of the valley. The park is beautiful and the visitors' center has food,",
          "Awesome!! Go early in the morning; dress warmly as the altitude can make it cold. Wear sneakers (LADIES!!!!)",
          "We drove up and got there before 10 am as recommended. Unfortunately it was raining. We paid the US15 per person to enter the park and the parking fee anyway, but the longest trail was closed. So we did a very short walk to the crater where we could not see anything and the",
          "We have visited Volcano in April 2016, and were unlucky as all other trails were closed due to the maintenance. So it was just a walk to volcano and back for $45 as we were a family of 3. On the top of that they charged us separately for the parking, which was another $10 i",
          "We got there first thing in the morning when the park opened (8am) and had the whole place almost to ourselves for about an hour, and then the crowds began to arrive, so I'd recommend going early! It's an easy walk and a spectacular view. Definitely worth the trip.",
          "We were lucky and got to the top of the volcano before clouds rolled in. View was pretty of San Jose and the lagoon and view into the volcano were nice but unspectacular.",
          "This was the second stop for the 3 activity tour we booked. It was a clear day and we saw the entire volcano and all around it. Tons of locals were there and the walk is nice and easy to the volcano look out point. It's all paved. There are bathrooms halfway there and I",
          "The drive up the mountain is interesting as you'll get a good snap shot of the local life. The walk up to the volcano is easy. It's great for a picture and you'll only stay a few minutes. I'd recommend to also walk to the lagoon, good for another picture and it's an easy 15min",
          "Go in the morning! We were lucky enough to make it to the mountain early enough in the day before the clouds blew through, and definitely worth the trek. The road up isn't too bad and we made sur to stop at a local caf\u00e9 plantation and stop for strawberries on the way down -",
          "We had the opportunity to visit Poas Volcano. Getting up early to get there before the clouds rolled in was well worth giving up a little sleep! Try to arrive before 9:30-10:00am to get a clear view of the crater. By the time we finished the walk to see the lake the crater was",
          "OMG!!! this is so incredible! to see a volcano from so close without having to hike for hours is great! the view is so great! there was no cloud so it was perfect. it's a bit cold and windy so make sure to come dress for the occasion. If you are in the area, please don't",
          "We drove to the volcano and parked in the car park. The 2 craters are spectacular. The weather was perfect and the second crater had mist rolling in and out. They have just finished completely refurbishing the trails and viewing platforms so its all very easy to access. If you",
          "Situated about an hours drive from San Jose - firstly through busy local roads, route 1 and the congested Alajuela area. Eventually you will move on to good quality country roads and a substantial climb giving great scenic views across the countryside if the day is clear. Upon",
          "I was luckly to arrive there this morning around 10am and the entire crater was visible! This was my first close upview of a crater. What a treat! By the time I was leaving at noon the clouds were starting to cover it up. So make it there in the morning!",
          "Hiking tour of the volcano and surrounding park. A steep hike to reach the top, but the view was great. Continue out to the small lake, very scenic.",
          "The best tip is to get there EARLY!! We got there at 0845 and there was a 10 minute queue to get in. When we left at about midday there was a queue I imagine to be over an hour. It's really all down to luck weather you see anything after your walk to the top. We managed to see",
          "Basically an expensive, but quick way to see a volcano top from a relatively close, but not too close, distance. That's it. Then you return with the masses to your car. There's also another small trail through some slightly stunted trees to a small lake which is also lovely,",
          "Trust us and the guide books: get there at, or not long after, the 8am opening time and you will maximise your chances of seeing the crater. Things looked good when we woke up to blue skies, but the clouds were already starting to gather when we parked up (with \"help\" from the",
          "I am not a good person to review this as we have seen almost too many volcanoes by now. It is a good view to see inside the volcano and the white ash looking lake but the drive up to it is very curvy causing me to get motion sickness. It was very cold up there, take a jacket!!",
          "the entry is a shame, cause it was not possible to go the full way (60min) because they closed the way without any informations. The volcano was not visible because of the fog. the way their with public bus is easy and cheap.",
          "I'm sure this review would be different if we'd gone on a clear day. To be fair, the fellow at the gate warned us before we paid that we probably would not see anything before we paid, but we had driven a distance and had a tight travel schedule, so we tried. It was a fairly",
          "You park the car, walk a few minutes and you're already there. Might be disappointing if you expect/like to walk more. However you actually see the crater pretty well (it was a sunny day when we did it) and it is impressive. But get there early or you may wait a while in your",
          "Truly a positive experience after the walk up to the volcano. The view was just spectacular and visible from the different levels and view points. Fun and enjoyable to see a great natural wonder of nature in person.",
          "We went to the Poas Volcano when we were in the area last month. The most important thing when planning a trip here is to get there early and be sure its not a cloudy day. We planned on taking the public bus up, but were discouraged by the locals because it didn't get there",
          "They say early morning is the best time to be able to see across the crater. The park opens at 8 am and we were there before 9. We did see short glimpses of the central lake and the rims during the hour or so we were there. It's rather expensive to get in and park, but we",
          "The 2/5 is actually for a helpful driver and the views to and from this \"attraction\". I had read about the fog that hid the view and we were there just before 10am, but saw NOTHING. Very disappointing. I can only assume that it is maybe better at other times of the year since",
          "Poas volcano is not too far away from the city of San Jose. I joined the half day tour from Costaricatour.com. The tour guide picked me up on time and its a comfortable and reliable ride. After arrived at the parking, you only need to walk about 600 m to see the first lagoon.",
          "Really cool spot high in the mountains. Clouds swoop in quickly and will obscure your view of the crater, but its still amazing.",
          "The entrance fee was higher than stated on the website and you must pay for parking. The parking was a good hike from the volcano overlook. The elderly and those that have a hard time walking may have a hard time even getting to the overlook. If it is cloudy don't waste your",
          "We've loved what we saw, the main crater, the Laguna Botos and what we've learned about Central Valley volcanoes at the information center. Information was very basic level, but perfect for kids! ADVICES: 1) Don't forget to take a windproof jacket with you (at least) because",
          "Went with a tour group here and enjoyed the 20 minute hike to the crater as well as the additional 15 minute hike to the crater lake,The views of the volcano are absolutely gorgeous and the lake is beautiful,I was lucky to have been there o a day with perfect weather,the gift",
          "Frankly there is so much to see in Cost Rica, I regret we wasted time getting to Volcan Poas. One of the guides admitted that he had been there 25 times and only saw the beautiful crater 3 or 4 times. All we had was a hike in the cloud and rain throughout the drive up there",
          "We made it up to the crater's edge by 10:15 but you could barely make out the lake at that point ... much less the crater details. Let's face it you're in a cloud forest. I think the chances of success are limited unless your a local and give it multiple visits.",
          "It is, understandably, quite a walk up to the viewpoint. We were extremely lucky to have a perfect view from the moment we arrived. Take binoculars and you will be able to see the smoke coming from the crater. Don't rush the walk, which is easy walking, but you are at",
          "We arrived at 8am for the park opening and were about the 8th car in line. Didn't get in until 8.15 - inexplicably, you pay at one kiosk for the people in your party, then you drive forward about 2 metres to a second kiosk to pay separately for your car parking. This caused much",
          "Hike to the volcano is not difficult. Mountain is often shrouded in clouds, and the opportunity to actually see the crater depends on the weather, Very clean and well maintained park.",
          "We toured the volcano with La Paz Waterfall. The crater is a beautiful site and the climb to see the lake is well worth it. The day we visited was sunny, so we got to experience the beauty. BUT, I would caution you as the amount of climbing. The climb is steep especially",
          "After an easy walk to the crafter our first view was of nothing but cloud. Our patience was rewarded as the clouds blew out and we got a stunning view. Some people who arrived, made disappointed comments, and left. Had they only waited a few more minutes... That being said,",
          "It is neat to look into the crater of a volcano if you never have (pretty much looks like an abandoned quarry) ...Thankfully we did not follow the advice on here that says to get there early to avoid cloud cover, because getting there early also means lots of large buses and",
          "I really enjoyed the mild hike up to the crater. Too bad I couldn't see inside because there were too many clouds. It did however make for a surreal experience. It was incredibly cool and damp, very different from down in San Jose. The hike is not too bad. I would recommend this",
          "It is amazing dont miss it, arrive early morning before the tourist groups like 8.00 am, the entrance fee is 15 dollar.",
          "It is a unique experience. Not too strenuous but really great views in a nice area. How often do you get to see a volcano up close? It isn't much but it is worth the trip.",
          "I have seen multiple volcanos and this was far and away the best. We were lucky to have a clear day and the crater was very visable. The viewing areas have been recently rebuilt and are now perfect for viewing. This is a great trip from San Jose or a great stop if coming from",
          "I spent the morning at Poas Volcano as part of an escorted tour. This volcano is very interesting and beautiful with its two craters. The walk to the first crater is fairly easy, but it was quite a climb to view the other, Botes Lagoon. The hike to the lagoon only takes about",
          "This is a very easy , although fairly long, walk on one of the most smooth, groomed paths I have seen. It would be completely accessible by wheelchair, I think. And the viewing area is brand new; lots of concrete, and again, ramps if needed. The view of the crater and some wisps",
          "We arrived at Poas early on a weekend morning and were treated to a wonderful view of one of the world\u2019s largest active craters accented by beautiful clouds. The parking was simple and the walk to the viewing platforms on the rim easy. The nearby Botos Trail will take you to a",
          "You can't always stand on a volcano's crater edge but when you do, it's here. I recommend going as early as possible for a better visibility as clouds tend to cover the view as the day goes by. Take a raincoat just in case and a comfy sweater.",
          "Definitely it's a must! Even though you are unlucky and cannot see the volcano due to the clouds, THE ROAD TO THE TOP IT'S AMAZING!!! Gorgeouuuus you are on the clouds literally, if i would follow the bad comments here, i would have missed such a great place. You don't have to",
          "This was a very interesting place. The walk to the volcano was nice, as well as the walk to the lake. The round trip back to the entrance was blocked/closed, so we returned back the same way. You get a very nice view of the top of the volcano.",
          "I have been to 3 volcanos in Costa Rica and Volcan Poas has hands-down been my favorite! It is a little chilly, since it is so high up, but most volcanos are cold! They just recently created a new viewing deck and it is very well build. The trail from the volcano to the lagoon",
          "We were not overly impressed. The volcano emits some gasses but otherwise is pretty boring. The park is well done and pretty well maintained by the government. Staff are nice and accommodating. We have seen other volcanoes, so that may be why we were underwhelmed.",
          "The visit was amazing. It was a crystal clear day and there was some minor activity at the site with gasses coming out of the crater. One of the best sights I have ever seen. Amazing. Also worth the trip to the old crater which is now a lake. Very beautiful walk. The park",
          "We waited and waited and waited for the clouds to disappear - and they suddenly did! It was so beautiful! Go enjoy it, and remember to take the walk around the crater lakes. The walk in the area, discovering the nature, is worth it all.",
          "Poas volcano is a great place for a quick spot just outside of San Jose. You can hike up the volcano snap a few photo and do a hike and be on the road in an hour.",
          "The coach parked about half a mile from the crater.The uphill walk was gentle to the edge of the view and humming birds and the odd squirrel were to be seen.The visibility was great and steam gently drifted up from the kilometer wide crater.",
          "The weather was perfect. The hike was nice, though if you go to the higher crater that is a little strenuous due to the altitude. Clean, pure beauty!",
          "We went early to try and see the crater before it fogged up but didn't get to see much because it was blowing rain and fog. The souvenir shop was ridiculously over priced. Fun place to go and hike around.",
          "The hike was kind of strenuous but definitely worth it. I'd recommend wearing sneakers and going early in the morning right when they open. We beat the rush and the views were amazing. Definitely worth walking to the crater and to the lake. So peaceful and beautiful.",
          "What a great place on earth. Even though you pay $15 - it is so worth every single penny. The park is clean and well maintained. Your car is being watched for you as well. And that view on the volcano (if your lucky due to the clouds- nature lol) is awesome. There is a nice walk",
          "We had a great time visiting Costa Rica in December with Caravan Tours. One of the first places we visited was Poas Volcano. The bus got us fairly close to the crater, but it is still a bit of a hike at 8,800 feet altitude. Be prepared for wind and rain at any time. I wore my",
          "Fairly easy hike to a beautiful site. The drive is lengthy but worth it. Take a jacket because it will be chilly. Go early. Clouds tend to roll in before noon and obscure the view.",
          "We were very fortunate with our tour group to reach the volcano just when the clouds cleared - what a sight! This is a must see in the area.",
          "To be honest: we did not see the volcano and the lake! But that's nature, you can not expect that you are always lucky. Although we did not see anything, we thought the trip was worth doing, becanse we saw three beautiful sloth on our way to Poas NP. The transportation was fine,",
          "Amazing honestly worth the wait. Will go back for sure every year if possible LOVE IT . We waited for about 2 hours for the sky to clear a little... and after a while we got the best view possible in the whole day. 2:30pm 100% visibility",
          "We were there during hurricane Otto so the weather was not great however there was still a 20 second clearing where we got to see all the way to the bottom. We got to see enough to realize how beautiful it would have been. Also the trail to the lake was closed so that was",
          "The Volcano is a decent hike away from the parking lot, it is by no means an easy hike but isn't that difficult either. Once you reach the actual crater you may be treated to beautiful views, I say may because it gets really foggy really fast and if you blink you might miss it.",
          "Saw a Q about was it worthwhile to visit Volcan Poas - on the way to La Fortuna/Volcan Arenal. My response - absolutely !!! The morning is usually best - but even if cloudy - they have a great visitor's center that explains a lot about Volcanos and the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\"",
          "Beautiful sunny day, yet driving up to Poas proved to be a very different weather - fogged in and rainy. $15 per person at the gate - and you cannot see but 100 ft in front of you...no Poas visible. No crater visible. It would be great if there was some kind of \"Poas viewing\"",
          "I really want to see the Poas volcano... but the day was rainy, like a storm... so it was impossible to see anything! But I imagine in a sunny day, it will be the best place to be! There's a lot of hiking and nature to enjoy. But if the day have any possibility of rain, please,",
          "This was a brilliant trip but we were fortunate to be able to see both the crater and the lake - apparently 85 -90% of people that make this trip don't see either due to the micro climates (according to our guide). The crater is a 800m walk from the car park - easy and pleasant",
          "This is a good location for sight-seeing, and I would say should be on your must-do list when visiting Costa Rica.",
          "It was an easy drive up to Poas from Alajuela. As has been already said on other posts, get here as early as possible in the morning shortly after it opens at 830am to have the best chance of seeing the volcano. I arrived at around 9 during the rainy season and it was pretty",
          "The weather is very very tricky there. you might get there, pay and see absolutely nothing. the lines can be really long and it takes forever. I bet when it is nice water this place might be great but the risk is real",
          "This volcano is an hour or so outside of San Jose; on the way to Arenal Volcano, if you are headed there. The viewpoint is well situated for a view of the caldera, a relatively easy walk from the parking lot and visitor center. There is also a hiking trail. Conventional",
          "Really astounding to see so clearly and nice the volcano creater, and later walk up to another creater full of rain water making a nice lake. The grounds and walk is wonderful with special plants and nice views",
          "You must walk what seems like 0.25 mile up a slight incline to reach viewing platform from the parking lot of park. It became rather cloudy and nothing was viewable as we approached platform. Everyone on platform was rather sad. Waited about 10 minutes and it totally cleared-up",
          "The volcano is beautiful, the facilities are modern, but they are milking the tourists for fees. I have visited Arnal and Manual Antonio parks, but never had to pay for parking fees and hefty park entrance fee! Too many enterprises are capitalizing on this natural beauty!",
          "Well this place look like it could be a nice place to visit but the weather is against you . We check the forecast and it was suppose to be clear . We pay $30.00 USD and $1,500.00 coulomb for parking . Make sure you bring an umbrella and warm clothes . We had to walk uphill all",
          "This is an attraction that depends on the climate. Traveled all the way to see the volcano but could not see 1 thing due to the clouds. very disappointing.",
          "As we found out, this is a cloud rainforest location, so be prepared that you might not see the volcano itself. But, that aside (which for some might be a real downer), we enjoyed the walks on the mountain top in the cloud forest. Please come with warm clothes...it can be",
          "We arrived at Poas Volcano at about 8h30 am, and we weren\u2019t sure if we would see anything because it was a cloudy day and I read all the other reviews about how most people don\u2019t get to see much because the clouds cover everything, and I even wondered if it was worth going at",
          "We loved our visit to the volcano, even though it was cloudy and we didn't get a peek into the crater. We chose to do a couple of the hikes, including the one to the lake, and enjoyed our time there. It rained most of the time we were there, but we had on rain jackets, and were",

          "Was a bit rainy/cloudy, but was still able to see entire crater. First volcano for us. I know there's bigger ones in Costa Rica, but we thought this was enormous! The heights were dizzying. The walk to it from parking lot was about 15 min and of moderate difficulty. The",

          "We visited Volcan Poas in the morning before our flight back home. At 8.00 the entry gate to volcan was open, in 1,5 hours we walked to all viewpoints, read the information around trail, made about 100 pictures of the craters, forest and crater-lake and at 11.50 we had been at",

          "We were over in Costa Rica for a wedding and had a few days to spare so arranged with the family we were staying with to visit the volcano! We were there by 10am to avoid the crowds and we weren't disappointed. We happened to go on a clear day.... even other tour guides were",
          "From all the Volcanoes in Costa Rica I recommend Poas Volcano. Make sure to go on a date that is not raining so you can have the time to enjoy what nature has to offer in the Place. There is no need to booking the Tour prior arriving in Costa Rica, you will find better prices",
          "The short hike up to the overlook area feels a bit strenuous because of the altitude (nearly 9000 feet). The carbuncular crater below one looks a bit like a huge open-cast mine with a milky pool of pus at its center. We saw no sign of volcanic activity. One can then hike a bit",

          "We went to the volcano on a hazy morning. There were breaks in the clouds that allowed us to see the crater, but for the most part, it was too cloudy to be seen. A few meters later, we saw the lake and that was beautiful! There is a lot of walking and not for the asthmatics",

          "It was a long drive to the National Park and sadly the clouds kept us from seeing the crater. Our tour guide explained the vegetation in the cloud forest and we learn about the volcano in the visitors center. The park had lots of parking, restaurants and a nice gift shop as well.",

          "We combined three tours in one: Poas Volcano, Dako Coffee plantation, and some Jungleland/Zoo excursion. The hike up Poas can be strength sapping as it is about 1 mile from parking to the crater viewing area, and the lagoon viewing area is another 1/4 mil. The elevation is what",
          "We drove all the way from the west coast for a couple hours of viewing and it was well worth it. I will say, we got there around 2 PM, and they close at 3 or 330. We got to do the short hike up to the main crater but the lagoon was closed. It was still worth it. The drive up",
          "If you're lucky (as I obviously were), you are bound to experience a wonderful series of events unfold in front of your eyes. A misty vistas, slowly turning out to be tad bit clearer and then eventually you get to see the smoke emanating from the crater and the deep coloured",
          "This was one of the easiest volcanos to visit while my trip in CR. I thought it would not be so amazing. The road to go is fun to drive and with breathtaking views. Once you have parked (paid) and got your ticket (paid again) you start walking the path and after 10 minutes you",
          "You can take a local bus to the volcano. Its a beautiful place to visit, with a lagoon and crater we saw the volcano. its suggested to go early to see the clearest, otherwise in the afternoon the clouds tend to roll in.",
          "A great place to visit. It has amazing views of the Volcano Crater and a Lagoon that on a clear day the views are amazing. My recommendation is to get to the Volcano early in the morning before the clouds and rain. The walk itself is no longer than 4 km all around.",
          "First think people need to know is to wear comfortable shoes because this place is a very long way up. Also you may need to bring a light jacket. As you are walking up to the main center where the souvenir and bathrooms are you can already start to feel a chill in the air. You",
          "The volcano is beautiful in an otherworldly way. We took jackets because it is slightly cool at the top due to the elevation. The park is nice, bathrooms are clean. There are several platforms surrounding the crater to take photos.",
          "What a beautiful sight to see- The Poas Volcano about an 1 1/2 outside of San Jose, Costa Rica. Worth the trip to get outside of the city and to view the countryside of Costa RIca. Along the way you can stop at the fruit stands and get fruit. We bought uchuvas, mamoncillos",
          "We got there just in time. The clouds were rolling in and 5 minutes later the volcano was covered. It was so cool to see something so dramatic just disappear. We were there at 930 and I don't know when/if the clouds cleared after that. The loop around the lake is definitely a",
          "No trip to Costa Rica could be considered complete without a stop to this landmark. One of the best national parks that I have been to.",
          "Nice volcano visit and cool climate,very nice view of crater of lagoon..enjoyed it..but used to cloudy",
          "Had a nice visit to this dormant volcano. The park is quite high in elevation so the temperatures are quite cool. Better to go in the mornings when there are fewer clouds. The hike is quite easy although the altitude, at around 2,700 meters above sea level, can leave you a bit",
          "It's a long ride, and you will pay 15-20 Us per person whether you get to see the volcano or not. Honestly, the place has so much cloud cover, you will see something very cool, or NOTHING at all!",
          "Driving up to the volcano you can see the change in flora and fauna. As you reach the summit and the national park its seemingly doesnt look like much as you enter the parking area where you must back in for safety. Walk out of your vehicle, enter the main building where you",
          "I visited Poas Volcano National Park on a cloudy day could not see the crater of the volcano , anyway the place is very attractive and very well prepared to the public , you can see that they are constantly keeping the place in good condition.",
          "We popped here enroute out of San Jose. It was $15 entry, followed by a gentle uphill stroll to the volcano along tarmac paths. The scenery there was nice and, once the clouds cleared, you got a great view of the volcano. It was a good experience seeing one but after 15minutes",
          "I love this place! nice walk to the volcano, the view is exellent, very nice pictures i personaly recomented",
          "We traveled from Los Suenos from Marriott where it was 88 degrees to 68 degrees to see the volcano. It is breathtaking and very scenic to truly enjoy Mother Nature at its best. We had a tour guide Eco Wonders Travel who was quite informative to share everything you wanted to",
          "We've been to many different volcanos before this one, and were a bit disappointed with Poas. Other places let you inside the volcano to walk on frozen lava. Here you're walking paved paths. So boring! They charge you 15 bucks to enter the park and 10 for parking your car but",
          "Great walk to the craters and a cool walk through the cloud forest. Exhibition center was informative on volcanos",
          "The trails in Parque Nacional Volcan Poas are very nice. They are mostly either paved or laid with brick and are surrounded by some great cloud forest scenery. They can get a bit steep at times but the walk to the lookouts is easy and short (less than 1 km if I remember",
          "If you are lucky enough and the weather is kind to you, then you can see an amazing crater. It is better if you come as early as possible because clouds tend to appear in the afternoon.",
          "Pouring rain when we went, but we waited a few and just enough clearing came through for us to see this magnificent sight. Bring rain gear and dress warm, about 50 degrees F, especially when raining and wet - but marvelous sight if you get to see it. Coffee and snacks",
          "I have seen a few volcanos in my life but this was the closest to the crater I have been. When we arrived, there was 100% cloud cover. Nothing to see. I read numerous reviews on Tripadvisor and the common message was \"be patient, wait 20 minutes\". We waited 35 minutes and",
          "The guides ate the entrance to the park warned us that several trails were closed and that the volcano crater was covered in cloud. We decided to walk up anyway. The walk is wheelchair friendly, everyone friendly and the volcano breathtaking. The cloud cleared and there we were",
          "So i took my friends to the volcano so they can check the only volcano in the world thats flat....first they charge 10 times more if you are a tourist and when we got to the top was cloudy cant see anything. Also the access to the lake was not open for tourist. Such a waste of",
          "I have never seen a volcano before, and to go up and view it from the crater was just amazing. We even got lucky enough to witness a tiny eruption, If the clouds are covering it, just wait a few minutes, they move.. This place is gorgeous and a MUST see! Once in a life time",
          "The volcano was breathtaking, it was cloudy so we had to wait for the clouds to clear out. We were not able to see the lake as it was under construction at the time. It was $15 each to get and $3 for parking.",
          "All my life I want to see real volcano. Thank you, Costa Rica, my dream comes true. It's been great adventure.",
          "After telling local people that I had seen the crater at Poas, they told me how lucky I had been. It seems some locals have gone there many times but were unable to see the crater because of the mist and clouds. It is an impressive sight and worth visiting. It is a short walk",
          "This is an easy walking trip from the entrance to the national park - because you are already at a relatively high altitude (over 2,000 m). If you're a serious vulcanologist with scientific credentials you can get down the crater and close to the sulphurous lagoon by",
          "If you ate looking to get the best out of Costa Rica, this is a place to visit. My family and I went to the volcano last year and experienced a nice view, saw unique volcano type vegetation and relaxed while breathing fresh nature air.",
          "Go in the morning for the clearest view of this volcano! It is definitely worth the drive and the hike into the park to see this attraction!",
          "This was one of our stops with Caravan Tours. There is an onsite cafeteria, gift shop, small museum and restrooms. It's a small hike to the volcano on uneven ground but very doable. You do climb to about 8,871 feet so keep in mind if you have difficulty breathing as you also",
          "We visited Volcan Poas on the way to our first main destination on the Pacific Coast. When we drove up the the guard window to purchase tickets, we were told it had been cloudy all day and almost didn't go in. I decided it was worth the cost to have a chance to see the crater,",
          "A good place to visit, nice views see the wildlife it's an active crater so you might see it smoking. Well worth a visit.",
          "The weather is cool so bring a light jacket. Breathtaking view! This is one of several active volcanoes in Costa Rica. There is a small visitor center but well prepared with information regarding the Costa Rican volcanoes. On your way you can enjoy fresh strawberries and",
          "Amazing to see the caldera but then not much afterwards. Basically all trails closed at this time. Spent more time in the gift shop then in the park. Will likely improve a lot when other trails open.",
          "Nice easy excursion for families. Watch the weather to make sure you go when the clouds have cleared...early morning is best.",
          "Poas is an active volcano an hour away from San Jose. We wtook the guided tour and reached the volcano around 12 noon. The crater was completely covered by clouds. The tour operators do not tell you that before you buy the tickets. You need to get there early morning to get a",
          "The Paos Volcano was cloudy and rainy on the day we went and so did not get a clear view but we still enjoyed it.",
          "We decided to risk it even though it was really cloudy all the way up the drive to the POAS volcano and it was even raining a lot on the way up, but it is a very pretty drive and you can see waterfalls across the valley as you drive and even pass one on the way up. Make sure to",
          "We were so fortunate to have hired a driver from our San Jose hotel who took us around for the day. As July is known to be the wet season, particularly in a cloud forest, we absolutely lucked out when the fog and mist surrounding the top of the crater lifted for a half hour and",
          "We visited Poas a day in july and shortly after leaving Poas had a minor eruption from the crater. Isn't that exciting (when not there)! Very nice vulcano to visit as the volcano is active but of the calmer and more harmless type. A nice road with a number of amazing viewing",
          "My husband and were excited to view Poas and were warned that we may not see the volcano due to the cloud cover. We walked the trail to the volcano and the warnings were spot on, we couldn't see anything. We hiked around a little more and then came back about 30 minutes later",
          "I was lucky in that the day we came it was clear l, as I understand from locals that it often rains and the clouds can hide the sight of the volcano. It was pretty chilly compared to San Jose but was a pleasant uphill walk up to the volcano. The view reminded me of a disused",
          "Thanks to tripadvisor for the tip to go early (before 9:30am) if you want to see the crater. The drive going to the volcano is amazing. The view is so lush and green. Its a winding road but people drive slow so it was fine. The entrance fee for non residents is $15 plus you have",
          "If you can imagine something stark and lush this is the place. The clouds surround you. From one moment to the next you can go from fog to shine(literally). The peak you look down into the crater of milky water. This covers the vent of the volcano. surrounding the crater is a",
          "Visited the volcano in july. We were lucky as we got to see it pretty clearly. When you can see it, it is marvellous. However it does get very crowded.",
          "Even though it was incredibly cloudy the day we visited, we still had a great time. The walk up to the volcano was pretty but all we could see when we go to the rim was clouds. However, we did smell the sulfur so we knew we were at a volcano. I can only imagine how beautiful i",
          "This was my first tourist outing innCosta Rica, after having lived there for more than a month. The drive from San Jose to Po\u00e1s is pretty smooth. We left at 8am and got there in just over about an hour and 20 minutes. The volcano is quite the site, but the wind move the clouds",
          "So much to say bout the whole trip really, but to start, the drive up the mountain is unreal!..so many amazing views, as far as the eye can see, then you're above the clouds. So bring a sweater if you easily get chilly cause it's probably a 15degreeC drop in temp once you walk",
          "This is really going to be amazing or a let down depending on the weather. What is nice is the fact that the person selling the tickets was really up front about the fact you probably couldn't see anything. I went anyway and still appreciated the hike and being able to smell the",
          "Go early, go early, go early. Weather is indeed an issue so early is your best shot. We hired a private driver, Alberto Artavia. alberto1175@gmail.com tel:50688617209 Facebook: colochostours and he was terrific. He took my husband, myself and my 90 year old mom up the volcano",
          "I learned something about Poas that I will pass on. The weather is a HUGE factor in getting to see the crater. Had I known this I would certainly not made the drive up the the mountain. Basically I drove two hours to get to the top. Once there I paid $15 dollars entry fee and",
          "Beautiful drive up to the volcano. Lovely scenic views along the way and there are some places you can stop for a picnic lunch. Upon arrival, you will have to pay an entry fee per person and parking. Once you park it's a little bit of a walk to the volcano. Absolutely worth it.",
          "The volcano was beautiful. This was certainly a check off of the bucket list. The weather was perfect, so the crater was fully visible. The hike up to the lookout point was not at all difficult. The path was paved, and there was plenty of room for all visitors to pass. They will",
          "Easy to get up to the volcano but the weather is a hot and miss. If it is cloudy you wont see much. Hiking to the caldera is very easy just a few hundred yards. Make sure you have some rain gear regardless how weather looks in San Jose. Best is to go early in the morning , have",
          "The national park is wonderful. Bring a light jacket as temps drop going up to it. Beautiful views and a great nature trail to walk on the way down to the visitor center.",
          "Went there on a recent trip to Costa Rica. It is the most popular volcano in the area for tourists, with good reason. A great, if snakelike, drive to get there. The place is under construction so over 2/3 of the trails are closed. They tell you that up front. Don't let it",
          "Hiking trails were closed due to renovation, as well as most of the volcano's viewing area. The volcano's crater was no visible, but that is something that human beings have no control over. Still impressive. However, renovating one trail at a time would have allowed visitors,",
          "We walked up to the summit of the volcano--not a bad hike--lots of pretty flowers and plants and some birds to see along the way. We were only allowed to stay for 20 minutes due to gases being emitted by the volcano. It is a worthwhile sight!",
          "We took a private tour including driving to this place (pricey but it is better and it IS vacations after all) Our guide (Anthony Arce) was really great!!! He explained everything from the flora and fauna of the place and we were bird sighting, he warned us the volcano isn`t",
          "This is a hit or miss event, they say the crater is visible about 30% of the time, it was total cloud cover the time we were there so we just looked into an abyss of fog. However, its interesting to see the cloud forest and plants that grow there, so other things to do as well",
          "We took a combination tour of Poas and the La Paz waterfall tour. We had a clear morning and got to Poas about 10 am. We contracted at our hotel, the total got 2 people was $260. We were gone about 6 hours. The volcano could be seen, but there was a layer of (clouds ?). So we",

          "When we visited, there was only one trail open, the one to the crater. It was cloudy and misty. NOTHING was visible at all. I'm sure that under better weather conditions it is noteworthy. However, this is my review. What a waste of money!",
          "The Poas volcano has a beautiful view and nice man-made trails to walk around the native vegetation - you might even get to see some animals. It is a long(ish) drive for a very short walk, but it is worth it.",
          "I visited this place with the help of a guide. We arrived at the vista point around 9:00 am. Even though the drive up to the volcano we had clear sky, once we reached the volcano it was fogged in. We had to wait about 45 min for the clouds to dissipate and allow us to the crater",
          "The drive up the very hilly and picture perfect road was thrilling. Even though we had no access to the adjunct lake , due to construction work currently going on, it was worth the visit to see an active crater. The uphill drive was a beauty .... what with the view of the",
          "This is one of the several active volcanoes in Costa Rica, one that you can get to easily from San Jos\u00e9, and experience its majestic power and visuals. Fume clouds, an active crater, a wonderful trail to the top, and the exquisite flora of the region make this an essential trip",
          "It was pouring rain when we went, but that didn't stop us. After a few minutes, it let up and the clouds cleared, revealing the crater. If at first it's cloud covered, be patient.",

          "We were lucky to have a clear day and to get great views of the crater. Unfortunately the majority of the trails were closed for renovation, so we did not get to see as much of the park as we would have liked. The little museum was interesting and the gift shop was varied and",
          "When we went the picnic area and trails were closed for renovation. We did get to see the volcano though. However, to justify the admission & parking fees all the areas need to be available if you are a wildlife fan.",
          "I have gone to the volcano and seen absolutely nothing. Many times. But, I have seen in on a clear day twice, and it is spectacular. Nice bathrooms. Nice trail. Nice little shop for snacks. There is a souvenir shops, but it is more expensive than in the city.",
          "It is worth going on a guided tour to benefit from the details of the flora and fauna on the way up. The view of the volcano was fantastic.",
          "We were really lucky to see the volcano. We arrived at 8am when the park had just opened and had to pay $15 per person for entrance and $3 for parking. Only the trail to the volcano itself was open due to maintenance work. We got there in time to see the volcano in its full",
          "I was fortunate to be able to visit the volcano on a very clear morning. I really enjoyed the experience and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the other hiking trails are closed. Only the main trail was open while I was in town. I thought it was",
          "I am sure that the Volcano is stunningly beautiful and absolutely worth a visit but we were there on a cloudy day so could not see a thing. We knew this before and decided to go anyway to walk the trails and hope that the sky would clear up. The problem is that we paid 15 USD",
          "We were very lucky to have a clear view into the crater! The views were amazing! We also hiked the trails - saw wonderful views and wildlife. The bathrooms are clean and the gift shop had lots of good souvenirs. The food shop didn't have a lot of variety, but the workers for",
          "Unfortunately we visited the park on a cloudy, over cast day, and saw nothing other than the hoards of people on the trail walking to the top to view the crater and its lake, which was not visable! The smell of the sulfur and the high altitude made some of the older members",
          "This is a refreshing, cool change from San Jose. There are nice walking trails, and good photo opportunities. Mostly I appreciated the fresh air and being able to stretch my legs at altitude. The views are spectacular if you happen to catch it on a good weather day - the weather",
          "The nature trail to the top of the volcano is a good display of various flora of a cloud forest. On a good day, you can see the main crater of the volcano, if you are patient and wait for the cloud cover to dissipate.",
          "Sadly, I couldn't see anything. It was too fogy. I've heard that it is beautiful, but I can't tell. Moreover the trekking trails were close. Therefore, I just went to the volcano side (see nothing) and the left the place.",
          "I toured this park as part of a guided tour that included a visit to a historical woodwork shop that makes the traditional ox carts. It was a beautiful day weather wise and so I walked to two walled viewing point that are about a kilometer from the small acid crater. It's a",

          "I had read that the earlier one could get up to the crater, the better. However, upon talking to locals it was made clear that albeit the morning is often the best time to catch a good glimpse of the steaming/smoking crater, the weather up there at that altitude can change",
          "Go early or cloud cover will cause zero-volcano-viewing. Worth going to see! Easy inclined walk up to viewing area. We saw the crater only as the lagoon location was closed off but crater was an awesome sight with smoke/steam wafting up. We paid to get into the national park",

          "Check at the gate before you pay to make sure the crater isn't covered in cloud. If it is you won't see anything. I got there early and watched the clouds rolling in. Unless you are seriously into volcanos, this is one to miss if you don't have time and can't get there",
          "Nice place to visit. We had spectacular weather. Too many clouds for us to see the volcano, but still worth the effort.",
          "We were told that very few people like this place because after the mild walk, the clouds or fog covers most of the area and viewing is very limited. We got lucky. Great weather, we beat the crowds, and the view was fantastic. Park entry was at the time,$10 a person and a $3",

          "Beautiful place, but get there EARLY. I mean 8am when they open, 9 at the latest to have the best chance to see the crater. Also very important, definitely be early if your going on a weekend or holiday. 8:30 at the latest. I have seen 3 to 5 kms of cars lined back to back",

          "Magnificent view. Only one trail is open the other one was closed for some work at the time we visited (Apr 2016). Be prepared to pay separately for entry to the park and for the car parking though.",
          "the trail to the volcano is very short and easy. take motion sickness medicine if you need it for the drive up. Beautiful over looks.",
          "Awesome view, very clear and you could also see the Atlantic side and the Pacific side of Costa Rica. We were there at 10 am and we visit Poas the 1st week of March. The trial to the volcano view is short 30 minutes walk and my mom of 75 enjoyed it.",
          "We were quite lucky on the day we visited, right after Easter - no lines to get into the park, ample parking, got there at around 11 am. The view of the volcano was clear, a few clouds hung around the volcano but kept their distance. We took the long trail back to the parking",
          "Went to Poas on a cloudy day so we didn't get to see the crater. We did get to view the lake and walk the trail. Very enjoyable. Some may consider the trail strenuous.",
          "Very nice place to visit and good price. We had a driver take us so we were able to enjoy the drive and not have to find it ourselves. This is a place you need to visit early in the morning before the clouds move in. We were lucky and it was a clear day and around 9 am. We",
          "It's not every day you get to stand in a volcano crater! I led a student travel group here on our first day in Costa Rica. The view is spectacular and the air quality is not too bad. They do recommend you only stay in the area for a certain amount of time.",
          "Meh, it\u2019s okay. During Easter weekend, the line of cars snaking along the narrow roads were interminable. More stopping than going, we finally made it to the entrance, though we saw dozens of cars turning around heading back to San Jos\u00e9. I wish we had been in one of them. We had",
          "So worth it. It is beautiful and a must see. It is foggy most of the time but our guide stated that it clears for a few minutes. So you may have to wait for a while so it clears up. But that wait and even the whole trip is worth it if you get to see it.",
          "We drove up to the Volcano it was a beautiful drive up, since we are not locals we had to pay the non local fee...not a problem worth it. We went on a cloudy day, so it was hard to see the volcano, but we enjoyed and walked all the trails, what a hike, bring water and a camera,",
          "We took the public bus to visit Poas Volcano and we were looking forward to doing some of the trails. However when we got there we found out all the trails were closed except the road that went to the view point. As we were on the public bus we could not turn back or avoid",
          "Really interesting, and we had a clear day ! The long hike around the lake was strenuous at altitude, but a fine walk rewarded with bird sightings, and jungle like foliage.",
          "The volcano view was great however, 2 out of 3 trails were closed when we visited, but still had to pay the full price. 15$US for a 10-minute walk to the volcano is expensive! You do have to arrive early thougg as you won't be able to see the volcano because of the clouds so",
          "We stayed in Alajuela the night before and it was a short drive to the volcano. we were there by about 9:00 a.m. and the clouds had not started to roll in. It was a Saturday morning and there were tons of people already. The parking lot was almost full. The volcano was",
          "We were lucky: there were no lines to the parking, and there were no clouds over the crater, so the whole experience was seamless and enjoyable. However the trail to lagoon is not available, they are doing some sort of renovation, so $15 per person for seeing just a crater was a",
          "Our family left early on a sunny day for an hour and a half drive up and down the switchbacks around the park. Unfortunately when we reached the top there was a mass of clouds and the attendant at the gate told us we would not be able to see into the volcano at this time. For",
          "We were staying overnight in Poasito, so we decided to go first thing in the morning, at 8:00 figuring we would finally see the crater. There was no line at that time, we were paying for the parking, and were told there was only one trail open. We had hoped to do some hiking",
          "A short hike will lead you to the top of the crater. Beautiful view of the volcano- come early!! The fog rolls in mid to late morning and then you see nothing. The day we went all of the other trails were closed for maintenance yet they still charged full price- $30 + parking.",
          "After waiting in a car line for about an hour to get into the park due to lack of parking, the volcano was covered in clouds. We were told by another local that the volcano is usually visible before 9am, but the park doesn't open until 11am.....also, the park is very small,",
          "The colors and crater are beautiful. The hike up is paved and very accessible to just about anyone. Our small children had no problem.",
          "Wonderful hike to see the volcano (clouds permitting) and trails to the lagoon. Its in a cloud forest so expect to get wet or at least a bit damp.",
          "It\u2019s a long ride to the Park if you are staying in San Jose, and I understand it\u2019s frequently cloudy at the crater. We were fortunate that the sky was clear and thus had beautiful views. It\u2019s a nice hike, maybe a little strenuous, up to the volcano crater. I strongly recommend",
          "We went two days in a row, but still weren't able to see the caldera. The side hike to Lago Botos was beautiful! We rented a car, and every warning we heard about driving in Costa Rica was true! Twisty mountain road, homes right up to the road, people and dogs standing in the",
          "We went to Poas Volcano as part of a package tour, and it was worth the trip. The walk from the nicely-done visitors' center to the volcano is only slightly uphill and takes about 15 minutes. The view, on a clear day, is spectacular. We took the lower path down instead of going",
          "Poas Volcano is the most visited national park in Costa Rica, and it sure is a nice place to visit. We were not lucky enough to view the big crater during our 2-hour stay in the park - there were thick clouds stationed there the whole time. But we hiked the Sendero Botos trail",
          "it is a very touristy place. the walk to the lagoon is worth it in case the clouds move out and you can see the actual lagoon. it is super beautiful.",
          "We loved our tour by Anywhere Costa Rica, they stopped at the Doka Estate Coffee farm and we loved having a nice view and coffee, then on to the National Park for a tour, an individual hike, time to see the visitors center, and shuttled back to our base in Alejuela. 1st rate,",
          "This park is well maintained, access to the volcano rim is very easy, even for those in wheelchairs or using canes. We, unfortunately, got there later than we hoped. Go early...8-9am, for the best views.",
          "This is a must see and a great place for photos. Kids and adults both enjoy it. It's very accessible and a great way to start a tour of this beautiful country.",
          "We arrived at opening time (8am). Self drive. There were no tour buses at this stage. As we left a couple hours later there were about twenty buses and a full car park. It was chilly. Bring an extra layer. We had perfect clear weather. Could fully see the mouth of the",
          "We were super lucky in that there wasn't much fog when we were there so we were able to see both the crater and the lagoon. It is also really easy to get there from Alajuela since there's a bus you can take straight there. Our bus driver also stopped at a cute street side store",
          "Our first full day in Costa Rico we drove up to Poas. Driving in Costa Rico is, of course, an adventure in itself, but we were quite happy to have our own SUV and be on our own schedule. The drive to Poas is quite beautiful. Visitors can pay in dollars or colones (credit cards,"

          "We drove all the way for 1.5 hours and we couldn\u2019t see the crater at all, it was all cloudy . Though it\u2019s understandable that weather is unpredictable, it should have been mentioned while booking the tickets about the visibility or while entering the park",
          "It's a bit of a money grab, but also an incredible sight. Here's how it works:\n\nYou need to buy a ticket for a specific timeslot in advance. You can do it online at sinac.go.cr for $15 (foreigners, ticos pay less) or from a shop in the area \u2026",

          "Beautiful but so disappointing that you cannot pay at the park entrance. All tickets must be purchased online and they will not allow you to pay upon arrival. Apparently some shops sell tickets too but it just is an inconvenience as many cars approached the entrance and then had to turn around, pull off and purchase tickets online.",
          "always love going here. Specially when it is clear and you can see the crater open wide.",
          "You need to book your entry tickets in advance! And pick an early entry time before the clouds and mist rolls in.  But no matter the weather, it is a lovely adventure.   And buy strawberries when you go back down the mountain.  You won't regret it.",
          "A very popular park and for good reasons!!  The drive up is very nice with many little farms and forest. The walk to the crater is short and the view is very impressive. Many hiking trains in small stunted forest. You can see many birds, \u2026",
          "Beautiful landscapes of this amazing crater. Make sure to check out if it's open since the volcanoe has been quite active in the recent years. Nice hikes, makes sure to bring along your hiking shoes and rain jacket. Beautiful touristic restaurants and lodges around the park. Beautiful!",

Have some patience, and you will get some great views. The walk up is very easy (and even wheel chair friendly) and takes about 15-20 minutes.  Entrance is $10 for tourists.",
          "One of my favorite national parks, green and with a great path to capture photos. The crater might not always be visible but if you are lucky enough you will be amazed. It takes 2h to go through all trails.",

          "Really, really amazing place, BUT you need to carefully plan your trip to this Volcano. Check the weather forecast in this area, if there are too many clouds skip it and move your trip for some other day. If you are in the rainy season there are really few days when you can see the full beauty of this place.",

If you don't want people inquiring simply don't post a phone number of just update your information on your Web pages.",

          "The new rate for non-nationals is 15$. Take your time to quietly walk through the forest path and you will be rewarded with many creatures to see.  If you stomp through in flip flops while yelling at your friends or family you will not see as many amazing things.  ",
          "Was a beautiful walk to the volcano and we were lucky that the clouds lifted enough for us to see all.   ",
          "Very recommended! Get up early if you want to see the crater otherwise it would be cloudy. ",
          "We witnessed an eruption in our 20 minutes over there.",
          "What a sight! Worth getting there before 10am to see the crater before the clouds rolled in. It was a delight to walk the maintained path to Botos Lagoon.",
          "Was there tofa 5/2/ 2016.  Spectacular and challenging drive up to the park.  Fee is now $15 for non residents of Costa Rica.  Parking is not included and is $5.  Two of the foot paths are under construction an are not accessable.  This is a must see.",
          "Long ride to top. View into Volcano is great. Not much else there and the ride is through some pretty poor areas with lots of traffic. ",
          "Access to the volcano is well kept. The area to see the crater is very small and there is not enough space for the number of visitors.",

          "Lovely place but beware the clouds! We couldn't see anything of the crater",
          "The best time to see the volcano and to enter to the park is been there up to 8am",
          "Beautiful, rain or shine, clouds or not, though I recommend a clear day, meaning it either needs to be dry season or early in the morning. Also, if you're interested in hiking, you can walk up from Bosque del ni\u00f1o, which is even more beautiful. ",
          "Pretty cool view of the crater, although heavily dependent on the weather as it can quickly become obscured by clouds. Didn't see much else in the park so can't comment on anything else.",

          "Great view of the inside of the volcano. It is also a beautiful drive up there with many views of the entire Central Valley.",
          "Its really nice place but too expensive for just one lookout and one loop. If you stop in any other volcano dont wast your time and money to stop here as well.",

        "wiki": "Hacienda Luisita is a 6,453-hectare sugar plantation located in the province of Tarlac, Philippines. The hacienda spans 11 barangays in three towns of Tarlac province. Most of the original farmworkers reside in 10 villages \u2013 Barangays Balete, Cutcut (or Sta. Catalina), Lourdes (formerly Texas), Mapalacsiao (formerly Luisita), Asturias, and Bantog in Tarlac City; Barangay Motrico in La Paz town; and Barangays Parang (formerly San Sebastian), Mabilog (formerly Pasajes) and Pando in Concepcion town. The original estate includes the Central Azucarera de Tarlac (CAT) sugar mill and a golf course. The eleventh village is Barangay Central in Tarlac City which houses the CAT sugar mill, the St. Martin de Porres Hospital and the Our Lady of Lourdes Church. It features Luisita Golf and Country Club, a golf course and Las Haciendas de Luisita Subdivision, a 5-interconnected luxury subdivision.Originally owned by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda General de Tabacos de Filipinas, it is now owned by the Cojuangco family who acquired the hacienda in the late 1950s. The estate's incorporators, who control 70 percent of Hacienda Luisita's stock shares, are Pedro Cojuangco, Josephine C. Reyes's heirs, Teresita C. Lopa's heirs, Jos\u00e9 Cojuangco, Jr., and Mar\u00eda Paz C. Teopaco, all siblings of the late former President Coraz\u00f3n C. Aquino who, on the day she became President of the Philippines, bequeathed her shares to her children and the Daughters of Charity and other non-profit organizations. The remaining 30 percent of the stock shares was given to farm workers under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program's stock distribution option scheme.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Spanish era ===\n\nHacienda Luisita was once part of the holdings of Compa\u00f1\u00eda General de Tabacos de Filipinas, Sociedad An\u00f3nima, better known as Tabacalera. The land was owned by Spain, by virtue of the country's colonial relationship to the Philippines. The tobacco company was founded on 26 November 1881 by the Spaniard Antonio L\u00f3pez y L\u00f3pez from Comillas, Cantabria and Santiago de Cuba, and Don Guillermo Rubio born in Santander, Cantabria.In 1780, the popularity of cigars in the Philippines prompted Spanish authorities to impose a tobacco monopoly, such that the only ones able to plant, manufacture, and sell cigars were the colonial government. Tabacalera was a private enterprise Lopez y Lopez founded with the sole intention of taking over the Philippine Tobacco Monopoly from the Spanish colonial government; the monopoly was abolished a year after Lopez y Lopez acquired the estate. This included the Hacienda Antonio (named after his eldest son), Hacienda San Fernando and Hacienda Isabel (named after his eldest daughter) in Cagay\u00e1n and Isabela provinces where the La Flor de Isabela cigar was cultivated. Due to the high profits of sugar and tobacco in the Philippines, Antonio L\u00f3pez y L\u00f3pez and his son, Claudio L\u00f3pez Bru, the second to hold the title, donated some of the profits to the Jesuits to create the Pontifical University of Comillas, a university outside Madrid.\n\n\n=== American period ===\n\nDuring the American period, the hacienda supplied almost 20% of America's sugar from 1898 to the 1940s (from the Spanish\u2013American War until World War II) back when the Tabacalera still owned it. Because of this, the Luisita sugar became popular locally as well. The Spanish-owned hacienda flourished mainly because of America's obsession with sugar. In the 1920s, Tabacalera then left the tobacco business to focus on the growing sugar industry to cater to US\u2019 needs since this product was more profitable at the time. They invested heavily on the business by constructing a sugar refinery known as \"Central Azcurarera de Tarlac\" (CAT) which used America's centrifugal machinery technology in order to double the production and lessen the cost of shipping sugar to a refinery in Laguna owned by the Roxas Family.The refinery became the largest sugar central in the Philippines thus increasing Tabacalera's profits. With a new production line, the refinery required a new system for more efficiency. Workers were laid off or forced to retire since old farm workers were not familiar with the new technology. This then resulted to continuous protests for a year. The Hacienda produced 126,129 tons of sugar in 1928 as well as allegedly receiving additional tons of sugar with current prices of Php 23,450. The workers then found out that the hacienda was receiving multiple fines that were deducted from the workers\u2019 wages, which sparked outrage.\n\n\n=== Japanese occupation of the Philippines ===\nDuring the Japanese period, the Hacienda still continued all operations in sugar production. A Japanese policy was put in place to ensure that supplies in commodities such as rice and sugar were not interrupted and were made available to Filipinos in order to avoid insurgencies or rebellions. The continuation of the production both served the Japanese and the Spanish's interests at that time.In 1942, Luis Taruc and 200 members formed HUKBALAHAP, a peasant based guerrilla army to fight the Japanese forces. Many of these members were farmers of Hacienda Luisita because of their discontent with Tabacalera, advocating for the distribution of land. On 25 January 1945, General Douglas Macarthur set up his headquarters at Hacienda Luisista to fight Japanese forces in the Philippines.\nIn 1947, a farmer's wife was reported to be raped by one of the remaining Spanish directors of the hacienda. In support of her, other wives lay themselves on the railroad tracks to stop the trains carrying sugar from being delivered. The Spanish director immediately left for Spain which pushed the Huks to execute Spanish \"encargados\" or managers in front of the guest house when they refused to admit to the crime.\n\n\n=== Jos\u00e9 Cojuangco period (1957-1976) ===\n\nIn 1957, the owners of the Tabacalera decided to sell Hacienda Luisita as well as the sugar mill, Central Azcurarera de Tarlac (CAT), because of the HUKBALAHAP rebels who were causing them problems. The CAT was supposed to be sold to the Lopez family of Iloilo but then the purchase was vetoed by President Ramon Magsaysay due to the clan owning multiple businesses such as Meralco, ABS-CBN, the Manila Chronicle, Negros Navigation, as well as a number of substantial agricultural holdings, which the president deemed to problematic because the Lopez's were becoming too powerful. \nPresident Magsaysay then offered the Central Azcurarera de Tarlac to Jose Cojuangco Sr. through Ninoy Aquino Jr (Jose's son-in-law) in early 1957. Ninoy Aquino was Magsaysay's political prodigy and personal assistant at that time, which helped the Cojuangcos in purchasing the CAT. As agreed upon, the hacienda would be paid for in pesos, while the CAT would be paid for in US dollars. The Philippine government aided the Cojuangcos in obtaining the loans needed to pay the price.In 1957, the clan took control of the CAT and the hacienda through Manufacturer's Trust Co New York. endorsed by the Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) as well as Government System Insurance Service (GSIS). The BSP then approved the loan on August 1957 under two conditions, one of which states that the CAT be bought together with Hacienda Luisita and that the hacienda shall be distributed to farmers under the Magsaysay's social justice program. The government then authorized a P 5.9 million loan from GSIS which was approved on November 1957. The Cojuangcos were given a ten-year window to distribute the lands to farmers as stipulated. Finally on 1958, Jose Cojuangco Sr.\u2019s Tarlac Development Corporation (TADECO) became the new owner of Hacienda Luisita as well as the CAT. Ninoy Aquino then became Luisita\u2019s first administrator.\n\n\n=== Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos (1965-1986) ===\nThe year 1967 marked the end of the 10-year window given to the Cojuangcos that the Philippine government gave in order to distribute the land. However, the Cojuangcos failed to distribute any land. In response, farmers\u2019 organizations began to form in order to push for the distribution.This was combined with political unrest in the nation. The United Luisita Workers Union (ULWU) was created because of this. This year was also when Benigno Aquino Jr. was elected senator.Nationwide Martial Law was declared on 21 September 1972, and Benigno Aquino Jr., the son-in-law of Jose \"Pepe\" Cojuangco, was among the first to be imprisoned for treason, murder, subversion and weapons possession. During this time, the Marcos administration took an interest in enforcing land reform.Jose Cojuangco died on 21 August 1976, five years from the day of the Plaza Miranda bombing. On 7 May 1980, the government filed a case against Tarlac Development Corporation, or TADECO (a Cojuangco company) before the Manila Regional Trial Court (RTC). The case (Republic of the Philippines vs. TADECO, Civil Case No. 131654, Manila Regional Trial Court, Branch XLIII) sought the surrender of the hacienda to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform in order to properly distribute the land to the qualified farm workers. The Cojuangcos responded to the case saying that there were no such tenants or farm workers qualified to receive such land. This was during the same time that Ninoy Aquino and his family were to leave for exile in the United States. At the time, the anti-Marcos block portrayed this lawsuit as an attack on the Aquino family by the Marcoses, while the farmers viewed it as the government taking action to help them.Ninoy Aquino was shot on 21 August 1983, as he was descending the plane. On 2 December 1985, the Manila RTC ordered TADECO to surrender Hacienda Luisita to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR, now the Department of Agrarian Reform, or DAR) due to noncompliance of the land reform act. TADECO alleged that the hacienda housed no tenants, and that the hacienda's sugar lands are not covered by existing agrarian reform legislations. The Cojuangcos brought the case to the Court of Appeals due to their belief that the case was an act of harassment by the Marcos administration because Corazon Aquino took her late husband's place to run against Marcos in the 1986 snap elections. Of note is that land reform was one of the issues her campaign focused on. The snap elections were fraught with anti-Marcos allegations, and led to the People Power Revolution.\n\n\n=== Presidency of Coraz\u00f3n \u201cCory\u201d C. Aquino (1986-1992) ===\nDespite the installation of Corazon Aquino as president, the farmland was not being distributed. Thousands of farmers marched to Malaca\u00f1ang Palace on 22 January 1987. 13 protesting farmers were shot in what is now known as the \"Mendiola Massacre.\" On 22 July 1987, Aquino issues Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order No. 229, which outlines her agrarian reform program. In 18 May 1988, the case the Marcos administration filed against TADECO was dismissed by the Court of Appeals, and the Philippine government, under the Aquino administration, moved to dismiss its own case. In 10 June 1988, the Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law) is signed into law by President Aquino. The law includes a Stock Distribution Option (SDO) which would allow landowners to distribute the stock shares of the land to the farmers, instead of actual land.In compliance with the CARP, 4915.75 hectares of Hacienda Luisita were folded into Hacienda Luisita Inc. (HLI) on 23 August 1988, in order to comply with a stock distribution agreement between the landowners and farm workers. The hacienda's farmers voted 92.9% in favor of the SDO route with regards to the land reform act. This agreement was implemented on 11 May 1989. The farm workers' therefore now owned 33% of the plantation, while the Cojuangcos retained ownership of the remaining 67% of stocks. In accordance with the SDO agreement, there would be a 30-year schedule for distributing and transferring the stocks to the farmers.\n\n\n=== Present period (1992-onwards) ===\nIn 1 September 1995, 3,290 hectares of the hacienda was reclassified from agricultural to commercial, industrial, and residential land. This was passed by the Provincial Board of Tarlac, the governor of which was Margarita \"Tingting\" Cojuangco, wife of Jose \u201cPeping\" Cojuangco, Jr., brother of Cory Aquino. The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) approved the conversion of 500 hectares in 1996.In 2003, hacienda workers filed a petition to have the SDO agreement revoked, and in 2005, the DAR cancelled the stock distribution agreement. It was cited that the SDO had failed to improve the lives of the more than 5,000 farmer beneficiaries. HLI appealed this decision, but in May 2006, the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council rejected with finality the motion of HLI to reconsider the revocation of the stock distribution agreement. However, the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order, stopping the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council from parceling out the land to the workers.\n\n\n== Criticisms of ownership ==\nThe Cojuangcos have often garnered criticism for their ownership of the estate with some critics comparing the situation to problems seen in oligarchy based systems. The estate's incorporators, who control 70 percent of the stock shares of the Hacienda, are Pedro Cojuangco, the children of Josephine C. Reyes, the heirs of Teresita C. Lopa, Jos\u00e9 Cojuangco, Jr., and Mar\u00eda Paz C. Teopaco\u2014all of whom were siblings of the late former President Coraz\u00f3n C. Aquino who, on the day she became President of the Philippines, bequeathed her shares to her children and non-profit organizations such as the Daughters of Charity for fear that it would be used as political propaganda. The remaining 30 percent of the stock shares was given to farm workers under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program's Stock Distribution Option scheme.\n\n\n== Current Issues and Problems ==\n\n\n=== Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) ===\nThe signing into law of Republic Act No. 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) on 10 June 1988 signaled the beginning of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) under former President Corazon Aquino. One of the clauses of the CARP provided for a Stock Distribution Option (SDO), which would allow for compliance with the agrarian reform law by distributing stocks of the hacienda to the farm workers rather than actual land.On 9 May 1989, a referendum was held among the farm workers of Hacienda Luisita to determine whether stocks or land would be the means by which the hacienda would be distributed. The results of the May 1989 referendum, as well as a second referendum held in October of the same year, found that a great majority of the Hacienda farm workers voted in favor of distribution of stock rather than land. The terms of the SDO agreement of the Hacienda are quoted as follows:\n\n\u201cAt the end of each fiscal year, for a period of 30 years, the SECOND PARTY (HLI) shall arrange with the FIRST PARTY (TADECO) the acquisition and distribution to the THIRD PARTY (farm workers) on the basis of number of days worked and at no cost to them of one-thirtieth (1/30) of 118,391,976.85 shares of the capital stock of the SECOND PARTY (HLI) that are presently owned and held by the FIRST PARTY (TADECO), until such time as the entire block of 118,391,976.85 shares shall have been completely acquired and distributed to the THIRD PARTY (farm workers).\"\n\nThe SDO agreement however was met with considerable criticism, most notably in 2003 when hacienda workers (farmers, HLI supervisory group workers, union officers) began filing petitions to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to have the SDO agreement revoked due to their dividends and other promised benefits not being given. Daily wage was at P194.50, and there was only one working day per week, due to the mechanizing of some tasks in the hacienda. A petition with more than 5,300 signatures was filed to revoke the SDO agreement and stop land conversion in the hacienda.\nIn 2004, the workers' union tried to negotiate with the management to increase daily wages to P225 and increase work days to 2\u20133 days weekly. Management refused. In 1 October of that year, 327 workers (farm workers and union officers) were retrenched.\n\n\n=== Land reform disputes ===\n\n\n==== November 2004 Massacre ====\nOn 6 November 2004, United Luisita Workers Union (ULWU) and the Central Azucarera de Tarlac Labor Union (CATLU) launched a strike near Gate 1 of the Central Azucarera de Tarlac sugar mill. The protesters were pushing for an increase in their P9.50 weekly wage, increased worker benefits and, more broadly, a greater commitment for national land reform. Over a thousand farmers, and another several thousand union members attended the demonstration.\nOn 16 November 2004, ten days after the start of the said strike, police and soldiers were dispatched by then Labour Secretary Patricia Santo Tom\u00e1s, to storm and disperse the blockade. The enforcers utilized tear gas, water cannons, guns, and military vehicles to disseminate the crowd. Seven of the people participating in the rally were killed, an estimated number of 121 people, adults and children, were injured, and 133 people were arrested and detained.The incident has sparked a national outcry, however, then Deputy Speaker Benigno \u2018Noynoy\u2019 Aquino III, Representative of Tarlac, claims that the dispersal done by the enforcers was justified. A case was filed against the police and military with regards to the injuries and deaths, however it was dismissed by the office of the Ombudsman in 2010. Proceeding that, a motion to reopen the case was filed by the families of the victims, however, it was declined by the Office of the Ombudsman on 2 October 2014.\nThe November 2004 massacre or more popularly known as the Hacienda Luisita massacre is one of the most prominent instances of protest related deaths of Filipinos in recent years. In the months following the Hacienda Luisita massacre, eight more people who either supported or provided evidence to the farmers\u2019 cause were found murdered, beginning with the assassination of peasant leader Marcelino Beltran just before he was to testify about the massacre.\n\n\n==== Revocation of the Stock Distribution Option Agreement ====\nIn the aftermath of the November 2004 massacre, the DAR established Task Force Luisita to conduct further investigations and conduct focus group discussions among the farmers. On 22 September 2005, based on the findings of its investigations, Task Force Luisita recommended the revocation of the SDO agreement forged between Hacienda Luisita Inc. (HLI) and the farm workers. Three months later, on December of the same year, the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) issued a resolution ordering the revocation of the SDO agreement and the distribution of the hacienda's land among the farm workers. Land distribution and the cancellation of the SDO agreement was halted however in June 2006 when the Supreme Court granted the petition of HLI and issued a temporary restraining order on the PARC resolution.On 18 August 2010, oral arguments on the Hacienda Luisita case were heard by the Supreme Court for the first time since the dispute was brought to its doors in 2006. A landmark decision was ultimately reached on 5 July 2011, wherein the Supreme Court lifted the temporary restraining order on the 2005 PARC resolution and upheld both the distribution of land to the hacienda's farm workers and the revocation of the SDO agreement forged in 1989. In acknowledgement of the fact that 93% of the hacienda's farm workers voted in favor of SDO in the 1989 referendum, included in the July 2011 decision was the further mandating of the DAR to hold another referendum to determine which among the hacienda's farm workers would wish to receive land or to remain as stockholders of HLI. This decision to hold another referendum was met with considerable criticism however as critics asserted that agrarian reform laws stipulate that land distribution should be the only viable option and alternatives such as the SDO violate this.On 22 November 2011, the Supreme Court modified its July 2011 decision and revoked the option for the hacienda farm workers to remain as stockholders of HLI, stating:\n\n\u201cUpon a review of the facts and circumstances, We realize that the FWBs [Farmer-Worker Beneficiaries] will never have control over these agricultural lands for as long as they remain as stockholders of HLI\u2026\nIn line with Our finding that control over agricultural lands must always be in the hands of the farmers, We reconsider our ruling that the qualified FWBs should be given an option to remain as stockholders of HLI, inasmuch as these qualified FWBs will never gain control given the present proportion of shareholdings in HLI.\u201d\n\n\n==== Disputes over Landowner Compensation ====\nIn compliance with agrarian reform laws, the Supreme Court decisions further stated that HLI was entitled to payment by the government as just compensation for distributing the hacienda's lands to the farm workers. The corporation was to receive compensation for the distributed land based on its valuation on the date of its taking from HLI.\nIn line with this, HLI presented 2 January 2006 as the appropriate date of taking based on when a Notice of Coverage was issued by the DAR placing the hacienda's land under compulsory acquisition. However the Supreme Court maintained its initial stance that the date of taking be marked at 21 November 1989, based on when the original stock distribution plan was approved, stating this was when ownership of the lands was initially relinquished to make way for its distribution to the farm workers via stock. Under the 2006 valuation of the distributed land, the compensation payment would have amounted to about P5 billion while under the 1989 valuation of the distributed land, the compensation would total only about P200 million.\n\n\n==== April 2012 Supreme Court Ruling ====\nOn 24 April 2012, the Supreme Court released a final and executory decision regarding Hacienda Luisita:\n\n\"To recapitulate, the Court voted on the following issues in this manner:\n1.    In determining the date of taking, the Court voted 8-6 to maintain the ruling fixing November 21, 1989 as the date of taking, the value of the affected lands to be determined by the LBP and the DAR;\n2.    On the propriety of the revocation of the option of the FWBs [Farmer-Worker Beneficiaries] to remain as HLI stockholders, the Court, by unanimous vote, agreed to reiterate its ruling in its November 22, 2011 Resolution that the [stock distribution option] granted to the FWBs stays revoked;\n3.    On the propriety of returning to the FWBs the proceeds of the sale of the 500-hectare converted land and of the 80.51-hectare SCTEX land, the Court unanimously voted to maintain its ruling to order the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the said land to the FWBs less the 3% share, taxes and expenses specified in the fallo of the November 22, 2011 Resolution;\n4.    On the payment of just compensation for the homelots to HLI, the Court, by unanimous vote, resolved to amend its July 5, 2011 Decision and November 22, 2011 Resolution by ordering the government, through the DAR, to pay to HLI the just compensation for the homelots thus distributed to the FWBS.\nWHEREFORE, the Motion to Clarify and Reconsider Resolution of November 22, 2011 dated December 16, 2011 filed by petitioner Hacienda Luisita, Inc. and the Motion for Reconsideration/Clarification dated December 9, 2011 filed by private respondents Noel Mallari, Julio Suniga, Supervisory Group of Hacienda Luisita, Inc. and Windsor Andaya are hereby DENIED with this qualification: the July 5, 2011 Decision, as modified by the November 22, 2011 Resolution, is FURTHER MODIFIED in that the government, through DAR, is ordered to pay Hacienda Luisita, Inc. the just compensation for the 240-square meter homelots distributed to the FWBs.\nThe July 5, 2011 Decision, as modified by the November 22, 2011 Resolution and further modified by this Resolution is declared FINAL and EXECUTORY. The entry of judgment of said decision shall be made upon the time of the promulgation of this Resolution.\nNo further pleadings shall be entertained in this case.\nSO ORDERED.\"\n\n\n== Current status ==\nThe Supreme Court ruling states that the 4,916 hectares of Hacienda Luisita is to be redistributed to 6,296 registered farm-worker beneficiaries, while the Hacienda Luisita Incorporated (HLI) will be receiving 40,000 pesos per hectare as compensation. This is based on the 1989 valuation of the Hacienda Luisita that the Supreme Court had voted upon. But from the 4,916 hectares to be redistributed, 500 hectares were converted into non-agricultural use in 18 August 1996 by the Department of Agrarian Reform, while 80.5 hectares was also subtracted for the development of the Subic Clark Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX). Other inconsistencies within area size have caused conflicting numbers, but according to the DAR this then leaves only 4,099.92 hectares of land to be distributed.The process of land distribution was decided to be through lottery system, wherein the names of the beneficiaries are placed into a drum, and those chosen will be given the Lot Allocation Certificate (LAC). Farmer-worker Beneficiaries then sign the  Application to Purchase and Farmers' Undertaking (APFU), for the registry of their Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA), which is the actual land title. The lottery system had started on 18 July 2013 in Barangay Cutcut, Tarlac City with 340 farmers being given the first batch of Lot Allocation Certificates.  But it was on 30 September 2013, where DAR Secretary Virgilio de los Reyes started awarding the actual Certificate of Land Ownership (CLOA) to 600 Farmer-worker beneficiaries in Barangay Pando.As of 12 July 2016, 4,099 hectares have been already distributed to farmers, but the sales shares from the Hacienda Luisita's converted land to be paid to the farmer-worker beneficiaries have been left unpaid which amounts to 1.3 billion pesos. On 24 April 2017, protesters consisting of the Unyon ng mga Manggagawa sa Agrikultura (UMA) and other militant organizations had gone to Hacienda Luisita to protest against the 348 hectare land that was turned over to Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) back in 25 November 2004 for a 431.7 million peso loan obligation. The protest led to property damage, where protesters had destroyed over 100 meters of a wall surrounding the contested lot. On 21 February 2018, Luisita Land Corporation has since filed a case against 15 farmers for the protest, for malicious mischief and trespassing of the RCBC owned land.As of 4 July 2018, the Hacienda Luisita has fully complied with distributing the sales shares to farmers. The 1.3 billion peso was broken down as such: P500 million received from Luisita Realty Inc. for a 200 hectare lot sold in 1996, P750 million for the selling of Luisita Industrial Park, and around P80 million for the 80.51 hectares used for the SCTEX road network. The ruling also states that 3% of the earlier stock transfers that were paid to the farmers will be deducted from the 1.3 billion to be received.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLand reform in the Philippines\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHacienda Luisita website",

        "wiki": "La Paz (pronounced [la \u02c8pas] (listen), English: The Peace) is the capital city of the Mexican state of Baja California Sur and an important regional commercial center. The city had a 2015 census population of 244,219 inhabitants, making it the most populous city in the state. Its metropolitan population is somewhat larger because of the surrounding towns, such as El Centenario, Chametla and  San Pedro. It is in La Paz Municipality, which is the fourth-largest municipality in Mexico in geographical size and reported a population of 290,286 inhabitants on a land area of 20,275 km2 (7,828 sq mi).The population of La Paz has grown greatly since the 2000s. The growth is largely because the city has one of the highest standards of living and security in Mexico.La Paz is served by the Manuel M\u00e1rquez de Le\u00f3n International Airport with flights to the most important cities of Mexico: Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey. Airlines flying into La Paz include  Aerom\u00e9xico Connect, Volaris and VivaAerobus. Two ferry services operate from the port of Pichilingue outside the city, connecting the Baja California peninsula to the mainland at Mazatl\u00e1n and Topolobampo, near Los Mochis.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is located on the Baja California peninsula on the Bay of La Paz, 210 kilometres (130 mi) south of Ciudad Constituci\u00f3n, municipality of Comond\u00fa, and 202 kilometres (126 mi) north of Cabo San Lucas, municipality of Los Cabos. It is located 81 kilometres (50 mi) north of the town of Todos Santos. Its geographical coordinates are 24\u00b008\u203232\u2033 N and parallel 110\u00b018\u203239\u2033W, it has an altitude of 0 to 27 meters above the sea level. It is one of the three state capitals of Mexico that are on the coast of the sea.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Spanish discovery ===\n\nThe first European known to have landed in Baja California was Fort\u00fan Xim\u00e9nez. In 1533, shortly after the conquest of Tenochtitlan, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s sent two ships, Concepci\u00f3n, under the command of captain and commander of the expedition, Diego de Becerra, and San L\u00e1zaro under Capt. Hernando de Grijalva, to explore the South Seas of the Pacific Ocean. The ships set out November 30, 1533, to travel north along the coast of New Spain from present-day Manzanillo, Colima, in search of two ships that had been lost without a trace on a similar voyage the previous year. By December 20 the ships had separated; San L\u00e1zaro, which had gone ahead, waited three days for Concepci\u00f3n and after no sighting of its companion vessel, Capt. Grijalva dedicated himself to exploring the region and discovered the Revillagigedo Islands. On board the Concepci\u00f3n, the navigator and second in command, Fort\u00fan Jim\u00e9nez, led a mutiny in which Capt. Becerra was killed, then attacked the crewmen loyal to the murdered captain, abandoning the wounded on the coast of Michoac\u00e1n along with the friars Franciscans who had accompanied him the expedition.\nJim\u00e9nez sailed to the northwest following the coast and at some point turned west and reached a bay that is now the port of the city of La Paz. Jim\u00e9nez thought that he had found an island, and never knew that it was a large peninsula. There he met natives who wore few clothes and spoke an unknown language; their culture was very different from that of the inhabitants of the Mexican highlands. The sexually deprived crews of his ships saw the scantily-clad women and took them by force. The Spaniards soon became aware of the large pearls that the natives extracted from the pearl oysters abounding in the bay, and proceeded to plunder the people and rape their women. Jim\u00e9nez and his men did not name any of the places they found, it would be left to other explorers to name the places visited by Fort\u00fan Jim\u00e9nez.\nThe abuse of the Indian women by the crew and their looting caused a violent confrontation with the natives that ended in the deaths of Fort\u00fan Jim\u00e9nez and some of his companions; the survivors withdrew, and sailed erratically for several days until they reached the shores of the present-day Jalisco, where they encountered a subaltern of Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n, who requisitioned the ship and took them prisoner.\n\n\n=== Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s arrives in California and founds the town of Santa Cruz ===\nHaving sponsored two exploratory voyages in the South Seas with no material results, Cort\u00e9s decided to lead a third exploration himself. Annoyed that his enemy, Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n, had requisitioned one of his ships during the first expedition, Cort\u00e9s decided to confront Guzm\u00e1n on his own ground and from there set up the third expedition; consequently he prepared a large force of infantry and cavalry to march on the province of New Galicia, of which Guzm\u00e1n was governor.\nThe viceroy of New Spain, Antonio de Mendoza, warned Cort\u00e9s on September 4, 1534, \"not to confront he who had requisitioned his ships\", a warning which Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s ignored, claiming that he had been designated to conquer and discover new territories, and that he had spent more than 100 thousand gold ducats of his own fortune. The feared confrontation between the armies of Cort\u00e9s and Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n did not occur.\nIn Chametla, (Sinaloa), after crossing the present-day states of Jalisco and Nayarit, territory then known as part of New Galicia, Cort\u00e9s and his entourage embarked the ships  Santa \u00c1gueda  and  San L\u00e1zaro  with 113 crewmen and 40 cavalrymen with their horses and gear, leaving 60 riders on land, as reported to the Real Audiencia and Governor Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n. Cort\u00e9s then sailed in a northwestly direction, and on May 3, 1535 arrived at the bay he named Bahia de la Santa Cruz (Bay of Santa Cruz), currently the port of La Paz, where he confirmed the death of his subordinate, Fort\u00fan Jim\u00e9nez, at the hands of the natives. Once Cort\u00e9s had taken possession of the bay, he decided to establish a colony and summoned the soldiers and arms he had left in Sinaloa. The transport ships were lost in a storm, however, and only one ship, carrying a load of fifty bushels of corn, returned. This was insufficient to feed the population, so Cort\u00e9s left to personally secure food, but was unable to procure enough, so he decided to return to New Spain with the intention of supplying the new colony from there.\nFrancisco de Ulloa was in command of the town of La Paz, but complaints by relatives of those who had stayed on the peninsula caused the viceroy to order the population to abandon the colony and return to New Spain. Following this failure of Cort\u00e9s' third expedition to establish a colony in the newly discovered lands that belonged to him by royal decree, an enemy of Cort\u00e9s, whom a writer of the time cites as Alarc\u00f3n, gave the name of the abandoned land in a mocking tone as California to insult him.\nThe Baja California peninsula, the Gulf of California (also known as the Sea of Cortez), and the states of California, Baja California and Baja California Sur, bear the name today.\nFrom January 10, 1854, to May 8, 1854, La Paz served as the capital of William Walker's Republic of Sonora. The project collapsed due to lack of US support and pressure from the Mexican government to retake the region.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nLa Paz has a desert climate. The climate of La Paz is relatively consistent with generally little rainfall, with a year around average temperature of between 17 and 30 \u00b0C (63 and 86 \u00b0F). Summer months (July\u2013September) typically see highs between 34 and 36 \u00b0C (93 and 97 \u00b0F) and dew points of 21\u201323 \u00b0C (70\u201373 \u00b0F). The winter months (December\u2013February) are the coldest with temperatures dropping below 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) at night, but mostly maxima are from 20 to 25 \u00b0C (68 to 77 \u00b0F). Breezes from Bah\u00eda de La Paz moderate the temperature. The bay also acts as a barrier against seasonal storms in the Gulf of California.\nRainfall is minimal at most times of year, although erratic downpours can bring heavy rains.  Rain tends to be concentrated in a short, slightly rainier season that peaks in August and September, following the pattern of the North American Monsoon.  The driest season, where it is common to have no rain, occurs March through June. La Paz averages over 300 days of sunshine annually and an average of 3148 sunshine hours.\nDuring the summer the cooling Coromuel winds, a weather phenomenon unique to the La Paz area, blow during the night from the Pacific over the Peninsula and into the Bay of La Paz.\nAs with most of the Gulf of California, the temperature of the water changes substantially over the course of the year, with temperatures around 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C) during winter and around 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) during summer.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe population of La Paz has grown greatly since the 2000s.\nEco-tourism is by far the most important source of tourism income in La Paz. Tourists also visit the city's balnearios. There are some 900 islands and inlets in the Gulf of California with 244 now under UNESCO protection as World Heritage Bio-Reserves and the Isla Esp\u00edritu Santo group, which borders the northeast portion of the Bay of La Paz, the primary tourist destination of the area.\nIndustries include silver mining, agriculture, fishing and pearls. Tourism is also an important source of employment for this coastal community.\nAlong with the area's marinas, new developments are emerging because of the proximity to the United States.When Aero California existed, its headquarters were in La Paz.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nLa Paz is served by Manuel M\u00e1rquez de Le\u00f3n International Airport with flights to the most important cities of Mexico: Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey. Airlines flying into La Paz include  Aerom\u00e9xico Connect, Volaris and VivaAerobus. Two ferry services operate from the port of Pichilingue outside the city, connecting the Baja California peninsula to the mainland at Mazatl\u00e1n and Topolobampo, near Los Mochis.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nRunning along the coast in front of La Paz is 5 km (3.1 mi) long Malecon Road.  The main purpose of this road is to allow easy movement across the city. However, it quickly became the focal point of tourist related activities with a large number of bars, restaurants and shops opening along its length. Since 2004 extensive development has taken place which included a large sidewalk which offers safety for large numbers of people to walk along the coastal front of La Paz.\nIn September 2011, a bicycle lane was added to Malecon Road, providing cyclists protection from cars and pedestrians.\nLa Paz is served mainly by two highways; Mexican Federal Highway 1 that links the south of the state from Cabo San Lucas to the north of the peninsula to Tijuana, and Mexican Federal Highway 19, that connects La Paz with the population of the south pacific towns such as Todos Santos and El Pescadero. It is also served by two secondary roads, the Los Planes highway (286) that connects La Paz with towns such as La Ventana, Ensenada de los Muertos and Los Planes. The other is the Pichilingue highway which links La Paz with its maritime port.\n\n\n== Gastronomy ==\n\nLocal cuisine is characterized by seafood dishes, especially of lobster, sole, clams and shrimp. Oregano is frequently used as a spice, and damiana, an ingredient in a traditional liqueur, is widely regarded as an aphrodisiac and brewed as a tea.\nRegional cuisine also includes traditional dishes such as machaca, made from beef that has been well-cooked, shredded, and then cooked in its own juices, fresh cheeses and the typical flour tortillas. Abundantly available clams are prepared in various ways such as pickling, breading and frying, or stuffing. Shrimp are plentiful also, and eaten grilled, fried, or baked as in the regional specialty, filete imperial de camarones. Other popular seafood dishes include callo garra de le\u00f3n, made with scallops, fish tatemado, and ceviche.\nRegional sweets are represented by fruits such as guava, mango and pitaya, green papaya and fig in syrup, as well as dehydrated regional fruits such as white fig and mango. Cheese empanadas (empanadas de queso) and empanadas made with sweet beans are also popular.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe city had a 2015 census population of 244,219 inhabitants, making it the most populous city in the state. Its metropolitan population is somewhat larger because of surrounding towns, such as El Centenario (pop. 6,068), Chametla (pop. 1,731 as of 2010) and San Pedro. Its surrounding municipality, which is the fourth-largest municipality in Mexico in geographical size, reported a population of 290,286 inhabitants.\n\n\n== Education ==\nLa Paz is the state capital and center of commerce, as well as the home of the three leading marine biology institutes in Latin America (UABCS, CIBNOR & CICIMAR), largely because it sits on the Gulf of California, which is home to exceptional marine biodiversity. It also supports several other university-level institutes of learning, such as the Universidad Autonoma de Baja California Sur.\nLa Paz is the headquarters of several higher education centers, the main ones being:\n\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Baja California Sur (UABCS)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de La Paz (UTLP)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de La Paz (ITLP)\nUniversidad Mundial (UM)\nCentro Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Marinas (CICIMAR)\nCentro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del Noroeste (CIBNOR)\nCentro de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y de Educaci\u00f3n Superior de Ensenada (CICESE) Campus La Paz\nBenem\u00e9rita Escuela Normal Urbana Prof. Domingo Carballo F\u00e9lix (BENU)\nEscuela Normal Superior del Estado de Baja California Sur (ENSBCS).\nUniversidad Internacional de La Paz (UNIPAZ)\nUniversidad de Tijuana Campus La Paz (CUT)\nTecnol\u00f3gico de Baja California.\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica Campus La Paz.\nUniversidad del Desarrollo Profesional (UNIDEP) Plantel La Paz\nUniversidad Intercontinental\nInstituto Mar de Cort\u00e9s.\nInstituto Cultural Tecnol\u00f3gico Cuincacalli (ICTEC)\nCentro de Capacitaci\u00f3n para el Trabajo Industrial (CECATI 39)\nEscuela Superior de Cultura F\u00edsica para Baja California Sur (ESCUFI).\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de La Paz (UTLP)\n\n\n== Health ==\nLa Paz has several medical centers; the Secretariat of Health operates the Juan Mar\u00eda de Salvatierra general hospital, which has medical specialists and an exclusive area for pediatric oncology, as well as a unit that provides medical care under the national health insurance program, as well as a hemodialysis unit, a blood bank, a mental health division, health centers and other units. The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) provides a family clinic and an ambulatory medical unit in which ambulatory surgeries are performed. There is also a new ISSSTE hospital, the Naval Sanatorium, and the Secretariat of National Defense hospital, which offers external consultation services, hospitalization and medical specialists.\nReflecting high national rates, there are similarly high local rates of diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and renal insufficiency, as well as of automobile accidents resulting in injury, despite public health dissemination programs and driver education programs.\nAccording to the Baja California Sur State Development Plan 2005-2011, during 2006 there were 24 deaths due to cervical cancer in the state. The health sector seeks to reduce cervical cancer mortality by providing timely treatment to women aged 25 to 64 years, and improving the efficiency of diagnostic laboratories and the monitoring of patients.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nJohn Steinbeck visited La Paz in 1940. He describes the town in his 1947 novel The Pearl and mentions it extensively in his 1951 travelogue The Log from the Sea of Cortez.The city is also the setting of the 1967 Scott O'Dell children's novel The Black Pearl, chosen as a Newbery Honor Book in 1968; La Paz is the home of the main character.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n Ensenada, Mexico\n Redondo Beach, United States\n Rosarito, Mexico\n Tijuana, Mexico\n\n\n== See also ==\n Mexico portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Ayuntamiento de La Paz (Municipality of La Paz) website (in Spanish)",

          "Would love to come back some day when the weather is not so cool; this was an unusual spell,they said ( end of Feb 2018) ; but the beach was gorgeous. I wish they weren't building stuff so close to it..... but what a lovely view those condo swill have. I hear there are nice",
          "This beach is more difficult to access. You have to walk much farther from the parking lot and it is not as developed. But there are fewer people. The water can be rough at the beach but it is very good snorkeling in a small cove that is well protected.",
          "Even though a lot has changed here over the last 15 Year\u2019s, this is still a great beach to visit and snorkel! The dirt road and isolation has been replaced with a proper parking lot and a new resort, but it\u2019s still a great spot.",

          "Went to Santa Maria beach to do some snorkeling, beach was nice although the sand is really rough on the beach. The water was choppy that day, and the visibility was down but otherwise its a nice place to go, and it actually has bathroom facilities and showers now as well.",
          "This is a must experience for the Cabo area. You can check this one off your bucket list. The water is clear and deep and the fish area within reach of your fingertips. The colors are vibrant and the water is warm. We picked up mask and snorkels at the local Walmart and had a",
          "Place is amazing, this is a public beach, however it is extremely clean, it has a wonderful view and a great vibe!!",
          "Nice beach and great for snorkeling. IF you can get a private boat, which we did, see if you can find Martin around the PADI window near the end of the marina a short distance from Senor Frogs. He can be bartered with as many of them can so we got a good price for the 4 of us.",
          "We went here from recommendations and we were pleasantly surprised! We sat on the beach and had some snacks and after a few hours some of us ran back to the condo we were staying at and made some lunch and brought it back for a beach side picnic. Great spot for families too.",
          "Quite a bit of construction occurring. Sand is a challenge--deep, small pebbles but it is worth it! A gorgeous place to enjoy the ocean. Umbrellas, gorgeous water, great place to swim.",
          "We fell in love with Santa Maria Beach several years ago and return each year to snorkel and relax on it's beautiful coral colored sand. Simply said, it is STUNNING! Because it is in a small cove, it is much smaller than Chileno beach just a few minutes down the road. The",

          "Very Clean , water was so clear the beach is incredible and the snorkeling was amazing. There was only one vendor trying to sell stuff he was good when denied. Too bad they are building so close to such a nice public beach. Very enjoyable",

          "This is a beautiful beach! There was a large parking lot and bathrooms (no water as of Jan 4th 2018). The beach is cove-shaped, so it doesn't feel too crowded and the waters are very calm with some of the best snorkeling around! Tour boats can be irritating but don't stay long.",

          "We have visited this beach by car since 1994 and have always come expecting hoards of fish among the reefs in this somewhat magical bay. What was once a quaint park in the mid-90\u2019s, we have watched as development has encroached and vendors park boats offloading dozens of",

          "A bit harder to find to as you need to watch the signs but a nice clean beach with parking and bathroom. Snorkeling is good on either side of the cove. Chileno is better for snorkeling but this cove is nicer when seas are rough as it is protected.",
          "Did a lot of swimming here. Waves are gentle enough for safe swimming. saw a lot of fish in the water.",
          "very beautiful beach to spend some time with your loved ones, sunsets are specially breath taking in the santa maria beach!",

          "We checked the beach out one evening and it was quiet with a nice calm surf rolling in and out. Hurricane Lydia had torn up some of the walkways but the shower area was still operating to clean sandy shoes. We returned a few days later and it was packed with locals and tourists",

          "Santa Maria has changed a lot over the years. When I visited last month, construction was underway for hotels and/or condos. The path from the new parking lot down to the beach is longer than from the old dirt parking lot, but it\u2019s paved. (Keep an eye out for desert iguanas.)",
          "The beach has recently been upgraded with a new parking lot, rest rooms,showers and sidewalk to the beach. Snorkeling to the right side of the beach was awesome. The water temperature was at least 10 degrees warmer than that at Cabo San Lucas.",

          "Its was fantastic nothing better then the beach and sun...",
          "Incredible snorkeling, especially if you go early before the tour boats arrive. There are also a few free palapas, again if you arrive early. Great for kids to play and swim with supervision! Highly recommended!",
          "Very nice place to hang out!",
          "This is one of the prettiest beaches in Cabo. It's a protected cove, ideal for swimming. \n\nThere are several small palapa's there, but it pays to bring your own shade. \n\nVery nice and clean bathrooms next to the paved parking lot. \n\nIt is ~ 250 meter walk from the parking lot to the beach, on a oaved walkway.",
          "Best public beach in Los Cabos.  Definitely there are tour boats that come in, but the beach experience is excellent.  it is definitely a bay and both sides are full of fish.  Buses drop you off there and there is a parking lot as well as great showers and bathroom with few people around   enjoy it.",
          "Nice beach. We went here by boat. The waves were a little rough to swim in.",

          "Santa Maria Bay used to be one of my favorite beaches, but with the construction of the new resort there its not the same. Also too many excurtions and boat traffic have polluted the water. You can now feel the chemicals like oils in the water. Great scenery, not the same experience.",

          "Nice beach. Was able to bring beer in a cooler. Felt very comfortable and safe.",
          "Breathtakingly beautiful and not too developed yet!  The snorkeling was lovely, the beach was perfect, the people were kind, and there were nice bathrooms as well. There is a very very very small sign on the edge of the west side of the freeway signifying the entrance, and it's a bit of a walk down - but worth it.",
          "We snorkeled here, participating in of one of several organized tours, so plan on lots of company! The water is a little murky, but there are abundant fish of many types, and the location is pretty sheltered from most wave action. Numerous humpback whales we're visible a way offshore.",
          "What a great beach! Their is free umbrellas in exchange for your idea as you come on the beach, courtesy of the city. There are also rentals if they run out. This is where many tour boats come to bring snorkeling tours, so they can get a \u2026",

Very clean beach not many people especially during day, easy aces to public bus and there is bathroom close buy. You have to bring your drink and snacks, there is no food vendors.",
          "The beach is great and the water is beautiful.  The snorkeling is also very good.  The only downside was the excursions from the cruise ships come here. I guess you cant have everything.",
          "Great beach for snorkeling, and relaxation must be a good swimmer it can get pretty deep but with great rewards lots of finding nemos.",
          "Awesome snorkeling. Not crowded during the week. A little crowded on the weekends. one of the best well kept beaches public restroom open during the day and rince showers.

          "We snorkled here and the fish were bright colors and lots of schools of fish. We went on a snorkeling trip out of the marina down to St. Maria beach.",
          "Great beach to relax away from crowds.  Clean bathrooms, life guard.  Nice Bay.",
          "Too many boats churn up the water. Can't see anything snorkeling. Fish are fed crackers so they swim near you. Water temperature is awesome",
          "Great place to do snorkeling, clean shower area and bathrooms. Surf was too much for small kids. Larger pebble sand hurt my feet but over all a great well kept place.",
          "Love spending my days here when ever I can .",
          "Clean beach, blue flag certified, clean restroom facilities although a bit of a walk, wheelchair accessible, lifeguard on duty and great snorkeling.",
          "Went there with Cabo Adventures, and went snorkeling. Lots of pretty little fish.  Looked like a nice beach. Quite a few people, and it's the slow season.  It is pretty calm and good for swimming, it is fairly secluded from the ocean.\n\nI would recommend Cabo Adventures too. They were pretty awesome.",
          "Great access to Beach and has showers and bathrooms. You can overnight there and there is 24 hour video surveillance. We plan to stay there with our camper.",
          "Beautiful beach, snorkeling, safe swimming, free wifi, no food available on the beach. Nearby resorts offer dining, not sure if it is for public.",
          "Still nice but I fear overdevelopment is taking its toll. Was here seven years ago and since then the pluses have been a paved parking lot, shaded paved path to beach and a newer bathroom (bring t.p. just in case) Minuses are a new resort on the beach where brush used to be and the never ending catamarans and tour boats. Ah Mexico!",
          "Last Beach visited on our trip. We will definitely return. Bring ice chest, lunch and beverages. Such a great cove",

          "Ok beach.\nLooks nice as must of them are, but nothing special...it is Swimable although tides can be strong on the south side of it. Not very fine sand but ok. Better go north, on your right as you get on the beach from the entrance.",
          "It's amazing!!! Love it.  Beautiful coral pink sand.",
          "I love snorkeling at this beach! It's an awesome beach because since it is a bay the current doesn't pull you towards deeper ocean. I've been to this beach several times and every single time I love it!",

          "Great little beach for swimming and snorkeling. Very clean. Restrooms and showers. This is a Blue Flag Beach and the latest water quality report is posted. There is construction going on beach front but still worth a visit for the snorkeling.",

          "From the beach to the drinks to the people there very enjoyable and a great time.",
          "We were taken here on a snorkelling trip. Nice, but not to many fish to see.",

          "Amazing beach in Cabo, not too busy and great whale watching in the mornings!",
          "It was a construction site! Condos,condos and more condos, in  the works while we were suppose to snorkel there. Also there were 12 assorted vessels in the bay at the time we were there. Can you imagine how much warmer that tiny bay got with all the partying folks there? I didn't go in by the way. I partyed with the crew.",

          "Beautiful bay with crystal clear water. Perfect to swim and have a quiet time.",
          "There are very few spots of shadow, better if you take your own. Also the sand are rocks and of walk a lot they can hurt. The waves are not so big, however, they can drag you since they are sea currents underneath. In conclusion, the waves are not so big can swim but just need to be careful with some waves. ",

        "wiki": "Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz   (12 November 1648 \u2013 17 April 1695) was a Mexican writer, philosopher, composer, poet of the Baroque period, and Hieronymite nun of New Spain (Mexico). Her outspoken opinions granted her lifelong names such as \"The Tenth Muse\" and \"The Phoenix of Mexico\", for she was a flame that rose from the ashes of \"religious authoritarianism\".Sor Juana lived during Mexico's colonial period, making her a contributor both to early Spanish literature as well as to the broader literature of the Spanish Golden Age. Beginning her studies at a young age, Sor Juana was fluent in Latin and also wrote in Nahuatl, and became known for her philosophy in her teens. Sor Juana educated herself in her own library, which was mostly inherited from her grandfather. After joining a nunnery in 1667, Sor Juana began writing poetry and prose dealing with such topics as love, feminism, and religion. She turned her nun's quarters into a salon, visited by the city's intellectual elite. Among them was Countess Maria Luisa de Paredes, Vicereine of Mexico. Her criticism of misogyny and the hypocrisy of men led to her condemnation by the Bishop of Puebla, and in 1694 she was forced to sell her collection of books and focus on charity towards the poor. She died the next year, having caught the plague while treating her sister.After fading from academic discourse for hundreds of years, Octavio Paz re-established Sor Juana's importance in modern times. Scholars now interpret Sor Juana as a protofeminist, and she is the subject of vibrant discourses about themes such as colonialism, education rights, women's religious authority, and writing as examples of feminist advocacy. \n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nJuana In\u00e9s de Asbaje y Ram\u00edrez de Santillana was born in San Miguel Nepantla (now called Nepantla de Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz in her honor) near Mexico City. She was the illegitimate child of a Spanish captain, Pedro Manuel de Asbaje, and a Criolla woman, Isabel Ram\u00edrez. Due to her Spanish ancestry and Mexican birth, Juana is considered a Criolla. Juana was baptized 2 December 1651 and described on the baptismal rolls as \"a daughter of the Church\", although her biological father, according to all accounts, was absent from her life. However, thanks to her maternal grandfather, who owned an Hacienda in Amecameca, Juana lived a comfortable life. She spent her early years living with her mother on his estate, Panoaya.During her childhood, Juana often hid in the Hacienda chapel to read her grandfather's books from the adjoining library, something forbidden to girls. By the age of three, Juana had learned how to read and write Latin. By the age of five, she reportedly could do accounts. At age eight, she composed a poem on the Eucharist. By adolescence, Juana had mastered Greek logic, and at age thirteen she was teaching Latin to young children. She also learned the Aztec language of Nahuatl and wrote some short poems in that language.\n\nIn 1664, at the age of 16, Juana was sent to live in Mexico City. She asked her mother's permission to disguise herself as a male student so that she could enter the university there. Without the ability to obtain formal education, Juana continued her studies privately. She was a lady-in-waiting at the colonial viceroy's court, where she came under the tutelage of the Vicereine Leonor Carreto (in Italian, Leonor del Carretto), wife of the Viceroy of New Spain Antonio Sebasti\u00e1n de Toledo. The viceroy, the Marquis de Mancera, wishing to test the learning and intelligence of the 17-year-old, invited several theologians, jurists, philosophers, and poets to a meeting, during which she had to answer many questions unprepared and explain several difficult points on various scientific and literary subjects. The manner in which she acquitted herself astonished all present and greatly increased her reputation. Her literary accomplishments garnered her fame throughout New Spain. She was much admired in the viceregal court, and she received several proposals of marriage, which she declined.\n\n\n=== As a nun ===\nIn 1667, she entered the Monastery of St. Joseph, a community of the Discalced Carmelite nuns, as a postulant, where she remained but a few months. Later, in 1669, she entered the monastery of the Hieronymite nuns, which had more relaxed rules. She chose to become a nun so that she could study as she wished since she wanted \"to have no fixed occupation which might curtail my freedom to study.\"\n\nIn the convent and perhaps earlier, Sor Juana became intimate friends with fellow savant, Don Carlos de Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora, who visited her in the convent's locutorio. She stayed cloistered in the Convent of Santa Paula of the Hieronymite in Mexico City from 1669 until her death, and there she studied, wrote, and collected a large library of books. The Viceroy and Vicereine of New Spain became her patrons; they supported her and had her writings published in Spain. She addressed some of her poems to paintings of her friend and patron Mar\u00eda Luisa Manrique de Lara y Gonzaga, daughter of Vespasiano Gonzaga, Duca di Guastala, Luzara e Rechiolo and In\u00e9s Mar\u00eda Manrique, 9th Countess de Paredes, which she also addressed as L\u00edsida.\n\nIn November 1690, the bishop of Puebla, Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez de Santa Cruz published, under the pseudonym of Sor Filotea, and without her permission, Sor Juana's critique of a 40-year-old sermon by Father Ant\u00f3nio Vieira, a Portuguese Jesuit preacher. Although Sor Juana's intentions for the work, called Carta Atenag\u00f3rica are left to interpretation, many scholars have opted to interpret the work as a challenge to the hierarchical structure of religious authority. Along with Carta Atenag\u00f3rica, the bishop also published his own letter in which he said she should focus on religious instead of secular studies. He published his criticisms to use them to his advantage against the priest, and while he agreed with her criticisms, he believed that as a woman, she should devote herself to prayer and give up her writings.\nIn response to her critics, Sor Juana wrote a letter, Respuesta a Sor Filotea de la Cruz (Reply to Sister Philotea), in which she defended women's right to formal education. She also advocated for women's right to serve as intellectual authorities, not only through the act of writing, but also through the publication of their writing. By putting women, specifically older women, in positions of authority, Sor Juana argued, women could educate other women. Resultingly, Sor Juana argued, this practice could also avoid potentially dangerous situations involving male teachers in intimate settings with young female students.In addition to being a woman in a self-prescribed position of authority, Sor Juana's radical position made her an increasingly controversial figure. She famously remarked by quoting an Aragonese poet and echoing St. Teresa of \u00c1vila: \"One can perfectly well philosophize while cooking supper.\" In response, Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas, Archbishop of Mexico joined other high-ranking officials in condemning Sor Juana's \"waywardness.\" In addition to opposition she received for challenging the patriarchal structure of the Catholic Church, Sor Juana was repeatedly criticized for believing that her writing could achieve the same philanthropic goals as community work.By 1693, she seemingly ceased to write, rather than risking official censure. However, there is no undisputed evidence of her renouncing devotion to letters, but there are documents showing her agreeing to undergo penance. Her name is affixed to such a document in 1694, but given her deep natural lyricism, the tone of the supposed handwritten penitentials is in rhetorical and autocratic Church formulae; one is signed \"Yo, la Peor de Todas\" (\"I, the worst of all women\"). She is said to have sold all her books, then an extensive library of over 4,000 volumes, and her musical and scientific instruments as well. Other sources report that her defiance toward the church led to all of her books and instruments being confiscated although the bishop himself agreed with the contents of her letters.Of over one hundred unpublished works, only a few of her writings have survived, which are known as the Complete Works. According to Octavio Paz, her writings were saved by the vicereine.She died after ministering to other nuns stricken during a plague, on 17 April 1695. Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora delivered the eulogy at her funeral.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Poetry ===\n\n\n==== First Dream ====\n\nFirst Dream, a long philosophical and descriptive silva (a poetic form combining verses of 7 and 11 syllables), \"deals with the shadow of night beneath which a person falls asleep in the midst of quietness and silence, where night and day animals participate, either dozing or sleeping, all urged to silence and rest by Harpocrates. The person's body ceases its ordinary operations, which are described in physiological and symbolical terms, ending with the activity of the imagination as an image-reflecting apparatus: the Pharos. From this moment, her soul, in a dream, sees itself free at the summit of her own intellect; in other words, at the apex of an own pyramid-like mount, which aims at God and is luminous.There, perched like an eagle, she contemplates the whole creation, but fails to comprehend such a sight in a single concept. Dazzled, the soul's intellect faces its own shipwreck, caused mainly by trying to understand the overwhelming abundance of the universe, until reason undertakes that enterprise, beginning with each individual creation, and processing them one by one, helped by the Aristotelic method of ten categories.The soul cannot get beyond questioning herself about the traits and causes of a fountain and a flower, intimating perhaps that his method constitutes a useless effort, since it must take into account all the details, accidents, and mysteries of each being. By that time, the body has consumed all its nourishment, and it starts to move and wake up, soul and body are reunited. The poem ends with the Sun overcoming Night in a straightforward battle between luminous and dark armies, and with the poet's awakening.\n\n\n==== Dramas ====\nIn addition to the two comedies outlined here (Pawns of a House [Los empe\u00f1os de una casa] and Love is but a Labyrinth [Amor es mas laberinto]), Sor Juana is attributed as the author of a possible ending to the comedy by Agustin de Salazar: The Second Celestina (La Segunda Celestina).  In the 1990s, Guillermo Schmidhuber found a release of the comedy that contained a different ending than the otherwise known ending.  He proposed that those one thousand words were written by Sor Juana.  Some literary critics, such as Octavio Paz, Georgina Sabat-Rivers, and Luis Leal) have accepted Sor Juana as the co-author, but others, such as Antonio Alatorre and Jos\u00e9 Pascual Bux\u00f3, have refuted it.\n\n\n=== Comedies ===\nScholars have debated the meaning of Juana's comedies. Julie Greer Johnson describes how Juana protested against the rigorously defined relationship between genders through her full-length comedies and humor. She argues that Juana recognized the negative view of women in comedy which was designed to uphold male superiority at the expense of women. By recognizing the power of laughter, Juana appropriated the purpose of humor, and used it as a socially acceptable medium with which to question notions of men and women.Pawns of a House\nThe work was first performed on October 4, 1683, during the celebration of the Viceroy Count of Paredes\u2019 first son's birth.  Some critics maintain that it could have been set up for the Archbishop Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas\u2019 entrance to the capital, but this theory is not considered reliable.The story revolves around two couples who are in love but, by chance of fate, cannot yet be together. This comedy of errors is considered one of the most prominent works of late baroque Spanish-American literature.  One of its most peculiar characteristics is that the driving force in the story is a woman with a strong, decided personality who expresses her desires to a nun. The protagonist of the story, Dona Leonor, fits the archetype perfectly.It is often considered the peak of Sor Juana's work and even the peak of all New-Hispanic literature. Pawns of a House is considered a rare work in colonial Spanish-American theater due to the management of intrigue, representation of the complicated system of marital relationships, and the changes in urban life.Love is but a Labyrinth\nThe work premiered on February 11, 1689, during the celebration of the inauguration of the viceroyalty Gaspar de la Cerda y Mendoza. However, in his Essay on Psychology, Ezequiel A. Chavez mentions Fernandez del Castillo as a coauthor of this comedy.The plot takes on the well-known theme in Greek mythology of Theseus: a hero from Crete Island.  He fights against the Minotaur and awakens the love of Ariadne and Fedra.  Sor Juana conceived Theseus as the archetype of the baroque hero, a model also used by her fellow countryman Juan Ruis de Alarcon. Theseus\u2019 triumph over the Minotaur does not make Theseus proud, but instead allows him to be humble.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nBesides poetry and philosophy, Sor Juana was interested in science, mathematics and music. The latter represents an important aspect because, not only because musicality was an intrinsic part of the poetry of the time but also for the fact that she devoted a significant portion of her studies to the theory of instrumental tuning that, especially in the Baroque period, had reached a point of critical importance. So involved was Sor Juana in the study of music, that she wrote a treatise called El Caracol (unfortunately lost) that sought to simplify musical notation and solve the problems that Pythagorean tuning suffered.\nIn the writings of Juana Ines, it is possible to detect the importance of sound. We can observe this in two ways. First of all, the analysis of music and the study of musical temperament appears in several of her poems. For instance, in the following poem, Sor Juana delves into the natural notes and the accidents of musical notation.Propiedad es de natura\nque entre Dios y el hombre media,\ny del cielo el be cuadrado\njunto al be bemol de la tierra.\n(Villancico 220)\nOn the other, Sarah Finley offers an interesting idea. She argues that the visual is related with patriarchal themes, while the sonorous offers an alternative to the feminine space in the work of Sor Juana. As an example of this, Finley points out that Narciso falls in love with a voice, and not with a reflection.\n\n\n=== Other notable works ===\nOne musical work attributed to Sor Juana survives from the archive of Guatemala Cathedral. This is a 4-part villancico, Madre, la de los primores.\n\n\n== Translations and Interpretations ==\n\nWhile Octavio Paz is credited with re-establishing the importance of the historic Sor Juana in modern times, other scholars have been instrumental in translating Sor Juana's work. The only translations of Carta Atenagorica are found in Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz: Selected Writings by Pamela Kirk Rappaport and The Tenth Muse: Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz by Fanchon Royer. Translations of Sor Juana's La Respuesta are credited to Electa Arenal and Amanda Powell, Edith Grossman, Margaret Seyers Peden, and Alan S. Trubeblood. These translations are respectively found in The Answer/La Respuesta, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz: Selected Works, A Woman of Genius: The Intellectual Biography of Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz and Poems, Protest, and a Dream, and A Sor Juana Anthology.Since Sor Juana's works were rediscovered after her death, scholarly interpretations and translations are both abundant and contrasting. \n\n\n=== Tarsicio Herrera Zapi\u00e9n ===\nTarsicio Herrera Zapi\u00e9n, a classical scholar, has also devoted much of his career to the study of Sor Juana's works. Some of his publications (in Spanish) include Buena fe y humanismo en Sor Juana: di\u00e1logos y ensayos: las obras latinas: los sorjuanistas recientes (1984); L\u00f3pez Velarde y sor Juana, feministas opuestos: y cuatro ensayos sobre Horacio y Virgilio en M\u00e9xico (1984); Poemas mexicanos universales: de Sor Juana a L\u00f3pez Velarde (1989) and Tres siglos y cien vidas de Sor Juana (1995).\n\n\n=== Feminist analyses and translations ===\nScholars such as Scout Frewer argue that because Juana's advocacy for religious and intellectual authority would now be associated with feminism, she was a protofeminist. In the twenty-first century, scholars generally interpret Sor Juana as a feminist before the time of feminism.\nFor instance, scholars like Rachel O\u2019Donnell argue that Sor Juana occupied a special place in between socially acceptable and socially unacceptable roles in seventeenth century Mexico. By examining Sor Juana intersectionally, they prioritize the context of New Spain, specifically the influence of religion, race, and social norms, in understanding Sor Juana as a female theologian and poet.According to O\u2019Donnell, in colonial Mexico, education was an undertaking reserved for men, especially activities like writing and reading. Consequently, scholars like Octavio Paz argue, religion became a way for women to avoid marriage. Since Sor Juana was opposed to marriage, Paz argues, entering the convent was a socially acceptable way to be a single woman in seventeenth century Mexico. Entering the convent also meant that Sor Juana could read and write about religion despite the barriers to formal education for women. O\u2019Donnell argues that Sor Juana was called a rare bird because although theology was only an acceptable pursuit for men in the Catholic Church, she actively studied religion. Sor Juana likely perceived wisdom and religion as inseparable, so she probably also believed that to follow God was to pursue wisdom. Other scholars, like Alicia Gaspar de Alba, offer instead the possibility that Sor Juana was located on the lesbian continuum and that the convent was a place where having relations with other women was socially acceptable. A fourth perspective suggests that considering the colonial context of New Spain and Sor Juana's background as a criolla, she represented colonial knowledge in a way that defied colonial religious structures.Luis Felipe Fabre criticized 'Sorjuanista' scholarship as a whole, arguing that the discourse is binary rather than complex and multilayered.\n\n\n==== Octavio Paz ====\nOctavio Paz is a Nobel Prize laureate and scholar. In the 1989 book, Sor Juana: Or, The Traps of Faith (translated from Spanish to English by Margaret Sayers Peden), Paz examines and contemplates Sor Juana's poetry and life in the context of the history of New Spain, particularly focusing on the difficulties women then faced while trying to thrive in academic and artistic fields. Primarily, Paz aims to explain why Sor Juana chose to become a nun. In Juana Ram\u00edrez, Octavio Paz and Diane Marting find that Sor Juana's decision to become a nun stemmed from her refusal to marry; joining the convent, according to Paz and Marting, was a way for Juana to obtain authority and freedom without marrying.In his analyses of Sor Juana's poetry, Octavio Paz traces some of her influences to the Spanish writers of the Golden Age and the Hermetic tradition, mainly derived from the works of a noted Jesuit scholar of her era, Athanasius Kircher. Paz interprets Sor Juana's most ambitious and extensive poem, \"First Dream\" (\"Primero Sue\u00f1o\") as a representation of the desire of knowledge through a number of hermetic symbols, albeit transformed in her own language and skilled image-making abilities. In conclusion, Paz makes the case that Sor Juana's works were the most important body of poetic work produced in the Americas until the arrival of 19th-century figures such as Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman.\n\n\n=== Alicia Gaspar de Alba ===\nAlicia Gaspar de Alba's historical novel, Sor Juana's Second Dream (1999), rejects Paz's view that Sor Juana was ambivalent to sexuality, which he portrays as an explanation of her entering the convent. Instead, Gaspar de Alba interprets Sor Juana as homoerotic. It was Sor Juana's attraction to other women, which was repressed by the patriarchal and heteronormative society outside of the convent, that led her to become a nun. She criticizes Paz for his portrayal of what she calls Sorjuanistas, whom she claims stem from a Mexican, rather than Indigenous viewpoint, and are homophobic.This work won the Latino Literary Hall of Fame Award for Best Historical Novel in 2000. In 2001, it was translated into Spanish and published as El Segundo Sue\u00f1o by Grijalbo Mondadori. The novel has also been adapted to a stage play, The Nun and the Countess by Odalys Nanin; and to a film, Juana de Asbaje, directed by Mexican filmmaker Rene Bueno, with the screenplay co-written by Bueno and Gaspar de Alba and Mexican actress Ana de la Reguera as the title role. Juana, an opera based on the novel will be performed by Opera UCLA in November 2019, the music composed by Carla Lucero and the libretto co-written by Lucero and Gaspar de Alba.\n\n\n=== Luis Felipe Fabre ===\nLuis Felipe Fabre, a Mexican writer and scholar, ridicules other scholars, whom he collectively calls Sorjuanistas, who idolize Sor Juana. In his book, Sor Juana and Other Monsters, Fabre argues that the appropriation and recontextualization imminent in scholars' interpretations of Sor Juana construct Sor Juana as either a heretic or a lesbian. Fabre suggests that such representations constitute Sor Juana as a monstrosity or abnormality rather than as a complex woman. He suggests that rather than locating Sor Juana in a fixed identity, scholarship on Sor Juana should be a fluctuating and multilayered conversation.\n\n\n==== Margaret Sayers Peden ====\nMargaret Sayers Peden's 1982 A Woman of Genius: The Intellectual Autobiography of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, was the first English translation of Sor Juana's work. As well, Peden is credited for her 1989 translation of Sor Juana: Or, the Traps of Faith. Unlike other translations, Peden chose to translate the title of Sor Juana's best known work, First Dream, as First I dream instead. Peden's use of first person instills authority in Sor Juana as an author, as a person with knowledge, in a male-dominated society. Peden also published her English translations of Sor Juana's work in an anthology called Poems, Protest, and a Dream. This work includes her response to authorities censuring her, La Respuesta, and First Dream.\n\n\n==== Electa Arenal and Amanda Powell ====\nAn equally valuable feminist analysis and interpretation of Sor Juana's life and work is found in The Answer/La Respuesta by Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz by Electa Arenal, a Sor Juana scholar who is recognized among feminists who changed America, and Amanda Powell, a poet and translator. The original publication, released in 1994 by The Feminist Press, was re-released in an updated second edition in 2009, also by The Feminist Press. The bilingual publication includes poems, an annotated publication of Sor Juana's response to church officials and her impassioned plea for education of women, analysis and a bibliography. The Answer applies a valuable gender lens to Sor Juana's writings and life. In their feminist analysis, Powell and Arenal translate the viewpoint of Sor Juana's writing as gender-ambiguous. Released in an updated second edition in 2009, also by The Feminist Press, the bilingual publication includes poems, an annotated publication of Sor Juana's response to church officials and her impassioned plea for education of women, analysis and a bibliography.\n\n\n==== Theresa A. Yugar ====\nTheresa A. Yugar, a feminist theologian scholar in her own right, has written her Master's and Doctoral theses on Sor Juana. She wrote Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz: Feminist Reconstruction of Biography and Text, a book in which she discusses the life of Sor Juana through a feminist lens and analyzes her texts, La Respuesta (The Answer) and El Primero Sue\u00f1o (First Dream).Yugar aims to understand why individuals in Mexico in the twenty-first century have more knowledge of Frida Kahlo than Sor Juana. She celebrates poet Octavio Paz for crossing national borders with his internationally acclaimed work on Sor Juana: Or, The Traps of Faith. However, while Paz establishes Sor Juana's historical relevance, Yugar expands on his work to establish Sor Juana's importance in the twenty-first century.Yugar argues that Sor Juana is the first female bibliophile in the New World. She also argues that Sor Juana's historic focus on gender and class equality in education (the public sphere) and the household (the private sphere), in addition to her advocacy for language rights, and the connection between indigenous religious traditions and ecological protection were paramount in the seventeenth century. Today's similar advocacy ignores her primal position in that work which is currently exclusively associated with ecofeminism and feminist theology.\n\n\n== Historical influence ==\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\n\nThe Sor Juana In\u00e9s Services for Abused Women was established in 1993 to pay Sor Juana's dedication to helping women survivors of domestic violence forward. Renamed the Community Overcoming Relationship Abuse (CORA), the organization offers community, legal, and family support services in Spanish to Latina women and children who have faced or are facing domestic violence.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nThe San Jer\u00f3nimo Convent, where Juana lived the last 27 years of her life and where she wrote most of her work is today the University of the Cloister of Sor Juana in the historic center of Mexico City. The Mexican government founded in the university in 1979.\n\n\n=== Political Controversy ===\nWhile Sor Juana was a famous and controversial figure in the seventeenth century, she is also an important figure in modern times.\nDuring renovations at the cloister in the 1970s, bones believed to be those of Sor Juana were discovered. A medallion similar to the one depicted in portraits of Juana was also found. Margarita L\u00f3pez Portillo, the sister of President Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo (1976-1982), kept the medallion. During the tercentennial of Sor Juana's death in 1995, a member of the Mexican congress called on Margarita L\u00f3pez Portillo to return the medallion, which she said she had taken for safekeeping. She returned it to Congress on November 14, 1995, with the event and description of the controversy reported in The New York Times a month later. Whether or not the medallion belonged to Juana, the incident sparked discussions about Juana and abuse of official power in Mexico.\n\n\n=== Contribution to feminism ===\n\n\n==== Historic feminist movements ====\nAmanda Powell locates Sor Juana as a contributor to the Querelles des Femmes, a three-century long literary debate about women. Central to this early feminist debate were ideas about gender and sex, and, consequently, misogyny.Powell argues that the formal and informal networks and pro-feminist ideas of the Querelles des Femmes were important influences on Sor Juana's work, La Respuesta. For women, Powell argues, engaging in conversation with other women was as significant as communicating through writing. However, while Teresa of Avila appears in Sor Juana's La Respuesta, Sor Juana makes no mention of the person who launched the debate, Christine de Pizan. Rather than focusing on Sor Juana's engagement with other literary works, Powell prioritizes Sor Juana's position of authority in her own literary discourse. This authoritative stance not only demonstrates a direct counter to misogyny, but was also typically reserved for men. As well, Sor Juana's argument that ideas about women in religious hierarchies are culturally constructed, not divine, echoes ideas about the construction of gender and sex.\n\n\n==== Modern feminist movements ====\nYugar connects Sor Juana to feminist advocacy movements in the twenty-first century, such as religious feminism, ecofeminism, and the feminist movement in general. \nAlthough the current religious feminist movement grew out of the Liberation Theology movement of the 1970s, Yugar uses Sor Juana's criticism of religious law that permits only men to occupy leadership positions within the church as early evidence of her religious feminism. Based on Sor Juana's critique of the oppressive and patriarchal structures of the church of her day, Yugar argues that Sor Juana predated current movements, like Latina Feminist Theology, that privilege Latina women's views on religion. She also cites modern movements such as the Roman Catholic Women Priest Movement, the Women's Ordination Conference, and the Women's Alliance for Theology, Ethics and Ritual, all of which also speak out against the patriarchal limitations on women in religious institutions.Yugar emphasizes that Sor Juana interpreted the Bible as expressing concern with people of all backgrounds as well as with the earth. Most significantly, Yugar argues, Sor Juana expressed concern over the consequences of capitalistic Spanish domination over the earth. These ideas, Yugar points out, are commonly associated with modern feminist movements concerned with decolonization and the protection of the planet.Alicia Gaspar de Alba connects Sor Juana to the modern lesbian movement and Chicana movement. She links Sor Juana to criticizing the concepts of compulsory heterosexuality and advocating the idea of a lesbian continuum, both of which are credited to well-known feminist writer and advocate Adrienne Rich. As well, Gaspar de Alba locates Sor Juana in the Chicana movement, which has not been accepting of Indigenous lesbians.\n\n\n=== A symbol ===\n\n\n==== Colonial and indigenous identities ====\nAs a woman in religion, Sor Juana has become associated with the Virgin of Guadalupe, a religious symbol of Mexican identity, but was also connected to Aztec goddesses. For example, parts of Sor Juana's Villancico 224 are written in Nahuatl, while others are written in Spanish. The Virgin of Guadalupe is the subject of the Villancico, but depending on the language, the poem refers to both the Virgin of Guadalupe and Cihuacoatl, an Indigneous goddess. It is ambiguous whether Sor Juana prioritizes the Mexican or indigenous religious figure, or whether her focus is on harmonizing the two.Sor Juana's connection to indigenous religious figures is also prominent in her Loa to Divine Narcissus, (Spanish \"El Divino Narciso\") (see Jauregui 2003, 2009). The play centers on the interaction between two Indigenous people, named Occident and America, and two Spanish people, named Religion and Zeal. The characters exchange their religious perspectives, and conclude that there are more similarities between their religious traditions than there are differences. The loa references Aztec rituals and gods, including Huitzilopochtli, who symbolized the land of Mexico.Scholars like Nicole Gomez argue that Sor Juana's fusion of Spanish and Aztec religious traditions in her Loa to Divine Narcissus aims to raise the status of indigenous religious traditions to that of Catholicism in New Spain. Gomez argues that Sor Juana also emphasizes the violence with which Spanish religious traditions dominated indigenous ones. Ultimately, Gomez argues that Sor Juana's use of both colonial and indigenous languages, symbols, and religious traditions not only gives voice to indigenous peoples, who were marginalized, but also affirms her own indigenous identity.Through their scholarly interpretations of Sor Juana's work, Octavio Paz and Alicia Gaspar de Alba have also incorporated Sor Juana into discourses about Mexican identity. Paz's accredited scholarship on Sor Juana elevated her to a national symbol as a Mexican woman, writer, and religious authority. On the contrary, Gaspar de Alba emphasized Sor Juana's indigenous identity by inserting her into Chicana discourses.\n\n\n==== Connection to Frida Kahlo ====\nPaul Allatson emphasizes that women like Sor Juana and Frida Kahlo masculinized their appearances to symbolically complicate the space marked for women in society. Sor Juana's decision to cut her hair as punishment for mistakes she made during learning signified her own autonomy, but was also a way to engage in the masculinity expected of male-dominated spaces, like universities. According to Paul Allatson, nuns were also required to cut their hair after entering the convent. These ideas, Allatson suggests, are echoed in Frida Kahlo's 1940 self-portrait titled Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair, or Autorretrato con cabellos corto.As well, the University of the Cloister of Sor Juana honored both Frida Kahlo and Sor Juana on October 31, 2018 with a symbolic altar. The altar, called Las Dos Juanas, was specially made for the Day of the Dead.\n\n\n==== Official recognition by the Mexican government ====\nIn present times, Sor Juana is still an important figure in Mexico. \nIn 1995, Sor Juana's name was inscribed in gold on the wall of honor in the Mexican Congress in April 1995. In addition, Sor Juana is pictured on the obverse of the 200 pesos bill issued by the Banco de Mexico, and the 1000 pesos coin minted by Mexico between 1988 and 1992. The town where Sor Juana grew up, San Miguel Nepantla in the municipality of Tepetlixpa, State of Mexico, was renamed in her honor as Nepantla de Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz.\n\n\n=== Inspiration and influence ===\n\nSor Juana has been the inspiration for film makers and authors of poetry, plays, opera, and literary fiction.\n\nAmerican composer John Adams and director Peter Sellars used two of Sor Juana's poems, Pues mi Dios ha nacido a penar and Pues est\u00e1 tiritando in their libretto for the Nativity oratorio-opera El Ni\u00f1o (2000).\nThe Spanish-language miniseries Juana In\u00e9s (2016) by Canal Once TV, starring Arantza Ruiz and Arcelia Ram\u00edrez as Sor Juana, dramatizes her life.\nMar\u00eda Luisa Bemberg wrote and directed the 1990 film Yo, la peor de todas (I, the Worst of All), based on Octavo Paz's Sor Juana: Or, the Traps of Faith based on Sor Juana's life.\nA telenovela about her life, Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, was created in 1962.\nDiane Ackerman wrote a dramatic verse play, Reverse Thunder, about Sor Juana (1992).\nJesusa Rodr\u00edguez has produced a number of works concerning Sor Juana, including Sor Juana en Almoloya and Striptease de Sor Juana, based on Juana's poem, \"Primero Sue\u00f1o\".\nCanadian novelist Paul Anderson devoted 12 years writing a 1300-page novel entitled Hunger's Brides (pub. 2004) on Sor Juana. His novel won the 2005 Alberta Book Award.\nComposer Allison Sniffin's original composition, \u00d3yeme con los ojos \u2013 (Hear Me with Your Eyes: Sor Juana on the Nature of Love), based on text and poetry by Sor Juana, was commissioned by Melodia Women's Choir, which premiered the work at the Kaufman Center in New York City.\nHelen Edmundson's play The Heresy of Love, based on the life of Sor Juana, was premiered by the Royal Shakespeare Company in early 2012 and revived by Shakespeare's Globe in 2015.\nComposer Daniel Crozier and librettist Peter M. Krask wrote With Blood, With Ink, an opera based around her life, while both were students at Baltimore's Peabody Institute in 1993. The work was premiered at Peabody and won first prize in the National Operatic and Dramatic Association's Chamber Opera Competition. In May 2000, excerpts from the opera were included in the New York City Opera's Showcasing American Composers Series. The work in its entirety was premiered by the Fort Worth Opera on April 20, 2014 and recorded by Albany Records.\nPuerto Rican singer iLe recites part of one of Sor Juana's sonnets in her song \"Rescatarme\".\nPlaywright, director, dramaturg, teacher, and producer Kenneth Prestininzi wrote Impure Thoughts (Without Apology) which follows Sor Juana's experience with Bishop Francisco Aguilar y Seijas. \"[2]\".\nCanadian poet and novelist Margaret Atwood's 2007 book of poems The Door includes a poem entitled \"Sor Juana Works in the Garden\".\nOn 12 November 2017, Google Doodle commemorated her 366th birthday.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThe Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz Project Dartmouth College.

          "My wife and I were here and we only participated in the ATV activity but we had a great time.  They were pretty organized considering the large number of people there and all the different things do. Next time we are in Cabo, we will definitely be back to do other activities as well.",
          "This place has a ton of great activities! The staff is very friendly and happy as they help you through the different events. We were pleasantly surprised at the attention to safety for their more risky events (we particularly did ATVs, \u2026",
          "Amazing experience. The staff was fun and entertaining. Great views and fun trails! Wish we had time for the Zip Line!",
          "I did UTVs run in desert canyon. Actual run was excellent, suspension bridge was awesome, but what I didn't like - too much waiting time. After I check in it took about 45-50 min until start driving. And when we came back at 14:30 shuttle to hotel was at 15:45. This is just my opinion.",
          "We did the UTV, great time. Views are very nice. Our guides were fun. The restaurant after the ride for lunch and cocktails was great too.",
          "Would give 0 stars if I could, Lamest UTV experience you could get, prepare to breathe dust and be herded around like children. Then made to wait for transportation so you can buy more of their goods. Total rip off go spend your money \u2026",

          "My son and I just went on the UTV adventure and by far this was the best excursion we have ever been on.  We had a filthy, dusty, fast, wild, and crazy time.  Our tour guides, Rafael, Miguel and Julio were enthusiastic, hilarious, and kind!  Thank you guys so much for a wonderful, and memorable time.  I can't wait to come back to Cabo!",

          "First time zip lining in tandems. Loved it. Quite a bit of walking between lines. Bring a water bottle. They provide water.  It\u2019s hot. The views are good. Great view of the sea at one run.  Staff very competent and committed to safety. Wildlife sanctuary is an added bonus.",
          "Staff was rude when I called.  Very touristy.  Don't forget they'll make you pay a park entrance fee on top of whatever it cost for your tour too.",
          "Negotiated a price 2 days in advance over the phone (Dec 24). Called back twice to ask for our confirmation email - the first time was told \u201cI was just going to send it\u201d; the second time I was told to check my spam folder, but I already had \u2026",

          "My first time ATVing. Must do it again. Very hard to drive too. Worth the experience! If you are a bit nervous get a double. Look into coupons before hand, very expensive on site. Expect an additional park fee $15p.p. and insurance hold or fee.",
          "We had an amazing time, Miguel & the ATV team were awesome! Jose & Lupe gave us a great horseback trail ride. The experience gave us great memories! Thanks Wild Canyon.",
          "I went Paddleboarding yesterday through Wild Canyon located on the beach in front of the Solaz hotel.   I rented one board for a reasonable price ($40/hour) and took my 8 year old daughter out with me.  I had two guides, Carlos and David, \u2026",
          "Excellent experience.  Very safe. Competent staff. About 40 minutes from the peer by van.",

          "I had some of the most fun I have ever had at this location. Would highly recommend.",
          "Great bang for your buck! For one price I got transportation, a locker, one activity, access to a mini zoo, access to a splash park and a quesadilla lunch with a margarita. The horseback ride was about an hour with two great tour guides \u2026",
          "It's in the middle of the desert, very hot. There are fees that we were unaware off ( vehicle insurance and admission) but they were ultimately waived for us ($80)\nVery fun! The staff is super helpful and attentive. The attractions are \u2026",

          "We had two issues that could have made for a very bad experience but in both instances the staff recovered the fumble and kept things moving smoothly. Can't keep bad things from happening everytime so the ability to recover earns these guys 5 stars all day! Muy Bueno!",
          "Great place for zip lining! The staff was wonderful and made me feel safe and secure.",
          "My wife and decided to sign up for the activity through our resort. A few things to know before you  go because the communications on what to expect are vague at best. \n1. You are in a van with others from various hotels prior to heading \u2026",
          "Trainers and staff were fun but made you feel safe. First time ziplining. Was still nervous but had a great time!",
          "My friends and I had a blast riding the ATV's. The only thing is we paid for the excursions from the hotel. They failed to mention after we paid $110 we had to pay an additional park entry fee of $15 and $25 for insurance.  All non \u2026",
          "The guides were amazing.  The best stop we had in Cabo by far.  We had a blast.   However they sell you photos then do not send you the photos you paid for.  They sent us another families photos.  Then sent us a partial of our photos \u2026",

          "Tremendous experience!!! Mario and Rafael were amazing guides! Highly recommend this place for an exciting experience.!",
          "The people were amazing, very friendly, very informative place. The zip line was excellent. But you weren't allowed to take pictures of things you did. Which I found very disappointing. Took me 67 years to be able to go on a zip-line and \u2026",
          "Picture purchase process was too complex but the ATV adventure was fun",
          "Prepare for a good hike. Walking shoes greatly recommended. 8 Zip lines that take approximately 1.5 hours to complete. But a challenge I highly recommend for thrill seekers.",
          "Ziplining is very fun, uses a different system then most places so you'll want to pay attention during orientation. Loved the animal refuge! You get to hold birds and tortoises, feed them, and even kiss a macaw. Even got to pet a baby alligator. Definitely worth checking out",
          "SO many rules! You\u2019re not allowed to have your phone to take your own pictures. Despite trying to promote your own business, what about safety?  Being out of the country and stuck in the canyon or on the desert with no phone is horrible. Take away the thought of your business and what about safety.",
          "Absolutely fantastic! The staff were overwhelmingly kind, friendly, and helpful. The camel adventure and all the amenities along with it was amazing. I highly recommend this canyon oasis for people of all ages.",
          "I did the horseback ride. Very impressed by the layout, professionalism, and upkeep of the facility and the workers. Nothing second rate here. Great bird and reptile sanctuary, too. I could see the zip lines and 4x4 trails, very extensive, \u2026",
          "Great staff awesome experience julio UTV guide and crew was Great!!!! Must when visiting Cabo!!!!!! Great",

          "We had a blast! There was a bus that picked us up at the resort",
          "My wife and mother-in-law had a blast riding the UTV's.  The operation places your security as its priority, with briefings and personal protective equipment.  While I sat out the fun to watch our 4 year old son, I  observed the different \u2026",
          "What a great day with 8 zip lines, two of them really very long almost three-quarters of a mile to a mile each. Very competent staff, engaging, smart, capable! Had so much fun and so did everyone else in my group. It was a very personalized zip lining experience as well as a lot of fun.",
          "Had a great time but be prepared to do a little uphill climbing. Staff was great and zipline was very satisfying.",
          "Beautiful surroundings and some of the best, fastest zip-lines I've ever enjoyed! Be prepared to hike and drink lots of water. Tons of fun but not ideal on a warm day. Warm becomes hot really quickly. No knock on the business at all though, the people and the place were great!",

          "The best time of my life. Daniel our tour guide was superb and very knowledgeable. Can not wait to come back again.",
          "One of the best experiences ever. The staff is great and helpful. I did the ATV's, ziplines, and bungee jump. They were all ran great. The only minor complaint I have is that they don't advertise how rigorous the walking is on the zipline tour. But it is definitely a must-do while in Cabo.",
          "Fabulous wild and crazy adventures. Great staff.",
          "Loads of ziplining fun. Beware of temperatures.  Gets HOT in the canyon.",
          "Great zip line excursion. Staff was very friendly. Be prepared to hike a bit. 8 lines, but you had to climb stairs up a mountain to reach the next zip line. Great if you're in shape, but not so much if you haven't seen the inside of a gym in a while...lol. Overall it was a great experience.",
          "we had a great time, Zip line, ATV",
          "My family and I did the camel quest on 7/8/18. Brandon was the best guide ever. He was very informative and delightful. He went out of his way to get my 6 yr old son a turban for his pictures despite the crunch for time. He works very hard, \u2026",

          "The zip lines and guides are great!  Great zip lines, long and fast and some good views.  There are 7 different lines and you get to ride a total of 8 times (ride 3 & 6 are the same line which is fine as it is one of the longest and best \u2026",

        "wiki": "Mazatl\u00e1n (Spanish pronunciation: [masa\u02c8tlan] (listen)) is a city in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipio, known as the Mazatl\u00e1n Municipality. It is located at 23\u00b013\u2032N 106\u00b025\u2032W on the Pacific coast, across from the southernmost tip of the Baja California Peninsula.\nMazatl\u00e1n is a Nahuatl word meaning \"place of deer.\" The city was founded in 1531 by an army of Spaniards and indigenous settlers. By the mid-19th century, a large group of immigrants arrived from Germany. Together with the hard work of the Natives, they were able to develop Mazatl\u00e1n into a thriving commercial seaport, importing equipment for the nearby gold and silver mines. It served as the capital of Sinaloa from 1859 to 1873. The German settlers also influenced the local music, banda, with some genres being an alteration of Bavarian folk music. The settlers also established the Pacifico Brewery on March 14, 1900.\nWith a population of 438,434 (city) and 489,987 (municipality) as of the 2010 census, Mazatl\u00e1n is the second-largest city in the state. It is also a popular tourist destination, with its beaches lined with resort hotels. A car ferry crosses the Gulf of California, from Mazatl\u00e1n to La Paz, Baja California Sur. The municipality has a land area of 3,068.48 km\u00b2 (1,184.75 sq mi) and includes smaller outlying communities such as Villa Uni\u00f3n, La Noria, El Quelite, and El Habal. Mazatl\u00e1n is served by General Rafael Buelna International Airport.\nMazatl\u00e1n is also known for being the hometown and center of Banda sinaloense, a musical genre which began to develop in the XIX century and is now one of the most popular music genres in Mexico.Mazatl\u00e1n has a rich culture and art community. In addition to the Angela Peralta Theater, which has many wonderful performances for non-Spanish speakers, Mazatl\u00e1n has many galleries and artist's studios. Not to mention the very active Museo del Arte, exhibiting both Mexican and international artists.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Mazatl\u00e1n early settlers ===\nAccording to historians, Indigenous groups were in the region of Mazatl\u00e1n prior to the arrival of the Spanish. These groups included the Totorames, who lived from the south bank of the River Piaxtla, to the R\u00edo de las Ca\u00f1as, as well as the Xiximes, who lived in the mountains in the bordering state of Durango.\nUntil the early 19th century, Mazatl\u00e1n was a collection of huts inhabited by indigenous people whose major occupation was fishing, according to Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars, a French explorer. In 1829, a Filipino banker named Juan Nepomuceno Machado arrived and established commercial relations with vessels coming to Mazatl\u00e1n from far off places such as Chile, Peru, the United States, Europe, and Asia Pacific. By 1836, the city had a population of between 4,000 and 5,000.\n\n\n=== Foundation of the city, colonial period ===\nDuring the early years of the Spanish conquest in Sinaloa, the region currently occupied by the municipality of Mazatl\u00e1n remained uninhabited. The nearest town was Chametla, which was occupied by the Spanish in 1531, and lent its name to the province, despite being abandoned shortly afterward.\nIn 1534, the Valley of Mazatl\u00e1n was divided into 25 Castellanos by an unknown person who did not stay for long. In 1576, Don Hernando de Baz\u00e1n, Governor and Captain General of Nueva Vizcaya, sent Captain Martin Hernandez with his father, brothers, and soldiers to occupy the site of Mazatl\u00e1n, granting them land and titles in return. The Captain's claims were ratified in the City of Durango in 1639, and endorsed in the same city in 1650.\nNu\u00f1o de Guzman's entry to Sinaloa in 1531, and the appointment of the conquered lands as provinces, prompted the internal territorial division of the State. Chametla was occupied by the Spanish, and listed the province extending from the Rio Ca\u00f1as Elota to the boundary with the province of Culiacan. Both provinces belonged to the kingdom of New Galicia.\nIn 1565, the town of Chametla was gradually diminished by ongoing Indian raids. That year, Captain Francisco de Ibarra recovered the territory south of the state, rebuilt Chametla, and founded the Villa de San Sebasti\u00e1n (known today as Concordia), and awarded the region to New Vizcaya. The provinces under his jurisdiction included the villages of San Sebasti\u00e1n, Mazatl\u00e1n and its port, Charcas Copala Royals, and Finance Panuco.\nDuring the last years of the seventeenth century and early eighteenth century, the territory within Sinaloa remained unchanged, until 1732, when the provinces of Sonora and Ostimuri were united, as were the provinces of Sinaloa, Culiacan, and Rosario, with San Felipe and Santiago being the principal cities.\nIn 1749, Sinaloa was divided into five provinces with their mayors and lieutenancy: Maloya, with jurisdiction over Chametla, Rosario, and San Jose; Copala, with jurisdiction over San Ignacio, Piaxtla, and Mazatl\u00e1n; Culiac\u00e1n, with jurisdiction over Badiraguato, and Sinaloa, which bordered the Mayor River.\nIn 1786, the intendant system was implemented due to the need to establish a provincial government. Arizpe Municipality was formed out of the territories of Sonora and Sinaloa. That year, the first mayor, Garrido Dur\u00e1n, established eleven subdelegations, eight of them in Sinaloa, with Mazatl\u00e1n being within the subdelegation of Copala, which was later called San Sebasti\u00e1n.\n\n\n=== Independent Mexico ===\nAmong the first decrees that the legislature enacted was that the addition of each of the eleven districts, and this union, corresponding to the Union Villa Mariano Balleza, be given the name of one of the leading insurgents, parish priest Dolores Hidalgo, on the night of September 15, 1810.\nIn 1813, the Cadiz constitution came into effect. Article 310 of that constitution provided for the installation of local councils in towns that had more than 1,000 inhabitants. In 1814, Fernando VII repealed that constitution but it was later reinstated in 1820, and the first municipalities in Sinaloa were founded.\nIn the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, Mazatl\u00e1n was a native fishing village located north of Cerro de la Aduana. In 1821, it was declared the first port of Mazatl\u00e1n on Mexico's Pacific coast.\nJurisdictionally, Mazatl\u00e1n remained dependent on the sub-delegation of San Sebastian, unaffected by the divisions between the states of Sonora and Sinaloa. In 1824, they got together to form the Western State. After the imposition of new internal divisions of five departments and municipalities divided into parties, Mazatl\u00e1n was in the department of San Sebastian, which was formed with the parties of its name, San Ignacio and the Rosary, and it extended to the River of Reeds.\nIn 1830, the Western State was divided into two states. The first constitution of the state of Sinaloa, promulgated on December 12, 1831, divided the territory into eleven districts with their respective parties, leaving the district town of La Union separated from Concord and San Ignacio.\n\nAccording to the French navigator Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars, a Spanish banker named Machado, through his commercial activities, gave impetus to the village of Mazatl\u00e1n in 1836, then a village of four to five thousand people. It subsequently became the largest port on the Mexican Pacific coast.\nIn 1846 during the Mexican-American war, Mazatl\u00e1n was invaded and occupied by the U.S. military as part of the U.S. Pacific Coast campaign. In 1859, the port was blockaded by Captain Sidney Grenfell of the British steamship H.M.S. Amethyst.  On November 13, 1864, the French Army and the Imperialist forces took possession of Mazatl\u00e1n, until they were deported on November 13, 1866 by General Ram\u00f3n Corona's forces. After customs officials seized twenty-three ounces of gold from the British warship Chanticleer on June 18, 1868, which at the time was blockading the port, its captain, William H. Bridge, threatened to bomb the city on November 22.\nDuring the California Gold Rush, fortune hunters from the United States' East Coast sailed from New York Harbor and other Atlantic ports to Mexican ports in the Gulf of Mexico. After landing, the aspiring miners travelled over land for weeks to Mazatl\u00e1n, where they would embark from the port to arrive in San Francisco in another four to five weeks.\nWhen F\u00e9lix Zuloaga Tacubaya proclaimed the Plan of Ignoring the Constitution of 1857, the garrison of the Plaza de Mazatl\u00e1n did not remain outside this proclamation, and on the first of January, 1858, the Plan of Mazatl\u00e1n was proclaimed, which followed Zuloaga's Plan.\nThe capital of Sinaloa, until the year 1853, had been Culiac\u00e1n. However that year, the capital was transferred to Mazatl\u00e1n. On July 22, 1867, the federal government passed a law that forbade state capitals to also act as ports. As a result of this law, on September 20, 1873, the State Legislature decreed that Culiac\u00e1n would be the state capital again.\nThe Siglo XIX constitution of 1852 decreed a new internal division in Sinaloa, which reduced it to nine districts by removing San Ignacio, which had been annexed to the Cosal\u00e1, and Choix, which had been annexed to El Fuerte. It also amended the name of the district from Villa de la Union to the port of Mazatl\u00e1n. That same constitution also decreed the headquarters and council facility policies in each district.\nIn 1861, the political headquarters were removed and turned into prefectures, and the same year the State Legislature adopted the Act on Municipalities. In 1868, the district had five municipalities in Mazatl\u00e1n; one in the center and the other four in Villa Union, Siqueiros, La Noria, and The Milkweed.\nOn the morning of November 13, 1864, French Navy ships fired twelve cannon shots into the city, causing minor damage to several homes, but not causing any deaths. The attack stopped when the prefect of the city made known to the invaders that the Mexican Army had left the square and the city was formally ceded to the French.\nThe Mazatl\u00e1n Times was a weekly published by the American A. D. Jones. The first issue appeared on May 12, 1863. The publisher boasted that his was the only weekly English-language newspaper, not only in Mazatl\u00e1n and Sinaloa, but throughout Mexico.\nIn 1873, according to the census of the State, the District of Mazatl\u00e1n was reduced to three municipalities: Mazatl\u00e1n, Villa Union, and La Noria. Siqueiros had been annexed in 1870 to the central municipality, and The Milkweed to La Noria.\n\n\n==== Porfiriato ====\n\nMazatl\u00e1n's lighthouse (El Faro) began operating in mid-1879. The maritime signals were manufactured in Paris, France, containing a large oil lamp with mirrors, and a Fresnel lens to focus the light. Since the light was static, from a distance it was often mistaken for a star. By 1905, this lamp was converted to a revolving lamp. During that period, the Mazatl\u00e1n lighthouse was considered to be the naturally highest in the world. Today, the 1000 watt bulb can be seen for 30 nautical miles (60 km). Near the lighthouse shore, famous \"divers\" (called this even by the Spanish-speaking inhabitants of Mazatl\u00e1n) perform daring jumps off high rocks into the Pacific Ocean, for tips from onlooking tourists.\nOn June 26, 1880, Jesus Ramirez, former general in command of 400 men, stormed the garrison of the square and appropriated Mazatl\u00e1n. The city was subsequently bombed again by the Mexican warship the Democratic, which, during its attack, killed and wounded a high number of women and children. Of the 24 cannon shots fired, only three hit the army headquarters, and the rest landed on neighboring houses.\nAngela Peralta (1845\u20131883), a Mexican opera diva famed throughout the world, died of yellow fever in Mazatl\u00e1n shortly after her arrival in the port. Legend has it that she sang one last aria from her hotel balcony overlooking the Plazuela Machado. Her memory is held dear by Mazatlecos to this day, and the restored Angela Peralta Theater by the Plazuela keeps her memory alive.\nThe Cerveceria del Pac\u00edfico was founded in the city in 1900 by German immigrants.\n\n\n==== Mexican Revolution ====\n\nIn 1912, the municipalities enacted law No.21 as a form of internal division of the State. However, it wasn't until 1915 that the law was abolished by the political directorate, when it erected the first free communes.\nWith the publication of the decree creating the municipality of Mazatl\u00e1n in the official newspaper on April 8, 1915, independent life began in the region. The Constitution of 1917, culminating in the first constitutional governor, General Ram\u00f3n F. Iturbe, born in Mazatl\u00e1n, confirmed the sixteen municipalities into which the state was divided, which would then be subdivided into receiverships and police precincts.\nThe City of Mazatl\u00e1n has the dubious distinction of being the second city in the world after Tripoli, Libya, to suffer aerial bombardment (although the local historical display at the plazuela claims that Mazatl\u00e1n was the first). During the Mexican Revolution, General Venustiano Carranza (later president), intent on taking the city of Mazatl\u00e1n, ordered a biplane to drop a crude bomb of nails and dynamite wrapped in leather on the target of Neveria Hill adjacent to the downtown area of Mazatl\u00e1n. The crude bomb landed off target on the city streets of Mazatl\u00e1n, killing two citizens and wounding several others.\n\n\n==== Modern ====\n\nMazatl\u00e1n is also the hometown of Pedro Infante, one of the most popular actors and singers of the Cinema of Mexico's golden years.\nMazatl\u00e1n was well regarded by film stars such as John Wayne, Gary Cooper, John Huston, and others of their generation as a sportfishing mecca. The hotels along Olas Altas flourished during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, supporting this vibrant trade.\nIn the 1970s, tourism in Old Mazatl\u00e1n declined as newer venues catering to Western tourists opened on the expanses of beach to the north of the city (\"Zona Dorada\"). As an example of Mazatl\u00e1n's tourism expansion, one of the largest timeshare providers in Mexico, Grupo Vidanta, was founded in 1975 with the inauguration of Para\u00edso Mazatl\u00e1n (Mazatl\u00e1n Paradise). This time also saw the expansion of the Hotel Playa Mazatl\u00e1n, and the construction of many others, a trend that continues to this day.\nNext to Infante, Lorena Herrera, one of the most famous actresses and singers in Mexico and Latin America during the final decades of the 20th Century and the first decades of the 21st century, is Mazatl\u00e1n's most famous native. German-born telenovela star Sabine Moussier, a stablemate of Herrera's\u2014both have been under Televisa contract since the 1990s\u2014also grew up in Mazatl\u00e1n. Hollywood and Broadway actress Sara Ramirez is also a Mazatl\u00e1n native.\nAs the 21st century began, the Centro Hist\u00f3rico was rediscovered by newcomers and locals alike, spurring a renaissance of restoration and entrepreneurial endeavors. Once-fine homes that had fallen into literal ruin were restored to their former glory as family homes and boutique businesses. The city has assisted by upgrading infrastructure such as better water, sewer, and electrical services.\n\n\n== Neighboring communities ==\nThe town of Mazatl\u00e1n is organized territorially into nine syndicates:\nMazatl\u00e1n: Municipal capital, largest and most important tourist destination.\nVilla Union: Located 25 km from Mazatl\u00e1n, second most important town of the municipality. It is said that the first settlers belonged to a Spanish family who arrived there in 1576. Among its economic activities are fishing, agriculture, livestock, fruit growing, aquaculture, and brick making.El Recodo: So-called for the square shape of the Rio Presidio at this point. It is the cradle of Don Cruz Lizarraga, founder of the international Banda El Recodo. Its economic activities are livestock, agriculture, fruit growing, tanning, and saddlery.El Quelite: A picturesque and attractive tourist town located 38 km northwest of Mazatl\u00e1n. The El Quelite River passes through it. Its houses contain the Spanish classical influence predominant in the eighteenth century. Charrer\u00eda is practiced here, as is the Prehispanic game called Ulama. The main economic activities are: livestock, agriculture, farming and fruit growing.M\u00e1rmol de Salcido: This town is 32 km from Mazatl\u00e1n. It was an important cement and line production center. Its current economic activity is the production of chilies, fodder, and tomatoes; its coast has a large number of pristine beaches.El Roble: Founded in 1867, it is 32 km from Mazatl\u00e1n. It became the largest sugar mill in the south of the state. Its main economic activities are agriculture and the production of cheese and honey.Siqueiros: Originally called Penitas, it then adopted the name of San Jos\u00e9 de Siqueiros, in honor of the patron saint of the town, and the name of its founder. Founded in 1749, it is located 29 km from Mazatl\u00e1n on the Presidio River. Among its economic activities are agriculture, livestock, and vegetables.La Noria: Located 35 km northwest of Mazatl\u00e1n, its first settlers date from the late sixteenth century. Among its economic activities are livestock, agriculture, and saddlery. It is close to Presa Picachos. A few miles away is the famous Vinata de Los Osuna, a major producer of blue agave, belonging to the family of the same name.El Habal: A village located 10 km north of Mazatl\u00e1n. Its inhabitants are engaged in animal husbandry, farming, and fruit growing.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe town of Mazatl\u00e1n is located in the southern part of the State of Sinaloa, between the meridians 105 \u00b0 56'55 \" and 106 \u00b0 37'10\", west of Greenwich and between parallels 23 \u00b0 04'25 \" and 23 \u00b0 50'22 \" north latitude. It is 10 m above sea level.\nIts land area amounts to 3068.48 square kilometers, i.e. 5.3% of the total area of the State of Sinaloa, therefore it is classified as the ninth largest municipality.\nBordered on the north by the municipality of San Ignacio and the state of Durango, south by the town of Rosario and the Pacific Ocean, on the east by the town of Concordia and west by the Pacific Ocean's coast.\n\n\n=== Edaphology ===\nThere are two types of soil that have formed here: The first type, podzolic, is characterized by a strongly white river skyline with an outer shell on a bed of brown organic detritus; these soils have a spodic horizon as a principal basis, which is classified into 5 classes: a) Smoke-ferric podzol, b) humic, c) placid, d) ferric, and e) gleyic.\nThe smoke-ferrous are identified by a percentage ratio between free iron and carbon of 6 or less over 6 respectively; humic are grouped by a dispersed organic matter and aluminum; the placid defined by a thin \"bread\" iron at or above the horizon.\nThe Spodic sometimes have characteristics that indicate saturation with water at a certain time of the year. Ferric soil, as its name suggests, consists mostly of iron; in the gleyic podzol, besides the spodic horizon that occurs in it, you see a picture of gley, which appears particularly saturated with water at a certain time of year.\nThe latter are lateritic soils, which are located on the southeast side of town, where the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental reach the sea. These soils are typical of the rainy tropics, presenting small tiles of two types: (red and yellow), typical of temperate humid subtropical environments.\n\n\n=== Geomorphology ===\nThe orography is determined by the ramifications of the Sierra Madre Occidental on the northwestern coastal plain bearing towards the Pacific Ocean, where the hills rise towards Vigia, Punta de Mater\u00e9n, and the Monte chair. This orography, before entering the municipality of San Ignacio, takes the name of Sierra del Metate, whose characteristic is the formation of Peak Metate.\nAt the edge of Mazatl\u00e1n and Concordia runs the Sierra del Metate and Panuco. In this county, the Sierra Madre Occidental is diverted to penetrate Durango, leaving before some detachments, such as the Sierra de San Juan and the Friars, and constitutes, in of its topography, the following hilly areas:\nTo the north end of town one can see the Friars extending northwest, with elevations ranging from 150 to 1,900 meters above sea level. In the northwestern portion, El Quelite branches have elevations of 50\u2013700 meters above sea level. On the south-east and north sides, Arroyo de La Noria and some tributaries of the River El Quelite rise. The town of La Noria is located in this same part of the mountain, extending in a northwesterly direction at 300 and 500 meters above sea level. On its western side, the Zapote Brook begins. The Sierra de San Marcos is located in the north at 50 to 700 meters above sea level. Forming the southeastern and northwestern slopes are Brook Copala and some tributaries of the Presidio River.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nThe geological nature of the municipality, primarily made of sedimentary rock, gives rise to the outcrop of fragments of marine and consolidated rocks, and volcanic and metamorphic rocks. Mazatl\u00e1n generally consists of tonalite and monsonitas belonging to the Middle Tertiary: rhyodacites, rhyolites and ignimbrites with tuffaceous sediments at the base outcrops; andesitic rocks and felsitic late Early Cretaceous conglomerate, sandstone, tuff, sandy tuff \"tobal\u00edtica\", conglomeratic sandstone, arkose storm origins and late Tertiary rhyolitic tuffs, limestones, shales, sandstones and quartzites of coal, gravel and conglomerates that make alluvial fans and slope deposits; rhyolite and rhyodacite tuffs of the same composition, dacite and Lower Tertiary andecita medium; volcanic and pyroclastic spills of andecitic Cretaceous composition; plutonic rocks of basic composition and basic ultra late Paleozoic, Cretaceous limestones, conglomerates of igneous and metamorphic songs; sediments within the course of rivers and streams and sandy sediments, gravel, silt, and orange.\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\nEl Quelite River, and the Zapote, La Noria, and Los Cocos streams form part of the water resources of the municipality in the southwestern and southeastern slopes; these streams increase its volume considerably during the rainy season.\nThe current of the El Quelite River recorded a catchment of 835 square kilometers, where it drained annually for an average of 107 million cubic meters with variations ranging from 78 to 163 million cubic meters. This hydrological current passing through the town of Mazatl\u00e1n touches the towns of El Castillo, Las Juntas, Amapa, Los Naranjos, Milkweed, Modesto Station, and El Recreo. After traveling a distance of 100 kilometers from its source, it discharges into the Pacific Ocean. The El Zapote and Los Cocos streams drain in a southeasterly direction to end at the Presidio River, up to the villages from which they take their names.\nOn the southeast slope of the Sierra del Quelite is the De La Noria stream, and on the north side of it are some tributaries from the El Quelite River. The La Noria stream drains in a southeasterly direction of the town of the same name, and finally ends in the Presidio River.\nEl Zapote stream is formed on the western slope of the Sierra de La Noria, and moves in a southwesterly direction. In passing, it touches the towns of Zapote and El Recreo, and empties into the Pacific Ocean.\nOn the northern slopes of the Sierra del Salto, near the village of the same name in the state of Durango, the Presidio River moves southeastward and makes a journey of 167 kilometers. Its catchment area is 5,614 square kilometers, with an average annual expenditure of 900 million cubic meters, a maximum of 2,225 and a minimum of 550 million cubic meters. Populations on its banks are Los Cocos, El Zapote, El Placer, El Tecomate, Copala, El Recodo, Porras, Villa Uni\u00f3n, Alley Ostial, and Alley Rosa.\n\n\n=== Coast ===\n\nThe coasts of the municipality extend over 80 kilometers, and sandy beach sediments are formed in the northwestern flank of the head of the municipality. There is a substance classified as berms, which is a soft sediment formation. The coast consists of gravel and conglomerates that form alluvial fans and slope deposits.\nIn the southwestern corner, Huizache Lagoon occupies an area of 4,000 hectares 40.0 square miles). It receives the maritime influence through the Ostial estuary and freshwater diversion channel, and receives water from the Presidio River. It received water from USA also.\nThe coastline of the municipality is lined with shrimp and small-scale flake fishing vessels.\nCooperatives are distributed in the estuaries of the Escopama, Salinitas, El Veintinueve, and Estero Uriah Huizache lagoon.\nMost of the islands of the municipality are formed by ignimbrites, rhyolitic tuffs and tuffaceous sandstones of altered and deformed light color.\nBird Island is located between the extreme equatorial coordinates of 106 \u00b0 28'34 \" west longitude and 23 \u00b0 15'25\" north latitude; its area is about 0.4 square kilometers, 1.1 kilometers long, and maximum and minimum range of 800\u2013650 meters respectively.\nDeer Island is located between 106 \u00b0 27'60 \" west longitude and 23 \u00b0 14'03\" north latitude; its approximate length is 1.850 meters, and its width varies between 250 and 700 meters.\nCreston Island is located on the western edge of the outer bay of Mazatl\u00e1n, and it has a length of 700 meters and a maximum width of 800 meters. To the northwest, about 3 miles away, small islands like \"Southern Brother\" and \"Northern Brother\" (the first with 46.3 meters in elevation) and Turtle Rock rise 1.5 meters above sea level at its highest ridge.\nGoats Island is similar to Creston's appearance; it has a height above sea level of a little over 50 meters.\nStone Island is the most important part of the municipal coastline; its size is the largest of all because it has 30 square kilometers, and is approximately 14.5 miles long by 2.5 wide. Despite its name, Stone Island is a peninsula that connects to the continent near the Mazatl\u00e1n International Airport.\n\n\n==== Climate ====\nMazatl\u00e1n has a tropical savanna climate bordering a hot semi-arid climate, with a marked and rather long dry season and an average annual temperature of 25 \u00b0C.\n\nNote that during the summer months, with the humidity factor, temperatures usually feel well above what the thermometer shows.\nDuring the period of 1940\u20131980, the municipality experienced an average annual 748 mm of precipitation, with a maximum of 215.4 mm in 24 hours, and 90.4 mm was observed in one hour. During the same period the average evaporation rate per year was 2146.80 mm; the prevailing winds are in a northwesterly direction at an average speed of 5.0 meters. Thermal sensation in summer is quite marked.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n\nThe flora of Mazatl\u00e1n are tabachines, eucalyptus, laurels, and poplars. Its fauna includes birds like ducks, herons, and pelicans. There are armadillos, raccoons, and a variety of marine species such as whales, dolphins, turtles, and fish. White-tailed deer is one of the main animals that characterizes Mazatl\u00e1n. Today, there are fewer animals and plants than before, due to the way humans have changed the ecosystem.\nMazatl\u00e1n has several protected areas, one of which is the Protection of Flora and Fauna Area (APFF). CACAXTLA Plateau is located between the towns of Mazatl\u00e1n and San Ignacio in the central part of the state of Sinaloa, and contains a portion of the coastal habitats of the state, and is the largest in Sinaloa. This wealth of habitats favors the presence of 66 species of flora and fauna listed in NOM-059-ECOL-2001 and CITES and 47.5% of endemism reported for Sinaloa, plus charismatic and commercially important species. At the same time, the protected area is home to a population of 7,964 inhabitants, whose livelihood depends entirely on the extraction of natural resources in this area. The relationship between nature and society in the APFF Cacaxtla Plateau is the focus of this program.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nMazatl\u00e1n etymologically comes from the Nahuatl language and means \"Land of deer\" (mazatl \"deer\" and Tlan: \"earth\" or \"place\").\nOriginally, the name Presidio of Mazatl\u00e1n was used for what is now called Villa Uni\u00f3n. The port of Mazatl\u00e1n served as a reference to arrive to Presidio by sea, and was called the Islands of Mazatl\u00e1n. By decree of the Estado de Occidente, on September 11, 1828, Presidio of Mazatl\u00e1n was renamed Villa of the Union. This freed the name Mazatl\u00e1n (land of deer), and since the port was known as Islas de Mazatl\u00e1n, the name was adopted.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nTourism and fishing are the main, legal industries in Mazatl\u00e1n which is the unofficial center of the narcotics trade in Mexico.  The city houses the main beach resorts, and has the second largest fishing fleet in Mexico. The most processed seafood products in the city are shrimp and tuna. The first Mazatl\u00e1n hotel with a restaurant inside was named Canton La Fonda, and became operational in 1850. It was owned by a Chinese immigrant, Luen-Sing, which called the establishment the Luen-Sing Hotel. In 1864, there were three hotels and three restaurants in Mazatl\u00e1n, with more opening in the late nineteenth century. Today, more than twenty miles of beaches are the main attraction, and the city contains a large number of hotels, restaurants, bars, and shops. The city is also home to the Pac\u00edfico brewery, a coffee factory, and two power plants.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Gastronomy ==\n\nMain dishes in Mazatl\u00e1n are heavily influenced by seafood. Food specialties include ceviches, cocktails, zarandeado fish, and aguachile. Other common and prominent foods are smoked marlin and tuna, chilorio, bearded tamales (made with shrimp), Governor tacos, fish crackers and Sinaloa-style grill-roasted chicken. \nThere is also a varierty of restaurants offering international cuisine such as Japanese, Italian and Chinese. Fast food, vegetarian, snacks, meats, and a variety of taquerias with their own specialty foods are also available.\nThe local cuisine offers a variety of fresh drinks such as horchata, barley, coconut, coconut horchata, Tejuino, wines and a range of beers, of which the best known is the local beer called Pac\u00edfico, which has its factory in the harbor. Another well-known drink in the region is a vanilla-flavored beverage called \"tonicol.\"\nTypical sweets include coconut candies, jamoncillos, and other candy made with coconut marshmallows from the region.\n\n\n== The Malec\u00f3n of Mazatl\u00e1n ==\nThe Malec\u00f3n (boardwalk) of Mazatl\u00e1n is to be considered one of the longest in the world. Its length is about 8.5 km along the Pacific coast. Along the Malec\u00f3n are high cliffs, monuments, gazebos, old buildings, hotels, etc.\nThe Malec\u00f3n of Mazatl\u00e1n is composed of a series of scenic roads with pedestrian space, whose name varies along the route by stage or time of construction; from south to north are the streets: \n\nCalz. Joel Montes Camarena: a small road that connects the lighthouse, which used to be an island, to the rest of the city.\nPaseo del Centenario: starting in the previous street and bordering the west at the lookout hill where cliffs are seen, it was built to commemorate the centennial of the Independence of Mexico.\nPaseo Olas Altas: the oldest section of the boardwalk, it was originally a dike to prevent flooding problems in the 1830s, then it became an embankment which was used as urban space, and eventually it became a recreational space. It was the first part of the city with street lighting, and includes the south side of icebox hill and lookout hill.\nPaseo Claussen: It was built for the centennial in 1910. It borders the icebox hill and ends at the bay of Puerto Viejo. It was named in honor of George Claussen, who was in command of the Mazatl\u00e1n Works Agency and promoted the centennial project.\nAvenida del Mar: This is the most representative and longest section of the boardwalk; it extends along the bay of Puerto Viejo and comprises just over half of all the boardwalk. The panoramic tour ends at the tip, which initiates the Golden Zone (the primary hotel zone), and the avenue changes names twice and continues for several kilometers parallel to the coastline, yet maintains some distance from the coastal hotels.\n\n\n== Mazatl\u00e1n Aquarium ==\nSince its opening on September 13, 1980, Mazatl\u00e1n Aquarium has been one of the most complete and best of its kind in Latin America, besides being the largest in Mexico. According to the institution, \"The primary objective is for the public to learn to respect the marine ecosystem that which we depend on, and we foster this through knowledge of marine species.\"\nIt is divided into two main areas, the Aquarium and Botanical Garden; together, they contain the following facilities:\nAquarium: \nSection 1: Marine Fish and Jellyfish.\nSection 2: Marine Fish and Dive Exhibition.\nSection 3: Freshwater Fish and Central Fishbowl: Fishbowl Sharks\n\nDiving -Exhibition Activity: Swimming with Sharks. 2 Shark Species, 2 Turtle Species, 50 different fish species, 2 Striped Rays, 1 Sparrowhawk.\nMuseum of the Sea: Temporary exhibitions and permanent displays that include shells, snails, and materials relating to the marine ecosystem.Botanical Garden: 1 hectare which consists of 75 tree species from around the world, and regional species of Sinaloa.\n\nPond Sea Lions: Sea Lions.\nFrog Pond: 21 aquaterrariums in which about 13 species and a total of approximately 120 organisms reside, including grass frogs, toads, green tree frogs, eagle rays, and giant Mazatleco toads.\nOceanic Fishbowl: A total of 50 species among which are lemon sharks, giant grouper fish, olive ridley, hawksbill, rays, snappers, butterfly fish, mackerel, and others.\nAviary: about 13 species of birds that inhabit the State of Sinaloa are displayed: peacocks, mallards, white pelicans, brown pelicans, quails, pichichin ducks, white wing doves, and others.\nCactus section\nCrocodiles\nowls\nsnakes\nlizards\nducks\nblack swans\nParrots\nostrich\ntiger\ncoyote\nfox\n\n\n== Mazatl\u00e1n Lighthouse ==\n\nThe Mazatl\u00e1n lighthouse, called El Faro Lighthouse,  is located at the peak of Cerro del Creston, at the southern end of the peninsular city of Mazatl\u00e1n. The lighthouse has the distinction of being settled in what was formerly an island, and has a length of 641 meters by 321 meters and a height of 157 meters, making it the highest natural lighthouse in the Americas, and one of the highest operating lighthouses in the world.\nIn 1821, the Cortes of Cadiz issued a decree certifying the City of Mazatl\u00e1n as the first port of height of the Mexican Pacific. This introduced Mazatl\u00e1n as a viable destination for international trade. The decree, along with the rapid growth of large mining and commercial consortia, led to an intensified level of ship traffic. In those days, it was not uncommon for over 60 ships from Europe and the Far East, loaded with different types of merchandise, to reach the port each year. After several days of travel and trading of supplies, these boats would depart Mazatl\u00e1n loaded with bars of gold and silver from the rich mines of the region.\nWhile the exponential amount of growth in boat traffic into and out of the port undoubtedly benefitted the region, it also presented a problem at night. At that time there was no way to indicate to boats in the dark where the marina was located, or how to enter and dock, making it hard for ships to be accurate, which often led to sailors endangering their boats.\nThe first use of the Isla de Creston as a lighted marine signal was in 1828. The light facilities, located on top of an imposing hill, were very modest, consisting of only a small stone structure on which fires, fueled by whale oil and wood, or coconut chips, were lit. The fires were fed wood and coal, allowing them to produce a dim light that could only be seen within walking distance, making it of little help to seafarers, especially in bad weather.\nEl Faro became the answer to the problem. First lit over the Pacific Ocean in 1879, the lighthouse's original lamp was constructed in Paris. It was made of an oil lamp surrounded by mirrors, and a Fresnel lens to focus the light. This allowed El Faro's light to be seen from a much further distance, and thus give better navigation services, leading to approaches made with greater precision.\nIn 1905, the lamp was converted to hydrogen gas, and was made to be able to revolve in a full circle. The final update of the light source came in 1933, when it was converted to electricity, which is what is still there today. In order to emit its powerful light, El Faro uses a 1,000 watt bulb, which is focused by a Fresnel lens.\nIt is now one of the top tourist attractions in the city of Mazatlan, and people can hike up to see it up close. The view from the lighthouse is also a big draw for visitors.\n\n\n== Banda Sinaloense ==\nBanda Sinaloense or Tambora is a type of musical ensemble, as well as a traditional and popular musical genre, which was established in the early twenties in the state of Sinaloa, in the northwestern region of Mexico. It originates in the European Fanfare style, however, like many other traditional Mexican ensembles, Banda Sinaloense groups perform a variety of musical forms, and their repertoire covers various traditional styles such as rancheras, corridos, polkas, waltzes, mazurkas, and chotis, all tailored to the sensitivity of the inhabitants of this Mexican region: music as well as popular romantic ballads such as Cumbia.\n\nThe unique sound of the Sinaloa band is very similar to German and French wind instrument bands, though there are differences in styles between north-central and southern parts of the state. In the north-central area, the musical phrasing is lighter and nuanced, more similar to Western European styles, and in the south, the style has a very strong phrasing and a little less nuanced performance, more influenced by the Bavarian German style. Several researchers,have located the origin of these styles to these regions, especially considering foreign interventions in the state and in Mazatl\u00e1n early in the century, which was inhabited mostly by German immigrants. However, the Swiss ethnomusicologist Helena Simonett explains that the first Sinaloense bands were formed by people who deserted the military and municipal bands, and went to live in mountain villages, adding credence to the Sinaloa founders with the rhythmic influence of Mayo-Yoreme, which have contributed to its essence. Nevertheless, there is an historic agreement which dates the musical influence before the Mazatl\u00e1n German trade boom (1870-1890), as it would lead not only to distribution of instruments through marketing, but also required a cultural disclosure that could only happen in a close relationship between the carriers of such traditions and the people of the region, and this circumstance only occurred in Mazatl\u00e1n. That is why the theory of French and Spanish influence on the German influence in other regions of Sinaloa is reinforced as the development of the music of the Sinaloan drum has records and previous history in distant places in the mountains of Sinaloa where there was no German influence. However, post-war French influence intervention and Spanish cultural remnants are present. There is also evidence of the formation of the first organological Mazatl\u00e1n clusters as well as other parts of Sinaloa, for example: La Banda El Recodo de Don. Cruz Lizarraga in 1938, which had a strong German influence in its playing style, and included stringed instruments, in contrast with La Banda Los Tacuichamona (1888), La Banda Los Sirolas Culiacan (1920) and The Band of Brothers Rubio (1929) Mocorito, which were exclusively wind instruments and percussion akin to the Galo-Ib\u00e9rico fanfare style.\n\n\n== Main beaches ==\nOlas Altas: the beach with greatest historical reference to Mazatl\u00e1n, it is located in the southern part of the city, a few meters from downtown. In the section of the boardwalk that passes through Olas Altas one can see various monuments such as The Shield, which contains the shields of Sinaloa and Mazatl\u00e1n; The Deer, a statue of a deer representing the etymology of the city's name; Monument to Pedro Infante; Monument to the Continuity of Life; Monument to Mazatleca Women, and also the famous restaurant \"Puerto Viejo\".\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nNorte Beach: It is located along the northwest edge of the commercial downtown district. Here one can find the Monument to Fishermen; the Monument to Pulmonias, and the Monument to the hometown Pacific Brewery. The second of these refers to the characteristic taxis of this city.\nS\u00e1balo Beach: the long stretch of beach along Camaron Sabalo and Malecon from the Fishermen's Monument to the marina jetty.\nCerritos Beach: It starts at the entrance to the \"new\" marina and the end of the Golden Zone (hotel district) and runs north to Cerritos point, a rocky landform just before the Emerald Bay resort.\nIsla de la Piedra Beach: A miles-long Located in the southern part of the city on the peninsula that is separated from the old city by the entrance to the main commercial harbor; only accessible by car and a long, dusty rough road from just off the airport access road, or, by small passenger ferries that provide regular service from the docks at the edge of the historic center.\n\n\n== Tourism and culture ==\n\n\n=== Historic Center ===\nThe Historic Center of Mazatl\u00e1n, among whose former inhabitants are French, German, Chinese, Italian, Spanish and Americans (many contemporary inhabitants of Mazatl\u00e1n are descended from these), was named Heritage of the Nation on March 12, 2001. A civil association composed of a group of Mazatl\u00e1n locals have managed to revive this area, along with the support of various organizations, companies, and government authorities. Among the buildings and areas of high cultural value are the Plazuela Machado, the Angela Peralta Theater, the old Hotel Iturbide (today the Municipal Arts Centre), Mansion of Redo, Melchers House, House of Retes, Corvera Building, Bank of London and Mexico Building, Haas House, Temple of San Jos\u00e9, and various others.\n\n\n=== Culture and art ===\nMazatl\u00e1n hosts several events annually, the most important being the International Carnival of Mazatl\u00e1n, which was 114 years old in 2012. Other important events are the Mazatl\u00e1n Cultural Festival and the Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n International Dance Festival, celebrated every year in the winter and spring, respectively. There is also the Book Fair and Arts of Mazatl\u00e1n (Feliart) and Mazatl\u00e1n Book Fair (FELIMAZ).Another important event is the International Motorcycle Week, which attracts thousands of motorcyclists from around the country as well as from abroad, and is held each year during Easter week.In sports, Mazatl\u00e1n is home to the Pacific International Triathlon held in April, and the Pacific International Marathon, which is held every year in late November and early December, and is attended by athletes from around the world.In 2012, Mazatl\u00e1n was chosen as the host city for the tenth installment of Premios Oye!, prizes awarded by the National Academy of Music in Mexico, and the Volleyball Olympic qualifiers for the Olympic Games in London 2012.\n\n\n=== Mazatl\u00e1n Carnival ===\n\nLate February/Early March. This is currently one of the most important carnivals in Mexico, since the first parade on Sunday brings together more than 600,000 people for over three hours in the coastal area of the city on the \"Avenida del Mar.\" A novelty that allows tourists to come from all over the world to witness this festival is called \"Burning of humor\" where tradition says to burn a character (Monigote) representing someone who people think has done a misdeed, which usually means politicians, presidents, or as in 2013, \"influenza\" was burned. Both of these have negatively affected the country's image in recent years. This is followed by the famous \"Naval Combat,\" depicting the battle that took place against French vessels seeking to land at the port.\nA very representative element of this carnival are the great \"Monigotes\" that are placed in important areas of the city as decorations. These are giant figures made of paper mache are supported by large structures. The central events of the carnival are the crowning of the queen of the carnival, and this is a massive event held with a selection of world-class artists.  Two parades are scheduled, one on Sunday and another on Mardi Gras (to close the celebration). Superbly decorated and colorful floats line a good part of the coastal walk, with an estimated several hundred thousand spectators in attendance. These include royal courts, ambassadors from around the country and abroad, special guests such as athletes, TV entertainers, and various showbusiness personalities, not to mention hundreds of Mazatlecos of all ages and social conditions.\nThe Mazatl\u00e1n Carnival is distinguished from other carnivals for its distinctive accompaniment by Banda Sinaloa music that has transcended the world through what is today called \"la onda grupera.\" Events includes cultural activities (poetry contests, literature prizes, and shows of enormous artistic quality), with which the party extends to all sectors of the population and covers a range of local and tourist tastes.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nBaseball is very popular among Mazatlecos. The representative team, called Venados de Mazatlan, is part of the Mexican Pacific League. The league's season begins in mid-October and ends in late December. Playoffs are in January of every year, and from the eight teams that make up the league, one becomes the representative of Mexico in the Caribbean Series.\nAnother sport that has been practiced for over 25 years is soccer, with major achievements both statewide and nationally. On June 2, 2020 it was announced that Liga MX club Monarcas Morelia would be relocating to a new state of the art football stadium in Mazatlan in time for the league's 2020-21 season, with rumors that the team would be renamed either Delfines de Mazatlan (Dolphins of Mazatlan) or Mazatl\u00e1n F.C..Mazatl\u00e1n is a major sporting center of the country, with important sporting activities such as the marathon and triathlon, in which not only local but also foreign athletes participate.\nOne of the initial cricket teams in Mazatl\u00e1n were the Mazatl\u00e1n Redskins. They now play American football, soccer, and volleyball.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe General Rafael Buelna International Airport (IATA Code: MZT) has daily domestic flights and international flights to the United States and Canada.\nBy land, Mazatl\u00e1n is connected to the north (Culiacan) and south (Tepic) and to Guadalajara via highway 15 and the corresponding Federal Highway 15D. To the east, it is connected to Durango by Highway 40 and the corresponding Federal Highway 40D.\nFerries make the daily journey to La Paz, Baja California Sur, while a varied number of cruise ships visit the port every week from the United States.\n\n\n=== Durango-Mazatl\u00e1n highway ===\nThe Durango-Mazatl\u00e1n highway is a highway that link the cities of Mazatl\u00e1n and Durango, crossing the Sierra Madre Occidental.\nWith an investment of over 28 billion pesos, the Durango-Mazatl\u00e1n highway is one of the boldest projects in Mexico.\nKey Features\n\n230 km in length\n63 tunnels\n115 bridges including the Baluarte Bridge\nTwo-lane and four-lane sections\nInitial estimated cost for the work was 3.5 billion pesos, with a final estimate of 28.6 billion pesos\nGenerating 4,500 direct jobs and 10,000 indirect jobs\nStretch of 7.7 km of 4 lanes (including the Baluarte Bridge)Main sections\n\n\"The Sinaloa\" tunnel, measuring 2,794 meters\nBaluarte bridge with a center span of 520 meters and a total length of 1,124 meters\nBridge ParlorsTime reduction of 6\u20138 hours to 3 hours.\nPulmonias are a popular form of transportation in Mazatl\u00e1n. This form of transportation was created in Mazatl\u00e1n. These golf cart-like taxis are a popular transportation option.\n\n\n== Political situation ==\nIn the municipality of Mazatl\u00e1n, there exist two electoral preferences. While the inhabitants of the receiverships, police stations, and other villages in the municipality continue voting traditionally for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, this phenomenon is changing within the city.\nMazatl\u00e1n has traditionally been governed by municipal leaders from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. During the municipal elections of 1989, Rice Humberto Garc\u00eda (1990-1992) won the municipal presidency as a candidate for the National Action Party (PAN). However, the Institutional Revolutionary Party regained the municipality during the elections of 1992, when Martin Gavica Gardu\u00f1o (1993-1995) won the leadership. Alejandro Camacho Mendoza reclaimed the municipality for his party, PAN, for the 1996-1998 period, and Alejandro Higuera Osuna held it for the 1999\u20132001 term.\nIn the 2002-2004 elections, both the National Action Party and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) were defeated by the Labour Party candidate, Jorge Alberto Rodriguez Pasos. However, a few months after taking the oath of mayor, Rodriguez Pasos was deposed by the State Congress after being charged for domestic violence, in which his own wife accused him. His place was taken by Gerardo Ramirez Rosete, from the same party. Shortly thereafter, in a move seen as a ruse of the PRI state government, he was replaced by Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Gonz\u00e1lez, a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party.\nIn the 2005-2007 elections, Alejandro Higuera Osuna from PAN won the municipal presidency and held it until June 2007, when he resigned to contest the election for local deputy; on the 12th of that month, he was replaced by Isaac Lopez Arregui.\nIn the 2008-2010 elections, the Institutional Revolutionary Party regained the town with its candidate Jorge Abel Lopez Sanchez.\nSince April 2010, the town of Mazatl\u00e1n has been ruled by both the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and National Action Party, since the last mayoral election was won by PRI member Jorge Abel Lopez Sanchez, who defeated a former PAN and Petetista government (PT). That was the last time that Mazatl\u00e1n has had a PRI government.\nIn July 2010, in the election for Governor, Local, and Municipal Presidents' Deputies, the first loss occurred for the PRI governor of Sinaloa. Mario L\u00f3pez Valdez, former Sinaloa Senator and member of the PRI, was defeated. This ended the PRI hegemony in the state of Sinaloa. Another important event was the third choice Alejandro Higuera Osuna from PAN, who won the municipal presidency of Mazatl\u00e1n. In addition, the PAN won a historic vote statewide.\n\n\n== Educational institutions ==\nFrench explorer Duflot de Mofras notes that by the 1840s, foreign traders based in Mazatl\u00e1n impelled the opening of the first public school in the city. Still, in 1872, there were only two primary schools. In 1873, the Liceo Rosales, which over time would become the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, was founded.\nCurrently in Mazatl\u00e1n there are preschools, elementary, middle, high schools, colleges, and faculties of both public and private institutions. Of those, the main ones are the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, Mazatl\u00e1n Institute of Technology, the University of the West, the Polytechnic University of Sinaloa and Nautical School of Mazatl\u00e1n. Of these universities, only the Autonomous University of Sinaloa is public. Those belonging to the private sector, in addition to those mentioned above, also include TecMilenio University, Autonomous University of Durango, and Sinaloa Superior Institute of Technology.\nThe National Autonomous University of Mexico, UNAM, has a presence in the city with an academic unit specializing in marine sciences and the Center for Food Research and Development.\n\n\n== Notable person ==\nPedro Infante, Actor and Singer.

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country. In the year 1964 was a bad year, and it lost the category, playing the next year in the second category, but returning afterwards.The Strongest : Founded in 1908 the club hosts some of its games and trains on their home stadium named Rafael Mendoza after Don Rafael Mendoza, one of the most important presidents of the club. In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts that allowed the team to rise again as one of the most important in the country.\n\nLa Paz F.C. : Founded in 1989, the club quickly rose through the ranks to become the third major club in the capital, only behind in popularity to the two well-established city rivals.The city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:\n\nAcademia de Balompi\u00e9 Boliviano\nAlways Ready\nChaco Petrolero\nClub 31 de Octubre\nDeportivo Municipal de La Paz\nFraternidad Tigres\nMariscal Braun\nUniversitario de La Paz\nClub Uni\u00f3n MaestranzaWith the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Uni\u00f3n Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the Estadio Hernando Siles, which also hosts the national football team and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times. The palace has been restored many times since, but the name has remained untouched.\n\n\n=== Principal attractions ===\n\n\n==== Museums and cultural centers ====\n\nThe former home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, martyr of the independence revolution of 1809, has been preserved and is now a museum.

In March 2012, more than 1.5 million vehicles were registered. Heavy traffic is common in the city center and traffic jams occur on peak hours.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\n\nThe La Paz-El Alto Highway is a toll road that connects the city of La Paz with the neighboring city of El Alto. It is the city's main highway. It allows easy access to El Alto International Airport. The highway runs 11,7 km and crosses the city of El Alto:\n\n Autopista La Paz-El Alto/RN-3 (La Paz-El Alto Highway) - Connects La Paz with El Alto.\n Autov\u00eda La Paz Oruro/A-1 (La Paz-Oruro Highway)  - Connects La Paz with the cities of Oruro, Patacamaya and Caracollo. It then connects with Ruta Nacional 1/RN-1 (National Highway 1) heading south to the cities of Potos\u00ed, Camargo, Tarija.The Southern District, one of La Paz's most affluent and commercial neighborhoods, is relatively separated from the rest of the city, including the CBD. The Avenida Costanera and Avenida Kantutani (Costanera and Kantutani Avenues) connect the southern district with the rest of the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nEl Alto International Airport (IATA code: LPB) is La Paz's national and international airport and a principal hub for L\u00ednea A\u00e9rea Amaszonas and Transporte A\u00e9reo Militar. It also serves as a focus city for Boliviana de Aviaci\u00f3n, Bolivia's flag-carrier and largest airline. The airport is located in the city of El Alto and is (13 km) south-west of La Paz's city center. At an elevation of 4,061 metres (13,323 feet), it is the highest international airport and fifth highest commercial airport in the world. The runway has a length of 4,000 metres (2.5 mi). It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport.\nInternational carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca, LATAM Airlines and Peruvian Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, Santiago and Cusco. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft.\nAirport facilities include ATMs, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, car rentals, duty-free shops, and free Wi-Fi internet. Additionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\n\n\n=== Cable car system ===\n\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\n\n\n== Communications and media ==\nThe postal service is run by ECOBOL (National Company) which has its headquarters in La Paz. There are other companies offering courier and transport logistics courier nationally and internationally.\nThe private telecommunications company 'Entel' is located in the city and provides telephony, Internet, cell phone, data and voice services. The telephone cooperative Cotel is responsible for managing much of their phones and now offers Internet services and cable television among others.\nArea Code: 2\nCountry Code: 591\nThe main daily newspapers in circulation are: P\u00e1gina Siete, La Razon, El Diario, La Prensa, Jornada and El Alte\u00f1o. Other papers of local importance are: Extra and Gente. There are also several other publications and weekly magazines.\nThere are 18 television channels with offices in La Paz. Channel 7 is state property. The main ones are: Unitel, ATB Bolivia, Red Uno, Bolivision, Red PAT. Channel 13 is managed by the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

        "wiki": "San Pedro Sula (Spanish pronunciation: [san \u02c8ped\u027eo \u02c8sula]) is the capital of Cort\u00e9s Department, Honduras. It is located in the northwest corner of the country in the Sula Valley, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Puerto Cort\u00e9s on the Caribbean Sea. With a population of 661,190 in the central urban area (2019 calculation) and a population of 1,445,598 in its metropolitan area in 2019, it is the nation's primary industrial center and second largest city after the capital Tegucigalpa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe city grew slowly from about 800 residents in 1590, to almost 10,000 by the 1890s, but most of this population growth took place in the nineteenth century.  It benefitted initially from the growth of bananas for export in the 1870s and 1880s and formed a close relationship with US-based shipper and railroad entrepreneur Samuel Zemurray's Cuyamel Fruit Company, and the construction of the Interoceanic Railroad between 1869 and 1874 which connected the city to the coast at Puerto Cort\u00e9s. Zemurray worked closely with local elites who invested in subsidiary enterprises and thus shaped the way politically for Cuyamel to establish himself and to pay very few taxes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\nIn 2013, fifteen years after the effects of Hurricane Mitch, Honduras is one of the poorest countries in Latin America; around San Pedro Sula, banana production has not fully recovered, and \"manufacturing has all but dried up.\" The problems are exacerbated by organized gangs, whose rules prevent residents from safely leaving gang-controlled neighborhoods such as Chamelec\u00f3n for jobs in other parts of town.In 2000, then-Mayor Roberto Larios Silva said \"San Pedro Sula is where the economic development of the country is concentrated via the city's industrial, commercial and financial development.\"  The then-manager of Hotel Copantl attributed its growth in business-related tourism ...[to] the maquila (apparel \nmanufacturing) industry.As of 2011, San Pedro Sula generated two-thirds of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n\n== Crime ==\nSan Pedro Sula was the \"murder capital of the world\" until early 2016 when Caracas, Venezuela, surpassed its homicide rate. Since the 2009 Honduran military coup \"unemployment and underemployment rates have doubled while the number of people living in extreme poverty has skyrocketed.\" In 2013, the city had 187 homicides per 100,000 residents. This surpassed Ciudad Juarez, Mexico's rate of 148 killings per 100,000, or an average of about three homicides per day; Ciudad Juarez had previously topped the list for three consecutive years. Both cities are major operational and strategic distribution points in the illegal drug trade, particularly to the United States, and have significant gang activity. In response, authorities launched Operation Lightning, saturating violence hotspots with police and soldiers. Meanwhile, arms trafficking has flooded the country, with just under 70% of all firearms being illegal. 83% of homicides in the city involve firearms.According to the Los Angeles Times, \"the homicide rate is stoked by the rivalry of the brutal street gangs, mostly descendants of gangs formed in Los Angeles and deported to Central America in the 1990s, including Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and the 18th Street gang. Their ranks are fed by the disastrous economy of Honduras, and emboldened more recently by alliances with Mexican drug traffickers moving cocaine through the country.\"Crime and economic stress have led to the migration of large numbers of unaccompanied minors to the US border. The latest data from the CBP shows San Pedro Sula as the major source for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) migrating from Honduras.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSan Pedro Sula features a dry-summer Tropical monsoon climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Am), with year-round relatively high temperatures and plentiful rainfall year-round. San Pedro Sula has experienced hurricanes and tropical storms and is prone to them during the hurricane season usually when the storms form in the southern part of the Caribbean or Western Africa.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nSan Pedro Sula, as most cities built under the Spanish colonial period, is divided in quadrants.\nAvenues in the city run from north to south and streets run from east to west. First Street and First Avenue mark the \"center of the city\" and effectively divide it into four major quadrants NW, NE, SW and SE.\n\n\n=== Southwest ===\nBarrio El Benque, the business district, is just to the west and south of the center, and other neighborhoods in the suroeste include Barrio Paz Barahona, Barrio La Guardia, Colonia Altamira, Colonia Mesetas, Barrio R\u00edo de Piedras, Barrio Suyapa (from 12 Avenida S out to Avenida Circunvalaci\u00f3n, from 7 Calle S to 10 Calles S), Colonia Hernandez, Barrio Prado Alto, and Colonia El Chamelec\u00f3n. The latter includes area from 23 Avenida S west to 27 Avenida S, from 1 Calle (named Bulevar Los Pr\u00f3ceres there) south to 5 Calle S0. To the south of Colonia El Chamelec\u00f3n are Colonia Dub\u00f3n, Colonia Figueroa, Colonia Trejo (from 10 Calle S to 12 Calle S, from about Avenida Circunvalaci\u00f3n to 25 Avenida S, including the Consulate of Nicaragua), Colonia Altamira, and Colonia Altiplano. Colonia Las Mesetas runs from 12 Calle S to 14 Calle S, from 21 Avenida A (S) to past 24 Avenida S.\n\n\n=== Northwest ===\nBarrio Guamilito is just to the west and north of the center. Noroeste neighborhoods include Colonia Moderna (from 1 Calle to 5 Calle NO, from Avendia Circunvalaci\u00f3n to the river beyond 24 Avenida), Colonia La Mora (from 5 Calle NO to 7 Calle NO, from Avendia Circunvalaci\u00f3n to the r\u00edo beyond 24 Avenida), Colonia Zeron, the Colonia Columbia by the Universidad de San Pedro Sula, Barrio La Cervecer\u00eda and Barrio Guadalupe.  Across the river along which 24 Avenida runs is Colonia Juan Lindo and Colonia Jardines Del Valle.From the river past 24 Avenida, north to 25 Calle and west to 12 Avenida, is Colonia Universidad. Universidad de San Pedro Sula is to its south, across the river.  West of Colonia Universidad is Colonia Country, a small neighborhood including the Academia Americana, and Colonia Villas del Sol, which runs from Boulevard Mackey west to include Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Honduras en el Valle de Sula, and goes north to R\u00edo Bermejo but does not cross it.\n\nJust past the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de Honduras en el Valle de Sula, and spanning the R\u00edo Bermejo, is Colonia El Pedregal, which has residential high-rises.Further out, north across the R\u00edo Bermejo, running to the edge of the city, and with calles (streets) renumbering from 1 up, are Colonia Los Alpes and Rancho El Coco and Residencial Los Cedros and Colonia La Tara.Far to the north is Colonia Fesitranh.\n\n\n=== Northeast ===\nBarrio Las Acacias is just to the north of center. Nor-Este neighborhoods include Barrio San Cristobal, Villa Florencia, Colonia Ideal, Barrio Moraz\u00e1n, Colonia Modelo, and further out Colonia Bogr\u00e1n, Colonia El Carmen, and Colonia Los Laureles.\n\n\n=== Southeast ===\nIncludes the road to the airport, Aeropuerto Internacional Ramon Villeda Morales and to the city of La Lima.  Southeast neighborhoods include Barrio Medina (11 Calle SE to Avenida Juan Pablo II, 4 Avenida SO to 10 Avenida SE), Colonia La Aurora (defined by 7 Calle SE to 10 Calle SE, and 14 Avenida SE to Segundo Anilo (approximately where 18 Avenida would be), Barrio Caba\u00f1as, Barrio La Navidad, San Pedro, Barrio Las Palmas, Barrio San Lu\u00eds, Colonia La Uni\u00f3n, Barrio La Paz.  Farther out: Colonia Rivera Hern\u00e1ndez, San Cristobal.\n\n\n=== Chamelec\u00f3n ===\nWith dateline giving San Pedro Sula as the location, the New York Times in 2014 described the Chamelec\u00f3n district as a \"warren of modest cement-block houses painted in now chipped and fading pastels\", subject to pressure of street gangs. This is not the Colonia El Chamelec\u00f3n neighborhood within San Pedro Sula, but rather it is the Chamelec\u00f3n that lies outside to the south of San Pedro Sula, on the Chamelec\u00f3n River.\n\n\n=== Various ===\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe Villa Ol\u00edmpica is a multi-sporting complex that has facilities for most Olympic style games including football, boxing, swimming, baseball, cycling and multipurpose gymnasiums.San Pedro Sula is the only city in the country that houses to two football stadiums. The Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Metropolitano is located in the Villa Ol\u00edmpica and is the largest in the country with a capacity of 42,000. The Estadio Francisco Moraz\u00e1n is located in the center of the city and holds 23,000 people. The stadiums are home to San Pedro Sula's most popular professional football teams Marath\u00f3n and Real CD Espa\u00f1a.As of 2009, San Pedro Sula has been the home venue for Honduras national football team matches.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Cathedral ===\nIt has a Catholic cathedral that was built in 1949. as well as a Greek Orthodox cathedral, Iglesia Ortodoxa de Antioqu\u00eda San Juan Bautista, built in 1963.\n\n\n=== Currust\u00e9 ===\nThis archeological site is two kilometers along the street that goes to Lake Jucutuma.\nExpeditions from 2006 found multiple pre-Columbian pieces, and ruins of an unknown civilization. The ruins are currently abandoned since 2009, it was reported that during Rodolfo Sunseri administration in 2006-2009 that he pretended to rescue the park with 4 million Lempiras, but the project never started.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n San Pedro Sula travel guide from Wikivoyage\nHonduras Weekly\nUniversidad de San Pedro Sula",

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country.

In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts that allowed the team to rise again as one of the most important in the country.\n\nLa Paz F.C. : Founded in 1989, the club quickly rose through the ranks to become the third major club in the capital, only behind in popularity to the two well-established city rivals.The city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:\n\nAcademia de Balompi\u00e9 Boliviano\nAlways Ready\nChaco Petrolero\nClub 31 de Octubre\nDeportivo Municipal de La Paz\nFraternidad Tigres\nMariscal Braun\nUniversitario de La Paz\nClub Uni\u00f3n MaestranzaWith the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Uni\u00f3n Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the Estadio Hernando Siles, which also hosts the national football team and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times.

Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

        "wiki": "The Coromuel wind is a weather phenomenon unique to the La Paz area of the Baja California peninsula and adjoining Gulf of California.  Occurring primarily in the late spring and summer, it is a south to south-west wind that typically starts late in the afternoon or early evening and blows throughout the night into the mid-morning. It has a rapid onset and can be very strong especially in the Bay of La Paz.The basic mechanism of the Coromuel winds is fairly clear. The winds are created when the cool marine air from the Pacific side of the peninsula are drawn over the desert to the relatively warmer side of the Gulf of California.  It only occurs in the La Paz area because this is the only place on the peninsula that does not have a spine of mountains blocking such an air flow.The winds receive their name after Samuel Cromwell, a sailor from the 19th century, believed to be a pirate. He visited La Paz often and, according to legend, hid one of his biggest treasures on the beach that carries his name. Since natives could not pronounce his surname, they called him \"Coromuel.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNames of winds (Coromell)",

        "wiki": "This article lists the 3,143 counties and county equivalents of the United States. The 50 states of the United States are divided into 3,007 counties, political and geographic subdivisions of a state.  236 other local governments and geographic places are also first-order administrative divisions of their respective state/district/territory, but are called by different names. These are referred to collectively as county equivalents by the United States Census Bureau.  The 236 county equivalents include 100 equivalents in the territories (such as those in Puerto Rico) outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The large majority of counties and equivalents were organized by 1970.  Since that time, most creations, boundary changes and dissolutions have occurred in Alaska and Virginia.Among the 50 states, 44 are partitioned entirely into counties, with no county equivalents. Louisiana is instead divided into 64 equivalent parishes, while Alaska is divided into 19 equivalent boroughs and 11 sparsely populated census areas, the latter also known collectively as the unorganized borough.  Virginia is composed of a mixture of 95 counties and 38 independent cities.  Maryland, Missouri and Nevada are each composed entirely of counties, except that each also has exactly one independent city: Baltimore, St. Louis, and Carson City, respectively.  The District of Columbia is a single federal district that is not part of any state or county.  All of the above 136 exceptional cases are reckoned as county equivalents.  The number of counties (or equivalents) per state ranges from the three counties of Delaware, to the 254 counties of Texas.  In New England, where the town model predominates, several counties have no corresponding local governments, existing only as historical, legal, and census boundaries.  These are the counties of Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as 8 of Massachusetts' 14 counties. In all, the 50 states consist of 3,142 counties and equivalents. Adding the District of Columbia gives 3,143.\nSimilarly, the Census Bureau treats 100 subdivisions of the territories of the United States as county equivalents.  These are the 78 municipalities of Puerto Rico, the three major islands of the U.S. Virgin Islands, the three districts and two atolls of American Samoa, Guam as a single island and county equivalent, the four municipalities of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the nine island territories of the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands.

          "Did this following many recommendations and a Red Cap tour (also recommend) with discount to 130 Bolivia (normally 160) and have to say it was one of the best things we did in Bolivia! Simply turn up after 1400, wait a mo (depending on how many people are there), get trained up",
          "This was definitely one of the best things in La Paz. An amazing experience and something you shouldn't miss when in La Paz",
          "One of the best things Ive ever done ! The staff was professional and really made you feel 100% safe. They only charge 150 Bolivianos for 1 jump. A must if you have never done that before. Would recommend doing abseiling with Urban Rush to everyone. And dont forget to tip ;-)",
          "Urban rush was great. The employees did an excellent job to prepare us. The costumes are a very nice touch. I went with what I imagine is the most popular--spiderman. My mom was not to thrilled when I sent her the pictures Urban Rush took.",
          "i really enjoyed this service, good guides, good equipment, and really good view of down town in La Paz.",
          "Brilliant experience. Very professional team. Good value for money and a must if you haven't done abseiling before.",
          "Super professional team, patient and clear in instructions in both English and Spanish. We felt comfortable with the safety setup and the jump was the most amazing experience! You have to do this if you're in La Paz you won't regret it.",
          "Super professional staff, extremely safe but oh so scary at the same time! A huge rush of adrenaline and great fun. Highly recommended for everyone!",
          "Professional guys, very helpful and fun. Good training before jump that make you feel a lot better, but scary it is anyway. Good price and cool experience.",
          "First thing you think with these kind of extreme sports is safety first. Urban rush is just doing that, make you feel safe. They give you loads of information and time for training to make you feel more confident. Let's be honest: everyone that jumps out of a window of a",
          "As much of a tourist-centric activity this is, don't miss out. It's an incredible experience. Definitely scary when they keep telling you \"lean forward more, more, MORE!\" when you're 17 stories up, but when it's all said and done, you'll want it do it again. I regret not doing",
          "This is the last thing I did at the end of 3 days in La Paz - yesterday I did the Death Road and today I abseiled down the big green building in the middle of La Paz! Great views from the 17th floor of Hotel President, very safe, and the staff really do take the utmost care of",
          "When I read that I could run of a building dressed as spiderman, I was in. I had a great time. The instructors are knowledgeable, professional and gave me a good practice run before going for the real deal. I had a lot of fun! Also, it's not expensive at all.",
          "So when I looked up the 17 stories where people were dropping out of, I thought...OK shouldn't be a problem.., then when I got up there and looked out the window and down, I thought there is no way I'm doing this.... but I HAVE to I thought.. I can't wimp out. So without giving",
          "It was a breath-taking experience. It is totally safe to get down the building having in mind that the personnel there is well-trained and caring. But you need to overcome your own fear and make the first step. Everything else would be handled by the guys who work there.",
          "My highlight of LaPaz, Urban Rush was incredibly fun and safe. There were three staff members and they were all very knowledgeable and spoke perfect English. It was great value for money and would recommend to anyone who enjoys an adrenaline rush.",
          "It was super quite the afternoon we did it so we had the place to ourselves, the guides were kind and thorough with training. It's terrifying but make sure you do it twice. Once isn't enough! Also, riding the elevator up dressed up as batman is worth paying money for.",
          "Great fun, amazingly safe and we'll worth a visit. Right In Town!! The guys there were really nice and spoke great English.",
          "You will never forget this experience! First I was really scared. But after the instructions of a very competent and professional team I felt safe enough to walk and jump down the building. Thank you for that great experience!!!",
          "Yesterday I did the rappelling through Urban Rush. The staff was incredibly helpful and patient, and - most importantly - professional and personable. The staff put me at ease and made me feel so comfortable that I (surprisingly) didn't have any butterflies when I walked out",
          "A must do! Awesome fun and the team are so friendly and experienced that they make you feel safe and as relaxed as possible for sepping out of the 17th floor! They take lots of pics for free so you can remember the experience and put on their facebook page.",
          "For my 30th birthday by boyfriend surprised me with this. Best surprise ever! So I donned my Spider-Man attire and abseiled face first off the building. It was great fun. Unfortunately the wall is very slippy and converse don't have much grip, so I may have slipped down most",
          "Jumping out of this 17 storey building confirmed to me that I am, in fact, scared of heights. But the rush I got from seeing it through was totally worth the panic attack. The staff were so patient, and the training was as thorough as could be. Getting to wear costumes was a",
          "Im not good with heights - the title might hint at that but I like to try things like this. I really wasnt sure if I could do it but the staff were patient and helped me fight my fear. Did two drops first going backwards which helped my confidence then I actually did a forward",
          "Urban Rush. Great name. I told myself I would do it. I went there to check it out first. Looks scary as hell from the top and I didn't think I could do it. But I made a promise to myself. Here's a video of my jump. http://bit.ly/1P0mx7q",
          "A must do in La Paz! One of the best things I've ever done! I just arrived with no booking and the guys had me going down the building in no time! They were all very professional, patient and fun :)",
          "Myself and a friend called up to urban rush not fully sure would we do the activity...... A staff member showed us around, put zero pressure on us to partake and left us space to decide. I decided to do it front facing (and in a Spider-Man suit :) ) which was new for me and I",
          "This place is amazing! It is an adventure in a building! I went there once, and regret I haven't gone again! You are given classes for about 10 minutes and then you rappel down the building. Great place! Strongly recommend \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",
          "Urban Rush Bolivia has given me the adrenaline rush of a lifetime. I strolled into Hotel Presidente with my boyfriend (no reservation required) and I was met with an extremely friendly and funny staff. They were all able to speak fluently in both Spanish and English, which was a",
          "No reservation required, rocked up and we picked novelty suits to wear (hotdog, bacon, Spider-Man) before a tutorial on how to use the gear on the small indoor practice wall. Very professional staff, felt safe, great views and adrenaline rush and they share their photos on",
          "this is a great little day activity if youve got some time to spare and feel like going a bit crazy. Takes about 45mins-1hr all in all, and if youre nervous you can practice on the inside wall as much as you like, the staff are really helpful and cool people so they put you at",
          "This is an awesome experience! It's located inside the hotel across from Plaza San Francisco, and you can go directly to the floor. Once you walk into the hotel, there are signs everywhere to help (in English!). Once you get there, you can put your stuff in a locker. The staff",
          "My boyfriend amd I decided we would rather walk down the side of a building than take our chances on death road. The staff here were super friendly and supportive. I freaked out a few times trying to go face first. But the staff were coached me and eventually got me out that",
          "Going down a building face first - and the free fall!! What could be better!?? A great experience! Great fun!! And a great team!! Well done guys!!",
          "Great value for the adrenaline rush, very safe, helpful and friendly english speaking staff, thanks guys!",
          "Totally recommend!! The people were so friendly. Of course I was scared but they make me really comfortable. It is safe and you can practise before you start.",
          "Amazing movement ever in life I ever saw. Just wanted to go again with my love. Waiting in bolivia hope will go soon",
          "Words fail to describe just how fun Urban Rush is, this is very simply a must do if you are in La Paz for any quantity of time! Make space for this in your schedule as it will likely be the highlight of your stay in this city. The staff are wonderfully friendly and always",
          "The face first rappel was awesome and also the free fall was cool. In addition, the view from the top is awesome.",
          "Did this yesterday and it was so much fun! I only did one rapel; I had to go get a bus, but the staff were great and I would definitely recommend doing it. Total time was about 40 mins including suiting up&training&the drop. I went face first and got to free fall. I was the",
          "I admitted i chickened out a day before, but I plucked up courage and glad I did it. They are patient and professional, and you feel very safe. It also makes you feel better to see everyone else before look scared.",
          "Amazing experience. Totally safe. Mini rappel in the hotel to practice on before you exit the building. Great prices too!",
          "Jumping off 17 stories. Super safe super fun, you get to free fall as well. Great way to get your heart rate up if you're into that.",
          "I really enjoyed this simple attraction. Big wall ... Off you go. You have the choice to absail down or go forward, the latter being a little bit more adventurous. Funny costumes, all over them! Very well priced at about 10 dollars. Take the leap.",
          "I found this adventure online while researching for \"what to do\" in La Paz. So, if you are an Adrenalin Junkie you HAVE to do this! I saw the building from the bottom and thought \"well it's quite high\". Then I went up to Urban Rush and saw it from above and thought \"oh my god,",
          "The guides are super expirenced, very patient and english speakers! Makes you feel very safe and at the same time the andrenaline rush! Very recommended!",
          "Its fun, a bit short but the lcompany is really professional.. I really recommand it ...............",
          "I didn't expect this to be as great and terrifying as it was. I've bungeed, skydived, done death road, etc but walking off the edge of that building was almost impossible for me to do. Afterwards it was just plain fun! And the free-fall was the best part!!! Cheap, quick, fun",
          "I had jumped off the Stratosphere in Vegas before so I was pumped to do this. They gave us two options, face first or backwards. I thought backwards was pretty lame so I chose face first. The staff was very professional and made sure we were safe. They were very experienced.",
          "Such an amazing thing to do and very safe! Staff are so so so lovely! I think my husband enjoyed it more than me but I am so proud of myself for doing it.",
          "It was lots of fun! We felt that the team is very experienced and it's really safe! Totally recommendable",
          "I was slightly terrified but the guides were great -- professional and safety conscious. It's an awesome way to see the whole city sprawled out in front of you and it's super cheap at just 15 quid! You receive a full briefing first and then away you go - with the guides above",
          "One of my friends told me about Urban Rush so I wanted to try it out. I got there and have to admit that I was pretty terrified. But the guides made me feel extremely comfortable with the equipment and training and I'm so glad I did it. I definitely recommend it to everyone!",
          "It seemed so easy when we were practicing. When my turn came, I chickened out. I couldn't do it! Good thing the staff assured me that they will be guiding me all the way. That day, I learned to let go! Their gears are very safe and the crew are very experienced. You don't have",
          "We did skydiving and bungee jumping, we thought we wont enjoy this as we've done the extreme before! Well, my partner and I together with a friend just did it today! We super like it! I used the spiderman costume while Jon used the batman costume! ha! I love the free fall! The",
          "Unbelievably true, you can actually go down like spiderman. rush of adrenaline all the time and you feel like you are going to end smashed. Good experience!",
          "Incredible experience you could have in the middle of LA Paz. It was fast fun and beyond. It was the best Bolivians we spent.",
          "The staff were excellent - very helpful and made me feel safe the whole way down. It's not everyday you get to abseil down a hotel in the middle of a city, and this experience is certainly unique and worthwhile doing at least once.",
          "Loved it was there in february 2013 and it simply was an Urban Rush :) The last bit was done in free fall and never had my heart beating so fast in my life.",
          "Been to La Paz Bolivia In March this year, we paid the full price not the discounted tour price to start of with. Once we got there asking about safety we were faced with a really moody woman who didn't really seem interested. when we asked about the picutures they said they",

          "After our free city walk we had the opportunity to go rapelling down the building. It was the 15th floor of a fancy hotel. With the sun out and the square nearby, it was a nice environment to walk down a building. We picked a funny costume, were suited up, got instructions,",
          "Cheap as chips and highly fun! dress up as superheroes and descend down a big massive building in the middle of La Paz, it is what it is..... QUALITY!!! the free fall in particular was wicked!! highly recommend it, get it done!!!",
          "They had all the equipment i needed and were friendly and patient i felt safe all the way downdown i would do it all over again once im back in la paz the price is also good cause is really cheap ...and you get the chance to have a look at presidente hotel five stars and",
          "This was great!! Get to dress up like a superhero (or a piece of bacon..) and walk down the side of a building. My only regret: the building is slippery! It's hard to keep your fees on the side and actually \"walk\" - maybe bring some grippy shoes with you!",
          "It was definitely what I was looking for-a safe but exhilerating experience in Bolivia. It didn't cost too much and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in going off the beaten trail in Bolivia.",
          "It was the first time I did such an activity. I was a little bit scared at the beginning but the staff trained me first and I really felt safed all time long. I really recommend to do it if you spend some days in La Paz! Such an amazing Experience!!!!!!!",
          "Really loved this activity - it was a huge adrenalin rush and something completely different. It was also very cheap for what it was - $20 to scale and abseil down a building! We had to wait a bit until a decent sized group assembled, but the views were pretty fab so no",
          "Everything about Urban Rush was incredible. They were super friendly, and made sure you were 100% comfortable before starting the descent. Plus, you get to wear your favorite superhero's costume! The only thing I would recommend is to bring Bolivianos. I had to pay in dollars",
          "I did the rappelling down the side of a building and it was awesome. They have superhero costumes (including spiderman and a strip of bacon) to make it even better: Staff may have seemed unprofessional because they were all young and playing with each others hair and smoking,",
          "I loved doing this! You get a nice discount if you do the free walking tour first and mention the Red Caps. The staff is very helpfull and you get to wear a nice spiderman suit if you want to. They explain everything clear and actually it's not that hard to do. But it's a lot of",
          "I was a little nervous because of the height and the cheap price (100 bolivianos when you do the Red Cap free walking tour) but they were very friendly and professional. Two safety ropes with one person at the top and one at the bottom. Really fun experience.",
          "If you are in La Paz Urban Rush is a must do! I guess you already know what the attraction is all about if you're reading this. Its worth doing the Free City Tour as this gives you 50bs off your jump; if not just turn up and pay the 150bs. The staff were really good and they",
          "If you're in La Paz and not too afraid of heights, then this should be right up your street. Get a taxi to take you to El Presidente hotel, take the lift inside the hotel to the top, 2 flights of stairs and you're there. Sign away your disclaimer, suit up, harness up, then",
          "What an experience the day after The Death Road mountain bike...this was an amazing thrill so much so that we went upstairs and jumped out again... loved the clown outfits too made me feel like a puppet, I loved the freefall the most.",

          "this takes just an hour to do ... it is fun filled adrenalin rush ... less cheap and well worth the experience ... YOU MUST DO THIS ...",
          "Decided to do this after our bus was delayed. Staff were very professional and well trained, felt vey safe and comfortable. Well worth it - best thing I did in La Paz!",
          "All the staff was encouraging and helpful getting you to lean out the window looking down 17 stories. Made you feel safe and secure on a scary thing to do. Was fun and a good time. Must do when you are in La Paz. Great way to end the Red Cap free walking tour.",
          "Good adrenaline rush, felt safe at all times, especially since they had a small training wall inside to practice on first! Staff very nice",
          "I'm terrified of heights but still loved it, do it in the bacon costume and you can do it with the camera helmet",

          "If you are a massive adrenalin junky this is probably not for you, as a pre skydive or bungee warm up it is great though. Guides wear awesome, spoke great English, and talked you through every step very clearly and made everyone feel very comfortable, Make sure you use one of",

          "I almost chickened out but that was purely down to my fear of heights!!! As we were doing it for charity I had to do it....but by the time it was done I was so glad I did it. Couldnt ask for safer equipment and the staff were great! Give safety run through before hand and are",
          "The free fall is well worth it. Great view of the city and a cool buzz abseiling down the side of the build. Plenty of costumes to dress up in also!",
          "I'm an adrenaline junkie and I loved it! The staff are super friendly and helpful! They even took pictures of me on my camera while scaling the wall. We also go to wear spiderman suits which I think was frosting on the cake. They have had no accidents and the thing could not be",
          "If you go to La Paz make sure you do this. The free walking tour finishes here, which is also one of the best things to do in La Paz.So you have the option to pay $20 to absail down 17 stories, so much fun.",
          "Urban Rush is a professional, safe, well run, adrenalin kick that is without a doubt one of the most fun things you can do in downtown La Paz. If you can get over your fear of heights then don't miss this amazing experience.",
          "Professional and well organised. It was a unique experience and a thrill for my daughter. The photos were a bonus",
          "So high, so good! After you paid, you wouldn't have your money back if you finally would like to stay... so we go down...",
          "This experience was AMAZING. I will definitely recommend it. I have never felt so safe doing adventure. The staff was very kind, and explained all the safety rules in good English. Very understanding if you were afraid of the heights, and very patient on the practice wall if you",
          "This company is very well organized and has all the right safety equipment. Going down just once was more than enough of a thrill. They explain everything in English extremely well. Gear is extremely well maintained and safe. No issue running down the side of a hotel with an",
          "Fun way to spend part of your tour of the city, but I feel it is slightly overrated. The people at the organisation are really well trained and let you take as much time as you need getting used to the feeling of walking down vertically. A good stepping stone into adventure",
          "Just the most amazing rush, incredible fun, totally safe but utterly terrifying, you will truly test yourself, whilst dressed as a superhero! The staff here are incredibly professional, the set-up is infinitely superior to absolutely anything else I have seen in Bolivia, and the",
          "Going down a 17 storey building head first was not on the to do list when coming to la paz but I am so glad I went ahead with it. From start to finish this is a totally brilliant experience. The staff make you feel confident and safe throughout and all speak English. The plot",
          "This is a 50m rappel from a building downtown in La Paz. You can go Australian style (face-first) which is totally awesome. They teach you how to do it, and you can dress up in crazy costumes. I was santa claus with a superhero mask on. The rappel offers a good view of downtown,",
          "So I've done abseiling before, I do a lot of rock climbing but this was so differnt, first off: YOU'RE GOING FORWARDS, but this is optional, but I HIGHLY recommend it. Like I said, I've done a lot of climbing and these guys were totally professional. All the gear looked well",
          "It's something to do that's different in the city. The staff were great and made me feel very safe. Suggestion: GO TWICE! It is so inexpensive if you pay upfront and you can rappel one time and go face first the other.",

          "I did this after being egged on by my 10 year old daughter (who, incidentally, was too young to do it!). The training was adequate, though the guide only gave the demonstration in spanish (as the majority of people in our group were spanish), but english training is given if you",

          "I am so glad I did this! It is the biggest rush ever and I felt totally safe. The guys at Urban Rush are really professional and so friendly - they made me feel totally safe even though I was terrified to begin with!! Thank you, Urban Rush - I had a ball!!",
          "You need to do this ... Cheap activity with maximum thrill.. Anyone can do this .. it is very safe and so much FUN",
          "So courteous and helpful. I felt so safe and would do it a million times over. I recommend going down face first and to also do it twice. Your first round you get used to it! Urban Rush was a thrilling experience.",
          "Considering you are repelling off a building in the middle of a city (literally smack in the middle) you'd think it would require expertise or at least a lengthy 'how to' session but the whole thing took 20 minutes. Perfect fun and easy activity when seeing La Paz. If you are",
          "Ive never come across this before, its a unique, fun and cheap thing to do during your visit to La Paz. You dont need to book, you just turn up. You have the choice of a standard orange suit or a fun but slightly stinky fancy dress suit (batman, catwoman, santa, spiderman,",

          "Go here as well and you might as well stop at the beaches along the way. SO amazing. We went on a sunday and it was busy. I bet a week day you could have it to yourself. The next beach over has bars and jet ski rentals etc.",
          "One of the top 10 most beautiful beaches in the world. Clean, safe, quiet and some reefs to do some snorkelling..!",
          "The beach is really nice, plus the view from the surrounding hills is really worth the short climb (<5mn). The beach is small and the number of free umbrellas is limited, so you should get there early (before 9am).",
          "Balandra beach really is beautiful, u like anything I had ever seen. The color of the water against the rock formations and mountains are so beautiful. The only downside would have to be the stingrays. There are a lot her please be careful! My son got stung by one and we had to",

          "Amazing little beach area. Looks to be gaining more popularity so unlikely to be as secluded as you would like. Make sure you have some cash to rent a kayak!",
          "This was a very fun experience. If you want sun all day go down to the left, as the sunset begins to set the shade covers the right side. If you want shade well you get the idea.... Make sure to stroll in the water around the point and head across to see the Hongo, its one of La",
          "If you\u2019re in La Paz, you have to make a trip out to Balandra Beach! We arrived at 5:30 PM and watched the sunset until 8 PM. It was the most beautiful sunset I have ever seen. The water is clear and shallow. Tons of pelicans were diving all around us and even within a few feet",
          "A PIECE OF HEAVEN...Get there by 9:30am to secure parking and a good spot, there are about 20 palapas free of charge, If you get there with the crowd after 11am, expect difficulty finding parking, you can still get a shade and chairs for about $30 pesos a piece. THIS IS A",
          "What a gem. A treasured natural area, which the Mexicans are doing their best to preserve. Swim with mullets, cornetfish, and jacks. Find teeny red-clawed hermit crabs and gorgeous brittle stars. Hike well above the water on the volcanic cliffs. And remember how special",
          "We liked the beach. We camped here for a night and went for a swim. Very quiet an scerene. There are restaurants in the area but we found the food to be expensive. The beer looked reasonable but we didn't stay. They have bathrooms for use but you have to pay. There are no",
          "Great time, reasonable prices. Loved our stay. Nice that it was a short trip by bot to the whale shark feeding area.",
          "Absolutely gorgeous beach - the water looks like a swimming pool. Go early to get a palapa and parking spot. They had kayak rentals at the beach. I wore water shoes and took a long walk around the bend through the shallow water. So beautiful, we had to go back twice!",

          "Peaceful and relaxing. Take a short hike up to get a better view. It is breathtaking plus a UNESCO site. There is some sun shade provided or you can purchase. We went to another side of the beach and just hung out for a bit. Note: stingrays in the area so make sure you shuffle",
          "Enjoyed the 3 mile hike around the beaches with incredible views, and the miles of white sand beaches, good snorkeling around the reefs. We stayed away from the main beach other than at the start and end of each day here. Shallow waters for miles.",
          "One of the most beautiful, unique and unspoiled beaches I have ever visited. So happy it has been untouched by many of the mega resorts that have ruined many other beaches in Mexico. It is worth a trip to La Paz just to see this beach.",
          "Not to be missed. Check the tide table and go when it's falling so you can wade out to the mouth of the bay. Worth the drive up there.",
          "We were told by several that the drive from Cabo to Playa Balandra was 1 1/2 hours. We found even without much traffic it was 2 1/2 hours one way. We rented a car and stopped at Todos Santos to see Hotel California and at La Paz to see the local festival setting up and to get",

          "Went here with the hubby on a Monday afternoon. There were trinkets, snacks, and drinks for sale (non-alcoholic). We walked across the small bay to our own private beach were the hubs snorkeled around some rocks with excellent results. I walked around in the shallows and saw",
          "This is an amazing beach away from tour areas of La Paz. We took an Uber to the beach and arranged a pickup time later in the day. We hiked, walked the lagoon, and relaxed in the sun. It was perfect. The water was too cold to swim (visited in February) but perfect to cool",

          "This is beach is very clean and there are palapas at no charge. Vendors are very polite and there are not many of them. Great place for kids as the whole bay is no more than mid thigh deep. Mostly ankle deep.",
          "We loved Balandra. We took an Uber there from our hotel in La Paz and spent the day there. There is a shuttle you can take but we wanted to get there early in the morning (before the shuttle started running for the day). There are basic toilets. There was a couple keeping them",
          "Visited on our lunch stop on our whale shark excursion. Pulled in, anchored the boat and enjoyed lunch, sitting on the sand. Simply Breath-taking, shallow, no one but the 8 of us there . . .the water and sand were like coves in the Caribbean. You can drive about 1/2 an hour",
          "We went out to Balandra Beach after swimming with the whale sharks and sea lions, the beach is majestic! Super soft white sandy beaches and plenty of fish to see while snorkeling. It is perfect for paddleboarding too!",
          "Even though we visited on the weekend, there was plenty of room on the beach. The sea was out so as there is only a gentle gradient paddling was the order of the day. Apart from someone flying a drone and a couple of others swilling beer and listening to AC/DC it was free of",

          "One of the most beautiful beaches on the planet. Almost no amenities, but worth it. Just to stare and wonder at the beauty of Baja. The last time we were there, some vendors were there and we had to pay for a shaded spot. But this is a must see.",
          "We went on a weekend and the place was packed. There are palapas to rent but most people brought their own shade. Crowds aren't our thing so we wandered in the shallow waters (the tide was out) for a half hour before leaving. Very picturesque and I'd be happy to spend more time",
          "This beach is magical. When the tide is out you can walk a long way out to the mushroom rocks. The water is a spectacular shade of aqua. It\u2019s a must see sea!",
          "This beach was perfect! We were able to walk a little ways from the the parking lot and it felt like we had the place to our selves. The water is shallow a long ways out so it was great for strolling in water up to your hips and louging around in the ocean",
          "If you have the chance, this place is a must! Balandra beach is amazing! From cabo san lucas it is about a 2 hour drive, you can even spend the night at a hotel in town. The water is very calm and cristal clear! Perfect for kids to swim or learn on there own.",
          "We came here on a Sunday and although there were quite a few people it wasn\u2019t overcrowded and we were able to find a peaceful spot. We got some fresh coconuts before heading to our spot. You\u2019re able to walk out through the water across the majority of the bay as it\u2019s only 2-3",

          "Rented a car for the day and drove up to Balandra, commute was roughly a half hour. Parked right in the very front of the parking lot closest to the beach. Grabbed a spot under one of the palapas. Wandered over the rocks and around to the other beach and walked to the mushroom",

          "This beach ranks one of the top ten that I've ever been to. There is something unique about being surrounded in this large 'cove', 'bay', or whatever we should call it. The tide comes in/out and it can be like being in a swimming pool. White sand, totally clear, turquoise",
          "I guess we were there at low tide. VERY shallow. Was told by a tour guide that you can snorkel there. Must only happen at high tide so be sure to check before you go. Lovely location, food truck and the usual vendors.",
          "An amazing natural land and seascape. I'd recommend coming ready to hike a little and perhaps wade a bit and you can get away from the crowds and maybe have a couple hundred yards of pristine beach to yourself. Hike up to get the birds eye view from the top of the central hill",
          "We loved this huge \u2018pool\u2019 . You can walk around with water ranging from your knees to your chest for the most part . If you do walk straight across the beach there\u2019s a spot that\u2019s deep enough that you have to swim thru it .",
          "It is a very unique place. The last 10 minutes of drive is very beautiful. We got there early and grabbed shade under a palapa. It did not take long for the crowds to come. It was a week before Christmas so we expected it to be busy. Very sad to see people using the",
          "Beautiful beach Very good point of view Ideal for child because not dangerous at all Not easy to park car because many people",
          "Honestly, beach is simply awesome. Water is warm, quiet and so pure. The cool visit could be in week days (early in the morning) because is very popular. Parking for free. Eco-friendly bathroom. No showers but is fine. Palapas (eco-umbrellas) are for free: first come, first",
          "Love it. The best vista is the south part of the beach with a view of the mountains and the beach. Get a coco for 60 pesos, enjoy the white sand. Climb to the top of the hill for the best view.",
          "Beautiful beach. Well worth the 100 Peso return for the bus at the time we were there. The bus terminal in La Paz at the Malecon had Eco Baja Tour Buses that ran to the beaches. The only problem was that the bus can't turn around in the parking lot so they stop at a pull out",
          "Family oriented beach with minimal services available. Take the bus from the malecon for a few dollars or rent a car. Parking was limited on the Christmas holiday we visited. Had a great experience with the bus. There were vendors offering service from a restaurant 1 km away but",
          "Please arrive early so you can enjoy the beach without the crowd. Take goggles and a snorkel because fish are beautiful in there, and prepare to spend hours of il dolce far niente. Amazing place with cristaline water, no waves, nd you can walk a mile with the cold water up to",
          "A beautiful beach surrounded by rock and cactus. Our hotel ran a shuttle to the beach which was about 30 min away. There are shaded palapas however they were all taken when we got there. Henry was renting umbrellas, table and chairs if you want. A couple of stalls selling cold",
          "This is a great beach, especially if you have little kids (which we don't). Its really shallow and has \"3 lagoons\". You can actually walk across to the other side to several other beaches as well, its nice and shallow. But if you want to go for a swim you can definitely wade out",
          "Beautiful shallow beach where you can wade for hundreds of yards in any direction! Clear, clean water that feels great. If you\u2019re in La Paz, you HAVE to come here. I do have some suggestions on how to make sure you get the best experience. Think of this beach as more of a park",
          "This is a must see when visiting la Paz. The water is crystal clear and warm. You can wade comfortably for several hundred yards. Recommend hiking the trails above.",
          "Gorgeous turquoise bay facing the Sea of Cortes. The water is shallow with sandy bottom so you can literally walk across to the other side. I walked across bare foot but there are some stinging sting rays under sand, so would use Aqua Socks next time. Take the Aguila bus",
          "The beach was picture perfect and super warm. Even with a few people there it did not seem crowded. A great way to spend two or three hours.",
          "Wonderful beach. Great hike around to the mushroom rock formation around the corner. The tides are interesting as well as it almost empties out at low tide.",
          "Dont stay on the first beach, there are three! Summon up a little effort and walk/swim around to the third bay and you might have your very own paradise!",

          "This place is the busiest beach we visited while in Baja Sur. The main beach was a little crowded, so we waded around the rock point to the second beach and had a great time sunning and swimming. The only good snorkeling we found was on the rocks near the mushroom rock. There's",

          "Our tour group spent an hour here. The water is amazing...super calm and you can walk to the other side since the water was so shallow. There are people here selling snacks and renting out equipment and chairs and umbrellas. Would have rated this beach a 5 except the outhouse",

          "Extremely beautifully clear water . Great place to spend the day.. We packed a cooler and spent the entire day",
          "We rented a car and drove to balandra , very easy and fast from La Paz. No need to tell you how, just follow signs . Amazing scenery , you\u2019ll see mangroves .... cactus forest and amazing beaches on the way there. There is a truck that sells a bit of everything , so if you are",
          "I was here at low tide and was able to walk out to the mushroom rock but take water shoes or sandals incase the water is higher. What an amazing sight!",
          "The public beach has parking and porta potties, incredible views, warm shallow waters, white sand and was very clean when we were there on a Saturday. Plenty of space to spread out too. Other beaches in the area can be reached only by boat and are also spectacular. Take a photo",
          "This beach is pretty amazing totally chill, guys selling hats and food kids playing nobody acting stupid the clearest calmest water I've ever seen white sand, slight drive to get to but no big deal. I'd give it 5 stars but at the end of the day it still just a beach.",
          "This is a must while visiting La Paz. The bays are full of colors and life. The parking lot leads to one of the bays that most of the people go to. I would recommend going over the small hill and go to the other bay. Bring snorkel gear, umbrella and environmentally safe",
          "Great beach for kids, a few vendors with umbrellas, etc. Make sure your trip does not coincide with a ferry departure - took us more than 1hr from La Paz due to ferry traffic. Our toddler loved the water, but I have never seen so many wasps in one place.",
          "Driving from las Cabos to la Paz is scenic and interesting drive on mostly well-paved divided Hwy. The malecon walk and drive thru the centro area are the main attractions of the town. The Balandra Beach is not worth spending time to drive. Contrary to our expectation that the",
          "One of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen. A true gem with clear and calm waters and beautiful hikes",
          "The beach is beautiful but full of algae. There is a lot of people and a lot of noise and music. The parking is just next to the beach which is very ugly. You can climb the mountains and walk all the beach across.",
          "The water is crystal clear and you can walk around the cove as the water is chest high at the deepest point. There are 2 coves to explore. Kayak & SUP boards available to rent. I would bring a float, sunscreen, a small cooler, and sun umbrella. Uber is available and very",
          "If you are visiting, you can rent an umbrella, chair and get food and drink at the beach. Of course, you can always bring your own. Not much for snorkeling, but it is a relaxing spot to soak up some sand. There is a public bathroom there as well.",
          "As part of our tour with VIP tours, Captain Eddy and guide Katrin prepared a great lunch on the beach. We'l come back on our own as it is an easy drive from La Paz.",
          "We decided to head to Balandra after visiting La Ventana and the area (actually we did a big loop from El Triunfo, up to La Ventana and then to Balandra Beach which was a nice way to spend a day). There were still a lot of people at the beach and in the water which looked as if",
          "This is a wonderful beach about 20 mins drive from La Paz. We got there around 10 am and found it to be quite and easy to park. Contrary to other reviews the is a refreshment truck selling drinks and snacks, and also toilet facilities ( just think of a massive litter box for",

          "We (2 adults and an 11 year old) spent an afternoon at this beach. This one is in my opinion the best 'family' beach. Warm clean waters, shallow beach, and white soft sand. What more can you ask for! And if that isn't enough at low tide you can walk along the shoreline to the",
          "Definitely preferred this beach hands down over Tecolote beach! Palapas are free to the public. Get there early and stay all day! Bring lunch, water, snacks in a cooler because no restaurants around. Beach is super clean, water is pristine and you can walk out prettty far and",
          "A must while in La paz or cabo. A 2:30 hour drive from cabo this is truly one of the most beautiful beaches on earth. Peaceful and clean. Highly recommend to BOB since there is no restaurants or stores.",

          "A must when visiting La Paz or Los Cabos. Nice, beautiful, clean. A real jewel. Take care of our planet and be conscious. Keep it clean. Nice people and attention. A must...",
          "This is a beautifull little cove just north of La Paz if you want to kick back on the beach and relax, It could do with a little resturant or a bar or even a shack that served food and drinks but worth a visit if you're in the vicinity.",
          "This was our favorite beach. Very nice and peaceful. The level of the water would barely go over your knees. Depending on the day, there could be almost no waves which makes it perfect for kids or people who are afraid of waves. Important to know: there are a few free Palapas,",
          "The perfect beach at the perfect location. We went during the week and it was not packed. I can see on the weekends the place being full but we were lucky to get one of the palapas and enjoyed a lovely day in this piece of paradise. A must when visiting La Paz",
          "Although it\u2019s a little bit overrated, as you need to walk more than 100 meters to get the water pass your knees, is a nice and safe beach to go with little ones.",
          "This quiet beach is absolutely gorgeous! Shallow turquoise water await to refresh and soothe you. The contrast against the white sand and arid backdrop is stunning! Not much in terms of activity... which is part of the charm! You CAN rent some kayaks and there is one",
          "We made the trip from Cabo to Balandra with much anticipation. Positives? Great coconut stand and soft sand. If you have kids it allows for wading without too much worry. Negatives? We found the beach a little smelly with dark weeds on parts of the sandy shoreline which was not",
          "Beautiful place with a nice blue water, but when we went, the tour man told us it was the first time in his life that the place was crazy crowded, so we didn\u2019t enjoy the please .

          "Balandra was spectacular, its the first I strolled in the beach..water was so clean & clear and you can walk from the shore and across walking..although the the end acroos is a deep cavity that you can\u2019t see the bottom so be careful...water was warm & perfect for non",
          "Easy to find, good parking area, very clean, shallow water, great to take children and pet. No restaurants in the area, BYO food and drinks or go to Tecolote next to it for lunch",

          "Balandra is amazing! You can swim in clean waters, I recommend you to use snorkel equipment. If you arrive on morning you have the beach only for you. You can also do Kyak and aquatic sports in this beach. Greetings from Portugal",
          "Balandra Beach is a beautiful retreat about 2 hours from Los Cabos. It is worth a day trip! The water is crystal clear and very warm. It is a lagoon so there are no waves or rip currents. There are some local vendors with fresh fruit, beverages, shaved ice and souvenirs.",
          "Great place for kids, very shallow waters. A must see attraction if you can't surf, but want to relax in the water. You can wade hundreds of meters out to sea, and a few vendors had delicious mangos on a stick.",
          "White sands, turquoise water, good palapa and also a place to rent umbrellas and buy something Everything you need to enjoy a great beach",
          "Not to miss when visiting La Paz. 30 minutes by car. Sandy White beaches, great for snorkeling. Suggestion take an umbrella and chairs and cooler with food and drinks. Don't miss this place",
          "The beach is gorgeous, but if you happen to be there during the weekend be ready to share the beauty with many many other people. We got there a little before noon and the beach was already pretty packed, but more people kept arriving steadily all afternoon. If you're not",
          "Certainly not what it used to be, does not live up to the hype anymore. Still a very nice beach in the early hours before it becomes super crowded. Perfect spot for kids, safe shallow crystal clear waters. No restroom or other services. Get there early and grab a free family",
          "My cousins and I came to Playa Balandra from Cabo San Lucas. Unfortunately, we came on a Sunday and it was packed, no area to put our stuff, visitors with loud DJ speakers. We decided to go to Playa Tecolote.",
          "we went here as part of the boat tour with the cortez club so they dropped us here while the divers went out. it's a pretty little spot with crystal clear water and a nice beach. they have a mushroom rock to look at and you can snorkel there as well. it was empty in the",
          "Not as cool as it used to be. Bit dirty nowadays. Super crowded. I rather visit other beaches. Small parking lot.",
          "I read all the wonderful reviews and was so hyped to take my teen son there. Got there on a Tuesday about 1PM and was so disappointed. Car lot was full and people were parked along both sides of a one lane unpaved road leading up to entrance so our van guide couldn't drive in. I",
          "Loved this beach, it was very busy when we went. Bring lots of water and snacks, and an umbrella for shade.",
          "We have spent several days at Balandra so far this trip, and it is our favorite hangout in La Paz. Heartily recommended. We have been riding the public bus from the terminal on the Malecon (just across from the two story waterfront pavillion) near the whale museum. Ecobaja",
          "Came here on the city bus from la Paz. Earliest bus is at 10am 100 pesos rt then it runs every 2 hours coming back. Beautiful and quiet when you get there early. There are palapas on the beach for shade. If they are all taken people don\u2019t mind sharing. You spend most of your",
          "This is an extraordinary place unprecedented in my experience. The whole huge bay it set in the midst of desert hills about a half-hour drive from La Paz. There are no bathrooms or restaurants at the beach, just a few food trucks. Its a locals family beach. The whole bay is",
          "Stopped at this beach for a quick swim. Left a camera and some cash in the trunk of the rental car. Returned a short time later and the car was still locked and seemingly undisturbed. Discovered cash missing when i got my wallet - no credit cards were taken. They went through my",
          "Highlight of our trip to la Paz. Water has great visibility and super shallow. We could see the little fish swim around and could walk half way across the beach with the water until our waist. Most beautiful sunset of our lives!",
          "This location is well worth a stop. It is a part of the natural preserve. It is very pretty and a clean area. On the day we visited, it was a bit cloudy and we got a break from the heat of the sun. This area has no staff members to help with questions and answers. There were",
          "Beautiful beach with pure white sand and shallow water. There are no facilities so pack a cooler, sunscreen, beach umbrella and snacks for a fun day. Bring your favorite floats to soak up the sun or snorkel. Approximately 3 hour drive each way from Cabo San Lucas.",
          "This one is clean and looks like a pool. My favorite from the area. Make sure you were swimming shoes.",
          "All a good experience. The favorite locals beach they say. We were given chairs to sit on the beach. Good place for children.",
          "Our friends and we like to leave our \"stuff\" on the beach and walk out a little into the water and plant our umbrellas and chairs. It's fun sitting in the water. If you go out further, you need to shuffle your feet so the little rays know you're coming their way so they have",
          "I can honestly say this is the nicest beach I have ever been to, the sand is so nice and soft, the water is so clear It feels like a big pool, awesome place to visit!",
          "if you're in la paz you have to explore this beach. bring some ceviche, water, beer and you're good to go :)",
          "A great place to relax, but a bit crowded sometimes. You can easily walk across the bay if the crowds get too much. Not much snorkeling. Great views from the hill overlooking the bay.",
          "Wow! I thought it was so beautiful here. Shallow, warm water that is perfectly still. I could have swam around all day. It was part of a tour so only had an hour. If you like swimming and the beach it is a must go while in La Paz.",
          "Balandra is an amazing beach young children and adults love this beach. About 2 miles of walking inside the warm water which never reach above our shoulders. Crystal clear water. Just beautiful. We adore this place.",
          "About 2 hours drive from Cabo. It\u2019s a hidden gem. We have visited so many beaches around the world, and this one is on the top of the list. Nature at its best. You can rent an umbrella and relax. Make sure you stop by la Paz for seafood on your way back",
          "Nice outing with a visiting amigo. When you go bring your own umbrella or get there early to score one of the many pomfon shaded areas on the shore",
          "This beach is absolutely gorgeous. Traveling with small children we have to be mindful of the waves and the water was absolutely perfect for our toddler here. It was something out of a postcard! We tried going the first time but didn\u2019t arrive until 11 and the palapa were all",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed this beach, only a short trip from La Paz. Kayaked in the mangroves and walked through the crystal clear, warm waters. You don\u2019t need a mask and snorkle to see an array of sea life. Next time we\u2019d take a cooler with cerveza and maybe a few snacks since",
          "We rented a car from Cabo to head this way, it was well worth the drive. The beaches are white, warm waters and crystal clear you can walk for miles in waste high water. Bring you own food and drinks as the cart is very expensive since it\u2019s unpopulated. You can rent paddles",
          "This beautiful beach was full of surprises. Maybe because I didn't do my homework, went on a whim and had no idea what to expect. Many wouldn't drive 2 hours out of Cabo San Lucas (the tourist area) and come to a beach they only heard from a local \"was beautiful and you can wade",
          "If you visit La Paz, Balandra beach is a must. Its a very safe beach, and you can walk inside the sea more that 100 yards. The scenario is amazing combining the dessert and the sea.",
          "Go as early as possible! One time we went by car around sunrise and it was so magical. There was no one there, climbed up the little mountain for a perfect view and enjoyed it so much. If you go early you are sure you have a beach umbrella to project yourself against the sun.",
          "Balandra is one of my favorite beaches to visit in La Paz BCS. It is located about 25min drive from La Paz. The beach offers turquoise blue clear waters that are amazing to walk and swim into. You can walk hundreds of feet into the ocean and will not sink in, 3-4ft deep. It's a",
          "Unadulterated beauty is necessary in this world. Why, one might ask, is it necessary? I say it is because of the potential for a sort of epiphany one might experience in the magnificence of the natural world that is not possible through any other medium of human expression;",
          "Came here and it was amazing, crystal clear waters and light blue colors. there was just some garbage around which was disappointing.",
          "The most gorgeous beach ever!!! You can walk and walk and the cristal clear water doesn't go higher than you're waist. It has beautiful white sandy beaches and it's an adventure to get to the famous rock!! Worth the climb through the rocks!!! One of my favorite places to go!!!",
          "2nd time in this beach and it is just very amazing. Last time there was no people, but this time, although it was crowded, we enjoyed very much. Worth going there even if you are in Cabo.",
          "Balandra is an absolutely amazing place. It is so peaceful and serene. It is the absolutely perfect place to spend a day. It's great for small children to play and enjoy the water safely. My 16 month old was able to wade in the water without fear of waves or rip tides. It was a",
          "It is one of the beaches I never saw before due to the good quality of water and the scenic landscaping.",
          "Absolutely beautiful location just 30 minutes from La Paz. In May the water is still a little chilly, but warm enough to snorkel or play... floating in the rafts was too cold. If you take snorkeling equipment, walk around the point towards the right, walk across that new beach",
          "Don \u2018t loose this place ! It is unforgettable. No doubt that is one of the best spot in Baja California",
          "During our 7-day trip to Cabo, we opted to be courageous and drive to see the famous Balandra Beach in La Paz, Mexico. The approximately 2-5 to 3 hour drive was fun. Parking was a breeze and it wasn't packed since most folks were either in school or at work. The water was at",
          "Balandra is by far one of my favourite beach in Mexico! It can be crowded but you can always find a spot to be on your own. It's just like paradise!!",
          "My friend and I spent a couple days in Baja California Sur M\u00e9xico and got a chance to take a road trip from Cabo San Lucas to La Paz BCS is around 2hrs away, we had been told about Balandra Beach, saw a couple of pictures online and decided to go, OMG!! What a beautiful place,",
          "Everyone should take the time to visit this beach. Beautiful stunning color and very shallow to walk in. Nice short drive from Hyatt Place where we stayed 20 minutes. There are no washrooms at this beach which was the only negative. Plenty of parking and there was a good amount",
          "We were able to rent SUP and cruise around the whole area. It was beautiful beach with clear blue water.",
          "Balandra Beach is a lovely beach about 30min out of La Paz. The sand is nice and there are shelters around the beach but get there early if you want one. The water is warm and reasonablely clear but you can walk out a couple of hundred metres and still only be knee deep, so",
          "I have never seen a beach like this. The water is crystal clear and you can walk out so far and the water wont go past your waist. Get there early if you want an umbrella/palapas. There are about 20 of them and they get taken fast. Other than that there is no shade. We",
          "Breath taking beach, get there early to get a shade umbrella, we arrived around 10:30 on a tuesday. Remember bug spray as the sand flies bite a lot in the shade.",
          "We spent two days here just relaxing. A few quiet, quaint, accessible beach used by tourists and locals alike. It's not much for swimming or waves - excellent for wading, SUP/sea kayak and just enjoying the beautiful, peaceful setting. No services.. you can go to the next beach",
          "This beach is not to miss if you are in La Paz. It\u2019s not far and really great. But it gets crowded quite quickly, which can change the experience. Arrive early. And don\u2019t forget to climb on the top of the small mountain next to the beach you will be rewarded by a breath taking",
          "There are several bays and you can walk in the sea from one beach to the other. Shallow and transparent water. Lots of fishes. No services on the beach, but still it is wonderful. Must see place! You can rent a car, go by taxi or by bus from Malecon. Buses just pass every 1.5",
          "Balandra beach was my favorite beach we visited! We drove 2.5 hours from Los Cabos to go there thanks to the locals we spoke with at our resort. They all recommended Balandra for its beauty and the shallow, beautiful waters. Balandra has beautiful white sand (in complete",
          "This beach was lovely. The water was crystal clear and still as can be. We went to the section that you can only reach by boat, and it was very secluded which made for an incredibly peaceful experience. I recommend checking it out!",
          "Crowded when we visited over Easter weekend. This is a beautiful beach!! I wish it hadn\u2019t been so busy when we visited but this is a place to hang out for the day. Water is clear with lots of marine life.",
          "This is a very beautiful beach just outside of La Paz. Totally worth the drive. Pack your own snacks...no services.",
          "Spent several hours here with 6 adults and 6 children (ages 8-5 months). We brought our inflatable paddle boards and spent the day on our own private spot. Fun in the sun, snorkeling, and loving life.",
          "Love Balandra Beach. My brothers and I frequent La Paz and always spend a day or two swimming around Balandra. If you can handle the trek, keep walking to the last beach in the bay. The water is clearer, and the fish are more plentiful. For a real good swim, go from Balandra",
          "Go early in the day as it can get quite busy. Take a beach umbrella with you, there are some shade palapas but you might not get one.",
          "Really cool semi-hidden beach. The water is pretty shallow, especially when the tide is out, so you can walk pretty far out in the water.",
          "Samana Santa is a huge celebration here in the Baja sur. Everyone goes to the beach with family. Not just this beach, all beaches were packed. We got all the way there from San Jose del Cabo (2hr+ drive) and couldn\u2019t even get to the beach it was so busy. Definitely bad",
          "This place is beautiful. We were luck enough to visit when it wasn\u2019t too crowded . The second time we went there was not parking so we left and stopped by a beach closer to La Paz but no were near as nice.",
          "We visited Balandra Beach in the middle of the day. It is just as pictured - shallow water, nice beach, beautiful. BUT be forwarned: there are no toilets, no wind, no waves, no shells for beachcombers, & if you aren't lucky enough to snag a spot under an umbrella, it is just too",
          "Previous posters have summed it up quite well... Playa Balandra is a beautiful place. The various hues of blue water against a backdrop of desert mountains is stunning.",
          "Amazing beach ideal for families. You can walk forever and before the water level reaches your waist. Calm water, beautiful beach!",
          "Such an incredible beach! Get there early to snag one of the palapas on the shore. Also pay attention to tide charts because at low tide there is almost no water in the Bay, a perfect place to go at high tide.",
          "This beach is gorgeous. The water is so clear and shallow. We went in few feet and the water won\u2019t go above our waste. Just make sure you bring your own food/drinks/snacks since they don\u2019t sell anything there. Great place to relax and enjoy the view.",
          "What a gorgeous beach. I am sure by previous posts it has already been said. We got there by 9:30 and was one of three cars. We left at 1:00 and it was packed. Several vendors for a Thurs. We rented SUP for an hour. 250 pesos an hour. Go. Enjoy. Relax!",
          "Probably the nicest beach in La Paz! Go early as the crowds are minimal and the basin is filled with water. At low tide the basin practically empties out and you're left with wet sand. Located a 30 minute drive from the La Paz Malecon it can be challenging to get to but taxi",
          "My husband and I travel to Cabo at least once a year, and Balandra iso ne of our favorite spots. We rent a car and drive up from our hotel. It is a swimmable beach, which if you've been to the Cab area you know that is rare. The water is beautiful, warm and calm. IT gets busy,",
          "The Beach is beautiful, the major problem that I found is the lack of available parking lot and that there\u2019s no restrooms available; so you should guess your options available when you gotta go... hope the authorities solve this issue because this is a great place to visit in La",
          "Great beach. Get there early for shade. Walk to the mushroom walk and enjoy a serene beach. Shallow, but sparkling blue.",
          "Watch out for the bus timetable - they do their own thing. We had to hitch back. No cafe/bar - take everything you need - it\u2019s a must see.",
          "It\u2019s really like two crescent shaped bays connected to each other. You have to walk or wade to the right side to get to the iconic, mushroom shaped rock formation. At high tide we could walk across the bay at about waist depth, at very low tide it was about to knee depth. Out",
          "I was completely blown away. Our trip to Cabo is complete with our day excursion at LaPaz. Balandra Beach is simply amazing. We can't wait to come back.",
          "This is such a pretty spot. You can easily get away from the \"crowds\", we went on a Sunday, the busiest day of the week and it was still very peaceful. Safe, gorgeous, unspoiled, clean. You can take a short hike up a hill to get an amazing view. You can wade (it is very",

          "A peaceful place to spend time walking between the different beaches across from each other and next to each other. There\u2019s a total of 7 white sand beaches. No one bothers you. You need to take your own picnic",
          "We red the reviews from Trip Advisor and decided to drive out there. It was worth the drive. It was not your regular beach. One side was black rocky mountains and other side was super fine sand. Water was really shallow and light blue. You have to walk for a while to",
          "This is a beautiful beach only 15 to 20 min drive from la Paz baja, also very shallow waters.only minor problem there aren't public bathrooms but you can drive 5 mim arond the corner to coyote beach and there is a seafood restaurant bar.",
          "Awesome place to visit. Went at low tide, when you can walk for at least 300-400 feet and the water is just waist deep. Great place to take kids and specially those who love to see crabs and fish. The sunset from the hilltop is breathtaking. Besides some nice shades there are",
          "You need a car or take a tour, but this place is gorgeous. There are no services - bring your own water and snacks. Good place to let the kids go in the water because it is so shallow",
          "A must, jus be careful to take all your beach gear and food/water if you are planning to stay the day. It is a virgin beach area.",
          "Good, clean beach that stretches for ever surrounding a huge lagoon-like area of shallow sea. Excellent for relaxing or paddle-boarding",
          "A large perfect beach in a protected cove. About 20 palapas lined up on the beach (no charge). Very shallow water but we were able to use a kayak. OK snorkeling around the rocks on the other side of the cove. A bit cool in February but still swimable. It's about a 25 minute",
          "Nice virgin beach. It's like a giant pool, not deep at all. Calm water. I think it could have some ecofriendly infrastructure, it\u00b4s the only thing missing to have an excellente place",
          "Very pretty little bay, fairly clean too! Easy place to wade in the water. Had some fun helping a little fish build his house!",
          "Beautiful beach, not crowded and much cleaner than the private resort beach! Easy short drive from town",
          "I am not a beach person. I feel the need to preface this review with that statement, because I did not want to leave Balandra Beach the day we visited. It is truly one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. The enormous bay is only waist deep for hundreds of meters, and",
          "La Paz is a very industrial port city but some of the beaches are interesting because the water is clear, very shallow and walkable. It was fun to take a hike in this area that has sand dunes and some great places for pictures.",

          "Beautiful area however we went out for one hour and our camera and phone were stolen. It was super busy and we hid them in our car... I know i know... I'm in Mexico... don't leave stuff in the car but I can't exactly take everything with me out... Saddest part is all the",

          "best beach in baja shallow warm un busy would def recommend to visit about 45 mins by bus lots of other great beachs near by",
          "We recently revisted Balandra Bay after a twenty year absence. Its beauty continues to take your breath away. Its depth is only mid-calf, extending for probably a half-mile plus from shore. We were informed it is now a protected area, and we noticed how visitors were careful",
          "Must see! Climb the hill for the view. Shallow, safe, no amenities. Easy drive from La Paz. Good parking.",
          "I truly believe after going up and down the Baja, that by far this is the most amazing beach in all of Mexico. The sand is icing sugar white and soft, the water is clear clean warm and completely beyond words amazing",

          "We spent 2 days here, SUPing and swimming and wading. Breathtaking scenery and clear, beautiful water.",

          "Una playa muy bonita con aguas muy claras. Pero tengas cuidado con las medusas. Yo fui y me pico una. No hay servicios de sanitario y/o un lugar para comer. Hay mejores playas sin duda. Beautiful beach with crystal clear waters. But be careful with the jellyfish!! I went a few",
          "We drove to Balandra on one of the days staying there in La Paz. It was beautiful and the fact that you can walk out so far on low tide is fun. You can also rent kayaks and take it around. The only part that I didn't like was that from the moment you drive in, you start seeing",
          "We were there on an overcast day but it was still absolutely beautiful. Lots of tide pool critters to see and the beach was totally wadable during low tide.",
          "Balandra was probably the highlight of our trip. Absolutely gorgeous beach, pretty secluded, if youre willing to venture along the coastline you can easily find private areas where very few people are out there. Highly recommend, only complaint is we didnt bring beer!",
          "Shallow beach so you can walk out a long way. The water is no deeper than waist deep. It was easy to find and get too.",
          "at high tide, it is one of the most beautiful beaches we have ever been to. But at low tide, its not as good. Also, depending on the time of year, it can get packed with lots of locals. Be sure to climb up to the top of the overlook very carefully. Lots of loose rocks, but",
          "This place was truly amazing. The water was crystal clear with white sugar sand. The backdrop looks like a chunk of the Grand Canyon with wild cacti growing on the mounds.",
          "Beautiful spot! The four stars are only because of the weather, which was out of our control. Highly recommended as cloudy days are extremely rare.",
          "Just no words describe the beauty of this place. The Palapas have just been redone. Beach is very kid friendly. There are however no public restrooms and the trash cans seem to fill up quick.",
          "We went on a Saturday. Parking lot full, palapas taken (last time I visited there were no palapas..) Still a pretty spot, but not what it was ten years ago.",
          "One of the best beaches we visited when in Cabo. Was worth the drive of 2 hrs with screaming/hungry kids in the car. You can walk all the way across and the water would reach a little over your waist. Water is a little chilly but once you get in and with the scorching nice sun",
          "ok, everyone wants to find that special beach with white sand and crystal clear water. Well this is it. the netire bay is no more than 5 ft deep at any point and lots of fish to snorkle with as well. take food and drink as No restaurants or bars there. but 5 min away at",
          "This beach is excellent for those who can't swim well since the crystal clear water is pretty shallow. And the best part, at least for those who'd rather travel by foot than with a rental car, is that there IS a bus that goes here from La Paz's Bus Terminal (Aguilar). From",
          "This was a clean beach with free plapas if you get there early. You can walk around the rocks to the Flower Rock when the tide is low.",
          "This beach is beautiful, but the day we went there were WAY too many people. The water is calm, clear and shallow. Perfect for famililes with small children and conveniently close to town. Fortunately we found other beaches nearby that weren't as congested.",

          "Just a short 30 minute drive from La Paz, definitely the nicest beach in the area. The road is not marked very well but if you hit the ferry port you are on the right track. Nice clean shallow water, great for kids. There are many palapas on the beach but are taken by 10:30",
          "Decide to drive here from San Jose del Cabo.. maybe 3 hours (one way). Would of loved to have stayed near by for a night instead of driving back right away, lots of places I would of loved to stop at ..but we were leaving for home the next morning:( I read where people mention",

          "Hello- Good day at the beach. We are staying in Cabo so it's a drive! The waiter at the Cape recommended we go since we had a car. Be prepared - there are no close facilities/food/stores so think ahead. We only stayed about 1.5 hours because I didn't want to drive back in",
          "Perfect turquoise warm waters and white, fine sand. This is one of the most picturesque beaches we've seen and incredibly quiet. If you're in La Paz, Balandra is a must visit!",

          "This beach is very calm. I recommend it for smaller kids. Most beautiful beach I have visited in La Paz",
          "If you are in La Paz make sure you check out Balandra. One of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Completely isolated and protected beach means nothing but absolute serenity.",
          "I went there after going to Isla Espiritu Santo with On board Baja travel agency, they took us to a part of the beach that is not accessible by car or walking, so it was a more private part of the Beach. This is a very big place and the depth of the water varies a lot depending",

          "Beautiful! If you want a relaxing, photo op beach....this is it. It was an all day trip for us. We drove from San Jos\u00e9 Del Cabo and it took about 2 to 3 hours to get there. (We stopped on the way and had lunch.) There are two ways to get there from San Jos\u00e9 Del Cabo. On",
          "This is one of the beaches in Cabo for children. I have a 7 year old that was able to swim almost through the whole place in the ocean. He also did some kayaking there and visited the mushroom rock. Water was clear!!! Great place for children.",
          "We arrived around 10 am. Already, the parking lot was getting full. We found a corner for the car (Toyota Prius) but could not pull forward entirely because the spot had a huge rock. The parking was free. Already all the public umbrellas were taken. A vender offered to rent some",
          "Balandra Beach is unlike any other spot I have seen, and I've been to many of the best beaches in the world. Totally unexpected as the Pacific side of Mexico is not usually as clear and blue as the Cancun side. This place is an exception. It's like mother nature coughed up tons",
          "We took a cab out to the beach, walked along the waters edge to the beach around the point and had the beach to ourselves all day. We hiked up the hill and over the top to the little rental building where the cab dropped us off I do not recommend that hike, to many rattle",

          "This is one of the most photographed and popular beaches in La Paz, and for the Baja as well. About a 30 minute drive out the bay from the city, you wouldn't know it was there until you made the final curve. White-sand beaches, and desert-like cliffs add to the experience. A",

          "This is one of the best beaches I have experienced in Mexico. The water is calm and clear. The water level is low enough to walk across to the other side of the beach. This seems to be a favorite spot for the local - so it gets crowded with families and large groups. However,",
          "The water is so calm and blue! It was also a pretty nice temperature when we were there as well. It's also very shallow. You have to walk out really far to even get waist deep! I recommend bringing plenty of snacks, drinks, etc in a cooler so you can stay for several hours.",

          "We went mid week in late April. It was pretty quiet and a beautiful beach with a shallow, warm, clean, bright blue bag that is ideal for paddle boarding or families. Well worth the drive.",
          "It is a beautiful white sand beach, absolutely packed with families camping out for the day. Not my cup of tea, the beach in front of our hotel was just as calm and much quieter.",
          "The bay is amazing. It is mostly shallow and you can walk out into the middle of the bay. Just make sure you shuffle your feet to avoid being stung by any sting rays. Also, make sure you walk up to the mirador from the road leading to the parking lot for some amazing views",
          "It is a beautiful beach. Make sure to rent one of the umbrellas...it gets really hot and the sun is very intense. We were there on a Saturday and the crowds started showing up in the later afternoon. We took the Eco Baja Tours bus from the Malecon. It was a good price, but",
          "Beautiful beach.....too crowded for me. Beautiful water but all of the tourists go here too packed for my likings",
          "I think a visit to this beach is a must do when you are in la paz. The water is so shallow, you can walk forever without the water even touching your knees. A weird and unique experience. But this phenomenon makes this beach very popular among Mexican families with kids, so",

          "Approximately 2 and 15 min away from Cabo by car was a wonderful find in La Paz. Highly recommended if you are staying in Cabo for some time. Beach is not crowded at all during the week Water is warm tranquil so inviting to jump in. Bring your cooler with drinks as there really",

          "Balandra is about a two hour sail from La Paz. In the daytime, we anchor off the famous \"Mushroom Rock\". We swim and snorkel in crystal clear water about two fathoms deep. As always, the colorful reef fish favor the rocky areas. This is a superb area to learn standup paddle",

          "This beach is about a 30 minute car ride from La Paz. The road is being worked on so there could be some delays. Also, there is a port near there so there are lots of big trucks speeding on the two lane road. One you pass the port, then the road is less crazy. There is a parking",
          "Had heard of Balandra the same time I heard of La Paz....had very high expectations for the beach and it did NOT disappoint. Plus, it was far less touristy than I would've thought! Easy to get to either by $5 bus round trip or your own car. Beautiful, breathtaking, calm,",

          "All I can say is just plan a full day at this beach. If you can, get there at high tide and watch it go out and back in again. Walk all over, take pictures all over,take in the blues, browns, greens and crystals. If you are lucky, grab a palapa. Bus ride from town if $5 round",

        "wiki": "Tiwanaku (Spanish: Tiahuanaco or Tiahuanacu) is a Pre-Columbian archaeological site in western Bolivia near Lake Titicaca and one of the largest sites in South America. Surface remains currently cover around 4 square kilometers and include decorated ceramics, monumental structures, and megalithic blocks. The site's population probably peaked around AD 800 with 10,000 to 20,000 people.The site was first recorded in written history in 1549 by Spanish conquistador Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n while searching for the southern Inca capital of Qullasuyu.Some have hypothesized that Tiwanaku's modern name is related to the Aymara term taypiqala, meaning \"stone in the center\", alluding to the belief that it lay at the center of the world. The name by which Tiwanaku was known to its inhabitants may have been lost as they had no written language. Heggarty and Beresford-Jones suggest that the  Puquina language is most likely to have been the language of Tiwanaku.\n\n\n== Antiquity ==\nThe age of the site has been significantly refined over the last century. From 1910 to 1945, Arthur Posnansky maintained that the site was 11,000\u201317,000 years old based on comparisons to geological eras and archaeoastronomy. Beginning in the 1970s, Carlos Ponce Sangin\u00e9s proposed the site was first occupied around 1580 BC, the site's oldest radiocarbon date. This date is still seen in some publications and museums in Bolivia. Since the 1980s, researchers have recognized this date as unreliable, leading to the consensus that the site is no older than 200 or 300 BC. Most recently, a statistical assessment of reliable radiocarbon dates estimates that the site was founded around AD 110 (50\u2013170, 68% probability), a date supported by the lack of ceramic styles from earlier periods.\n\n\n== Structures ==\nThe structures that have been excavated by researchers at Tiwanaku include the Akapana, Akapana East, and Pumapunku stepped platforms, the Kalasasaya, the Kheri Kala, and Putin enclosures, and the Semi-Subterranean Temple. These may be visited by the public.\nThe Akapana is an approximately cross-shaped pyramidal structure that is 257 m wide, 197 m broad at its maximum, and 16.5 m tall. At its center appears to have been a sunken court. This was nearly destroyed by a deep looters excavation that extends from the center of this structure to its eastern side. Material from the looter's excavation was dumped off the eastern side of the Akapana. A staircase with sculptures is present on its western side. Possible residential complexes might have occupied both the northeast and southeast corners of this structure.\nOriginally, the Akapana was thought to have been developed from a modified hill. Twenty-first-century studies have shown that it is an entirely manmade earthen mound, faced with a mixture of large and small stone blocks. The dirt comprising Akapana appears to have been excavated from the \"moat\" that surrounds the site. The largest stone block within the Akapana, made of andesite, is estimated to weigh 65.7 tonnes. The structure was possibly for the shaman-puma relationship or transformation through shape shifting. Tenon puma and human heads stud the upper terraces.\n\nThe Akapana East was built on the eastern side of early Tiwanaku. Later it was considered a boundary between the ceremonial center and the urban area. It was made of a thick, prepared floor of sand and clay, which supported a group of buildings. Yellow and red clay were used in different areas for what seems like aesthetic purposes. It was swept clean of all domestic refuse, signaling its great importance to the culture.The Pumapunku is a man-made platform built on an east-west axis like the Akapana. It is a rectangular, terraced earthen mound faced with megalithic blocks. It is 167.36 m wide along its north-south axis and 116.7 m broad along its east-west axis and is 5 m tall. Identical 20-meter-wide projections extend 27.6 meters north and south from the northeast and southeast corners of the Pumapunku. Walled and unwalled courts and an esplanade are associated with this structure.\nA prominent feature of the Pumapunku is a large stone terrace; it is 6.75 by 38.72 meters in dimension and paved with large stone blocks. It is called the \"Plataforma L\u00edtica\". The Plataforma L\u00edtica contains the largest stone block found in the Tiwanaku site. According to Ponce Sangines, the block is estimated to weigh 131 metric tons. The second-largest stone block found within the Pumapunku is estimated to be 85 metric tons.\n\nThe Kalasasaya is a large courtyard more than 300 feet long, outlined by a high gateway. It is located to the north of the Akapana and west of the Semi-Subterranean Temple. Within the courtyard is where explorers found the Gateway of the Sun. Since the late 20th century, researchers have theorized that this was not the gateway's original location.\nNear the courtyard is the Semi-Subterranean Temple; a square sunken courtyard that is unique for its north-south rather than east-west axis. The walls are covered with tenon heads of many different styles, suggesting that the structure was reused for different purposes over time. It was built with walls of sandstone pillars and smaller blocks of Ashlar masonry. The largest stone block in the Kalasasaya is estimated to weigh 26.95 metric tons.Within many of the site's structures are impressive gateways; the ones of monumental scale are placed on artificial mounds, platforms, or sunken courts. Many gateways show iconography of the Staff God. This iconography also is used on some oversized vessels, indicating an importance to the culture. This iconography is most present on the Gateway of the Sun.The Gateway of the Sun and others located at Pumapunku are not complete. They are missing part of a typical recessed frame known as a chambranle, which typically have sockets for clamps to support later additions. These architectural examples, as well as the recently discovered Akapana Gate, have unique detail and demonstrate high skill in stone-cutting. This reveals a knowledge of descriptive geometry. The regularity of elements suggests they are part of a system of proportions.\n\nMany theories for the skill of Tiwanaku's architectural construction have been proposed. One is that they used a luk\u2019 a, which is a standard measurement of about sixty centimeters. Another argument is for the Pythagorean Ratio. This idea calls for right triangles at a ratio of five to four to three used in the gateways to measure all parts. Lastly, Protzen and Nair argue that Tiwanaku had a system set for individual elements dependent on context and composition. This is shown in the construction of similar gateways ranging from diminutive to monumental size, proving that scaling factors did not affect proportion. With each added element, the individual pieces were shifted to fit together.As the population grew, occupational niches developed, and people began to specialize in certain skills. There was an increase in artisans, who worked in pottery, jewelry, and textiles. Like the later Inca, the Tiwanaku had few commercial or market institutions. Instead, the culture relied on elite redistribution. That is, the elites of the empire controlled essentially all economic output but were expected to provide each commoner with all the resources needed to perform his or her function. Selected occupations include agriculturists, herders, pastoralists, etc. Such separation of occupations was accompanied by hierarchical stratification within the empire.The elites of Tiwanaku lived inside four walls that were surrounded by a moat. This moat, some believe, was to create the image of a sacred island. Inside the walls were many images devoted to human origin, which only the elites would see. Commoners may have entered this structure only for ceremonial purposes since it was home to the holiest of shrines.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\n\nAs the site has suffered from looting and amateur excavations since shortly after Tiwanaku's fall, archeologists must attempt to interpret it with the understanding that materials have been jumbled and destroyed. This destruction continued during the Spanish conquest and colonial period, and during 19th century and the early 20th century. Other damage was committed by people quarrying stone for building and railroad construction, and target practice by military personnel.\nNo standing buildings have survived at the modern site. Only public, non-domestic foundations remain, with poorly reconstructed walls. The ashlar blocks used in many of these structures were mass-produced in similar styles so that they could possibly be used for multiple purposes. Throughout the period of the site, certain buildings changed purposes, causing a mix of artifacts found today.Detailed study of Tiwanaku began on a small scale in the mid-nineteenth century. In the 1860s, Ephraim George Squier visited the ruins and later published maps and sketches completed during his visit. German geologist Alphons St\u00fcbel spent nine days in Tiwanaku in 1876, creating a map of the site based on careful measurements. He also made sketches and created paper impressions of carvings and other architectural features. A book containing major photographic documentation was published in 1892 by engineer Georg von Grumbkow, With commentary by archaeologist Max Uhle, this was the first in-depth scientific account of the ruins.\nVon Grumbkow had first visited Tiwanaku between the end of 1876 and the beginning of 1877, when he accompanied as a photographer the expedition of French adventurer Th\u00e9odore Ber, financed by American businessman Henry Meiggs, against Ber\u2019s promise of donating the artifacts he will find, on behalf of Meiggs, to Washington's Smithsonian Institution and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Ber\u2019s expedition was cut short by the violent hostility of the local population, instigated by the Catholic parish priest, but von Grumbkow\u2019s early pictures survive.\nPictures of archaeological excavations in 1903\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Contemporary excavation and restoration ===\n\nIn the 1960s, the Bolivian government initiated an effort to restore the site and reconstruct part of it. The walls of the Kalasasaya are almost all reconstructed. The original stones making up the Kalasasaya would have resembled a more \"Stonehenge\"-like style, spaced evenly apart and standing straight up. The reconstruction was not sufficiently based on research; for instance, a new wall was built around Kalasasaya. The reconstruction does not have as high quality of stonework as was present in Tiwanaku. As noted, the Gateway of the Sun, now in the Kalasasaya, is believed to have been moved from its original location.Modern, academically sound archaeological excavations were performed from 1978 through the 1990s by University of Chicago anthropologist Alan Kolata and his Bolivian counterpart, Oswaldo Rivera. Among their contributions are the rediscovery of the suka kollus, accurate dating of the civilization's growth and influence, and evidence for a drought-based collapse of the Tiwanaku civilization.\nArchaeologists such as Paul Goldstein have argued that the Tiwanaku empire ranged outside of the altiplano area and into the Moquegua Valley in Peru. Excavations at Omo settlements show signs of similar architecture characteristic of Tiwanaku, such as a temple and terraced mound. Evidence of similar types of cranial vault modification in burials between the Omo site and the main site of Tiwanaku is also being used for this argument.\n\nToday Tiwanaku has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, administered by the Bolivian government.\nRecently, the Department of Archaeology of Bolivia (DINAR, directed by Javier Escalante) has been conducting excavations on the Akapana pyramid. The Proyecto Arqueologico Pumapunku-Akapana (Pumapunku-Akapana Archaeological Project, PAPA) run by the University of Pennsylvania, has been excavating in the area surrounding the pyramid for the past few years, and also conducting Ground Penetrating Radar surveys of the area.\nIn former years, an archaeological field school offered through Harvard's Summer School Program, conducted in the residential area outside the monumental core, has provoked controversy amongst local archaeologists. The program was directed by Dr. Gary Urton, of Harvard, who was an expert on quipus, and Dr. Alexei Vranich of the University of Pennsylvania. The controversy was over allowing a team of untrained students to work on the site, even under professional supervision. It was so important that only certified professional archaeologists with documented funding were allowed access. The controversy was charged with nationalistic and political undertones. The Harvard field school lasted for three years, beginning in 2004 and ending in 2007. The project was not renewed in subsequent years, nor was permission sought to do so.\nIn 2009 state-sponsored restoration work on the Akapana pyramid was halted due to a complaint from UNESCO. The restoration had consisted of facing the pyramid with adobe, although researchers had not established this as appropriate.In 2013, marine archaeologists exploring Lake Titicaca's Khoa reef discovered an ancient ceremonial site and lifted artefacts such as a lapis lazuli and ceramic figurines, incense burners and a ceremonial medallion from the lake floor. The artifacts are representative of the lavishness of the ceremonies and the Tiwanaku culture.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBermann, Marc Lukurmata Princeton University Press (1994) ISBN 978-0-691-03359-4.\nBruhns, Karen Olsen, Ancient South America, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, c. 1994.\nGoldstein, Paul, \"Tiwanaku Temples and State Expansion: A Tiwanaku Sunken-Court Temple in Moduegua, Peru\", Latin American Antiquity, Vol. 4, No. 1 (March 1993), pp. 22\u201347, Society for American Archaeology.\nHoshower, Lisa M., Jane E.

        "wiki": "La Paz (), officially known as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8nwest\u027ea se\u02c8\u0272o\u027ea \u00f0e la \u02c8pas]; English: \"Our Lady of Peace\"), also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. With an estimated 816,044 residents as of 2020, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto, Achocalla, Viacha, and Mecapaca makes up the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 1.8 million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3 million. It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.\nThe city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the largest urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city, located on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja, with the full name of the city being Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.Control over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to La Paz de Ayacucho (meaning The Peace of Ayacucho).\n\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.\nThe satellite city of El Alto, in which the airport is located, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.\nLa Paz is located in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.\nIn July 1994, an earthquake rated at 8.2 struck just 200 miles (322 km) north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAt more than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10 \u00b0C), bordering on a tundra climate (ET). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands, located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.\nThe temperatures in the central La Paz, at 3,600 metres (11,811 feet), and in the Zona Sur (Southern Zone), at 3,250 m (10,663 ft) above sea level, are warmer (subtropical highland climate Cwb, according to the K\u00f6ppen classification).\nOwing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the diurnal temperature variation is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of 114 mm (4.5 in), and the driest is July with 8 mm (0.3 in).\nThe warmest temperature recorded was 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) and the coldest was \u221212.5 \u00b0C (9.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Main neighborhoods and zones ===\n\nSan Jorge\nLocated in the district known as Cotahuma and near Sopocachi, is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like Deloitte, Bank of America, Ernst & Young, BBVA and the famous Ritz Hotel. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only intelligent building of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Germany and Spain. The offices of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the CAF \u2013 Development Bank of Latin America, the Goethe Institut, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Dante Alighieri Society are also located in this modern neighborhood.Sopocachi\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.San Pedro\nLocated in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the \"Plaza de San Pedro\" (official name: Plaza Sucre, Sucre Square), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's \"Rodriguez Market\" remains as one of the most popular middle-class and oldest of the city. The San Pedro prison is here.Centro\nThe city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as \"Prado Avenue\"), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue \u2014 the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.\nCasco Viejo\nLocated in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the Central Bank of Bolivia. In the Old Quarter is the Plaza Murillo, which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.\nMiraflores\nIn the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (Parque Urbano Central, \"Central Urban Park\") and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s's faculty of medicine), hospitals and the Estadio Hernando Siles (capacity of 45,000 people).Northern District\nLocated in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecer\u00eda Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the autopista (highway).Southern District\nIn the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, Calacoto, La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like Moody's, Citibank, Aon Corporation, Huawei, Millicom International Cellular, Nissan Motor Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Pan American Silver Corporation, a Sumitomo Corporation branch, Ernst & Young, and the \"MegaCenter\", La Paz's biggest shopping mall.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Colonial architecture ==\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. \nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. \nHistorically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\n\n\n== Sports ==\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\n\nClub Bolivar : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country.

Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (Burnt Palace) as it has been on fire several times.

Two local companies offer cable television service as Multivision and Cotel TV.\n\n\n== Water supply ==\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9 km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from October 12, 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\nAdditionally, agreement was reached by Twin Cities with:\n\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAlcides Arguedas (1879-1946), writer and philosopher\nYolanda Bedregal (1916-1999), poet and poet, known as  Yolanda de Bolivia \nRodolfo Illanes (1958-2016), lawyer and politician\nCarlos Mesa (born 1953), former president of Bolivia\nV\u00edctor Montoya (born 1958), writer\nDaniel Nu\u00f1ez del Prado (1840-1891), Secretary of State, freedom fighter and doctor\nWilfred von Oven (1912-2008), press officer at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, Journalist\nVerona Pooth born,  Feldbusch  (born 1968), German presenter and businesswoman\nAndr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz (1792-1865), President of Peru and Bolivia\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas (1925-2005), lawyer, politician and former President of Bolivia\nAlberto Villalpando (born 1940), composer\nEmilio Villanueva (1882-1970), architect\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPace\u00f1a\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMunicipality of La Paz\nWeather in La Paz\nBolivia Weekly",

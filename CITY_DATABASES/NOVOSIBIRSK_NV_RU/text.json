          "We went to this zoo in December and loved it! The animals are very close to you (much closer than we are used to in American zoos), and because it was cold, they were very active. We only had 2 hours, so we ran to see the polar bear, the tigers, and the lions. I wish we had",
          "Truly worthwhile a visit. The zoo has large territory for a nice half-a-day walk. Many large \"cats\" live there. But the favorites are the family of white bears.",
          "Nice zoo with a lot of animals that we (I am from Brazil) are not used to see in our country! For example, the beautiful Ligre, wolves, and polar bear!! There was a big bonfire right in the entrance, to keep visitors warm. I would go again if I had the chance !",
          "I recently moved to Novosibirsk to teach English. My wife and I visited the zoo on our day off and we didn't have time to see it all. It's all surrounded by forests with walking paths making it beautiful in the fall weather. Huge variety of animals too. I can't wait to try",
          "There are many train wagoons exhibited, each of which tells a different story. The only problem was the timing of the visit, which was right after a 30-hour Trans-Siberian ride, and I was sick of inner atmosphere of trains!",
          "Being one or the only location in the world with new feline species. A lion mixed with a leopard for example.",
          "All the animals looked well fed and clean but some looked as tho they would of had bigger pens . Plenty to see .",
          "I never imagined myself going to a zoo in the middle of Siberia but that was rather fun! It was a bit odd to be among a lot of russian children, but I saw a lot of animal which are rare in my home country.",
          "Definitely best in Russia. Must for visit in Novosibirsk. Zoo is very large. It will take whole day there if you want to see all animals. There are places to eat just prepared Shashlyk for nice price. But it should be visited in Summer because in winter many animals live in warm",
          "Arguably the best zoo in Russia. Huge, with large spaces for animals and the feel that You are actually out in nature reserve rather than in zoo... Must visit!",
          "This is a must see when visiting Novosibirsk in the summer. One of the most impressive zoos I've ever seen. Be sure to allow ample time. It really takes several hours to see and enjoy everything!",
          "I love this ZOO. It is really easy to spend whole day there. There are a lot of animals. The greatest collection of felines. Beautiful ligar (hybride of lion and tiger). the only one thing it is not a good idea to come there during the lunch time with children. There are not",
          "The best place to visit the zoo is sunny weekend in the summer. Area is very big so make sure to have plenty of time in order to see all of the animals. Number of species is great indeed. Some animals are allowed to be fed. On the territory there are several places where you can",
          "Wow...amazing how people rave about how great this zoo is! Yes, some of the exhibits are pretty awesome and the grounds are simply gorgeous. HOWEVER, keeping a giant bear the size of an oversized truck is downright cruel!!!!!!!! The polar bears did not exactly look happy on lame",
          "I have been visiting the zoo for over ten years now, taking groups of children. It is a great place and has improved tremendously over the years. It now has new reception buildings and great facilities. The animals are well looked after and in spacious facilities. It has a",
          "it was really big, clean, with great variety of animals, didnt expect to find such a sightsee here in Siberia, visit Novosib only for the Zoo))))",
          "Great open space with comfortable cages and good views of the whole variety of exotic and local wildlife",
          "I wasn't expecting the settlers kept in such a good condition. A very good opportunity to visit liger, snow leopard and other original wild animals.",
          "If you came to Nsk in summer, this will be the point of visiting. Many animals and birds, rich amphibian collection and,of course Ligr! The hybrid of tiger and lion. Beautiful and calm place.",
          "This is definitely one of the best zoos I have ever been to (and I have been to very many). The animals here are unique and very interesting. The rules for feeding animals are very poor with many people feeding them lollies and ice cream. A few children were feeding the bears,",
          "It was a great place to spend during the sunny afternoon. The gounds are well looked after and you feel the community spirit when looking at animals upkeep. Great settings, you feel more like in a park.",
          "Not that I've seen many zoos live, but I've read of and seen on TV many of them. So I can assure you that you should vist this one even if you were to NY or London zoos just for comparison. And if you haven't visited NY, London or Moscow zoos, then you jast have to visit this to",
          "There are many different animals and attractions. The park with a Zoo is large. It is situated in a great place on a very large square.",
          "This zoo is surprisingly well kept and is a great place to spend an afternoon (on a summer day) with your partner or kids. Whereas not a must-see this place clearly provides a great environment for relaxation after a potentially stressful city tour in Novosibirsk. PS: they have",
          "Huge territory, amazing decorations. Lots of species, some of them are extremely rare. Strongly recommended:).",
          "There are \"ligras\" - mix of lion and tiger and even \"liligras\" = lion+ligra. White beers swimming pool is really great - they make real attraction with empty plastic 10-litres bottles.",
          "the zoo is easy to find and a nice escape from the city if you have an hour or two. cages feel like cages and seem small, but there's a huge range of animals. there are buildings where they host the animals that can't take the cold, and i went into 2: one was great, with the",
          "You will see polar bears who stand-up and clap 'hands' for an ice-cream that visitors drop to them. You will see and if lucky hear lions. Monkeys are so funny that not only your children but most likely you as well will spend half an hour laughing at them. White tigers,",
          "They have an incredible habitat for primates. The polar bears are awesome and so are the tiger/lions!!! It is a wonderful zoo.",
          "Beautiful place for walking with children. Big area. Lions, white bears, elephants and other animals and birds are there.",
          "There are a lot of animals(snow tigers, ligers,polar bears, monkey, etc.) and cafes, artificial waterfall, sculptures of dinozaures, carussels. The best time to visit Zoo - is summer. If you will go walk through dendropark, you will stay at the bank of the river Ob, where you",
          "As a plus, I have to say that there are a lot of animals you won't find often (said from a Westerner's perspective) -- they also have a lot of Siberian animals, which is interesting. BUT the living conditions of the animals are terrible, for most of them cages are too small",
          "The zoo is great to say the least, saw polar bears and brown bears... which I wanted to see so badly. Zoo has amazing animals, you wont be disappointed. But the only draw back is the cages, trying to get q good picture with out he cage in front is really hard. I eventually leant",
          "An extensive zoo with plenty to see, including countless species I'd never seen or even heard of, and cotton candy bigger than my head for 50 rubles. Unfortunately both the Siberian tiger and the liger were nowhere to be found (sleeping inside their enclosures, perhaps?) which",
          "I visited with a group of students from the University and we had a lot of fun walking through the zoo. It was interesting to see familiar animals to me that seemed exotic to my Russian friends and animals that I had little experience with seem common place to them. There was",
          "this place is great! It's out of the way, yet easily accessible by public transport, the grounds are so vast, you wouldn't be surprised to find out that you've been there all day and haven't seen everything yet! Food stands and summer cafes are dotted all around the place,",
          "It seemed like the animals were in distress, shaking their heads back and forth pacing themselves up and down. Small cages? They should go to LA in the states and get a real understanding of what a zoo means. Throwing human food and rubbish into the polar bears enclosure making",
          "Really felt like i was out in the nature although i was in a big city. This zoo had nothing to be jealus of the London's one. White bears were the best)))",
          "Maybe it is fun to go with other people, but it is not a particularly interesting or fun place to go as a solo traveler.",
          "It was one of the first places my husband and I went to in Novosibirsk. We did enjoy our day there. Animals seemed happy there. Though I wish the brown bears could have biger cages. Polar bears are the real stars :-) Almost all the attention of tourists belongs to them. If you",
          "Great place to come to relax and go for a stroll. There a lot to see, also there are many food stands and little cafes.",
          "It's the first place which came to my mind when I'm asked, \"What is worthwhile to see in Novosibirsk?\" A lot of animals. Polar bears are really funny, \"ligr\", the cross-breed of lion and tiger, is unique. You'll enjoy the walk along spacious open-air cages, swan lake and so on.",
          "This is a #1 attraction in Novosibirsk without any doubts! This is one of a very few real world class places in the city. It's well planned and located inside a well preserved natural forest (looks beautiful in any season!), has a lot of animals and they have plenty of space so",
          "I am not a fan of zoos, and didn't plan to go originally but this seemed one of the main attractions in Novosibirsk. I did not have time to see all the zoo, but a lot of it was well laid out with larger cages than sometimes. The polar bears are spectacular but it's still sad to",
          "I can't say that I have been to many zoos but I was very impressed with this one. I don't think I was able to see all the animals and birds - there were just too many. Pretty views, lots of flowers. So many things for kids to do - like canoe ride. You can see the animals so",
          "the zoo was very nice even in the cold of late autumn (Nov 1,2009) Enjoyed the zoo very much here are some photos below becarefull walking as it is very icing in the winter I guess in the sumeer and warm months this would be alot better",
          "Big Zoo with many animals, liger (lion+tiger), white tiger (something awsome)",
          "The Novosibirsk zoo is a great place for families! The zoo features many species of animals. They even have a liger! The zoo is large and includes an indoor exibit. The zoo itself is very clean and animals are kept in great condition. I really enjoyed myself there. Outside"

Located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River, it is the third-most populous city in Russia (after Moscow and St. Petersburg) as well as the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,612,833 as of the 2018 census.Novosibirsk was founded in 1893 on the Ob River crossing point of the future Trans-Siberian Railway. Originally named Novonikolayevsk, it grew rapidly into a major transport, commercial and industrial hub. The city was ravaged by the Russian Civil War but recovered during the early Soviet period, and gained its present name in 1926. Under Stalin, Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of World War II the city hosted many factories relocated from European Russia.\nNovosibirsk is home to the headquarters of numerous Russian corporations, as well as the world-renowned Novosibirsk Zoo. It is served by Tolmachevo Airport, the busiest airport in Siberia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNovosibirsk, founded in 1893 at the future site of a Trans-Siberian Railway bridge crossing the great Siberian river of Ob, was at first named Novonikolayevsk (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a), in honor both of Saint Nicholas and of the reigning Tsar Nicholas II. It superseded nearby Krivoshchekovskaya village, which was founded in 1696. The bridge was completed in the spring of 1897, making the new settlement the regional transport hub. The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway in the early 20th century. The new railway connected Novonikolayevsk to Central Asia and the Caspian Sea.At the time of the bridge's opening, Novonikolayevsk had a population of 7,800 people. The frontier settlement developed rapidly. Its first bank opened in 1906, and a total of five banks were operating by 1915. In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the pre-revolutionary period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000. The city had steady and rapid economic growth, becoming one of the largest commercial and industrial centers of Siberia. It developed a significant agricultural processing industry, as well as a power station, iron foundry, commodity market, several banks, and commercial and shipping companies. By 1917, seven Orthodox churches and one Roman Catholic Church had been built there, along with several cinemas, forty primary schools, a high school, a teaching seminary, and the Romanov House non-classical secondary school. In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.The Russian Civil War took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially that of typhus and cholera, claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city's history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the White Guards, captured Novonikolayevsk. The Red Army took the city in 1919, retaining it throughout the rest of the Civil War.Novonikolayevsk began reconstruction in 1921 at the start of Lenin's New Economic Policy period. It was a part of Tomsk Governorate and served as its administrative center from December 23, 1919 to March 14, 1920. Between June 13, 1921 and May 25, 1925, it served as the administrative center of Novonikolayevsk Governorate, which was separated from Tomsk Governorate. The city was given its present name on September 12, 1926.When governorates were abolished, the city served as the administrative center of Siberian Krai until July 23, 1930, and of West Siberian Krai until September 28, 1937, when that krai was split into Novosibirsk Oblast and Altai Krai. Since then, it has served as the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast.The Monument to the Heroes of the Revolution was erected in the center of the city and has been one of the chief historic sites (essentially every child had to visit the monument on school field trips during the Soviet years). Neglect in the 1990s while other areas were redeveloped helped preserve it in the post-Soviet era.During Joseph Stalin's industrialization effort, Novosibirsk secured its place as one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Several massive industrial facilities were created, including the 'Sibkombain' plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally a metal processing plant, a food processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new power station. The great Soviet famine of 1932\u201333 resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk. They were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city, giving rise to slums.Its rapid growth and industrialization led to Novosibirsk being nicknamed the \"Chicago of Siberia\".Tram rails were laid down in 1934, by which time the population had reached 287,000, making Novosibirsk the largest city in Siberia. The following year the original bridge over the Ob River was replaced by the new Kommunalny bridge.Between 1941 and 1942 more than 50 substantial factories were crated up and relocated from western Russia to Novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through war, and at this time the city became a major supply base for the Red Army. During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.\nThe rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 400 megawatts, necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the Ob Sea. As a direct result of the station's construction, vast areas of fertile land were flooded as were relic pine woods in the area; additionally, the new open space created by the reservoir's surface caused average wind speeds to double, increasing the rate of soil erosion.In the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed that a center for scientific research be built in Novosibirsk, and in 1957 the multi-facility scientific research complex of Akademgorodok was constructed about 30 km (19 mi) south of the city center. The Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (formerly the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them Novosibirsk State University, one of the top Russian schools in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.\nOn September 2, 1962, the population of Novosibirsk reached one million. At that time, it was the youngest city in the world with over a million people. Novosibirsk took fewer than seventy years to achieve this milestone.In 1979, work began on the Novosibirsk Metro Transit System, culminating in the opening of the first line in 1985.On August 1, 2008, Novosibirsk was in the center of the path of a solar eclipse, with a duration of 2 minutes and 20 seconds.\nThe city appeared in the 2019 game Metro Exodus.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nNovosibirsk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Novosibirsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Novosibirsk\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Novosibirsk is incorporated as Novosibirsk Urban Okrug.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nDzerzhinsky (\u0414\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKalininsky (\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKirovsky (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nLeninsky (\u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nOktyabrsky (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nPervomaysky (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nSovetsky (\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nTsentralny (\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439)\nZayeltsovsky (\u0417\u0430\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nZheleznodorozhny (\u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the Federal State Statistics Service, in January 2015 the number of residents came to 1,567,087. This is an increase compared to the 2010 census, when the population of the city was 1,473,754.People from over eighty ethnicities and nationalities reside in Novosibirsk. The largest groups are Russian, Yakut, German, Ukrainian, Tatar, Jewish, and Belarusian.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe best-known trees native to Novosibirsk are birch, pine, and aspen. Some mountain ash, hawthorn, spruce, and fir are also present. European species of apple, ash, elm, linden, and oak have been successfully introduced.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe city stands on the banks of the Ob River in the West Siberian Plain. To the south of the city lies the Priobskoye Plateau. The nearest major cities are Krasnoyarsk, Omsk and Nur-Sultan.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in Novosibirsk is typical of Siberia, with dry winters and far-below-freezing winter temperatures. The reason for these temperatures is the absence of a nearby ocean, the Ural Mountains barring Atlantic air masses from reaching Siberia, and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds. In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being \u00dcr\u00fcmqi in China.\nThe climate is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Novosibirsk is frequently cloudy in the winter due to the collision of Atlantic and Siberian air masses. Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from +15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) to +26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and in winter from \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) to \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F). However, winter temperatures can go as low as \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F) to \u221235 \u00b0C (\u221231 \u00b0F), and summer temperatures can go as high as +30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) to +35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The difference between the highest- and lowest-recorded temperatures is 82 \u00b0C (148 \u00b0F).\nTravellers coming from countries with mild climates may find Novosibirsk's winter tough, but it may not be extraordinary for those from northern countries. At times, bitter cold may hold for some days, but temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and lower do not occur every year.\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\nNovosibirsk is home to Russia's most powerful shortwave relay station east of the Ural mountains. This relay station can reach most of South Asia, the Middle East, and China. The Magadan and Vladivostok relay stations when operated in conjunction with Novosibirsk can guarantee that the Voice of Russia or any other broadcaster renting time at Novosibirsk is heard in the intended target area.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== International and intercity transportation ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nThe city is served by Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport. Tolmachevo is the hub for S7 Airlines. There is also the auxiliary Yeltsovka Airport. A smaller field for general aviation at Novosibirsk Severny Airport was closed in 2012.\nThe many regular flights from Tolmachevo Airport connect Novosibirsk with most Russian largest cities and most countries of Europe and Asia.\n\n\n==== Railway stations ====\n\nNovosibirsk is a major stop on the Trans-Siberian Railway and the north end of Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway. The main railway station of Novosibirsk is Novosibirsk-Glavny station (\"Glavny\" means \"Main\") which is located in the centre of the right bank part of the city. There are also Novosibirsk-Zapadny (\"Zapadny\" means \"Western\"), Novosibirsk-Vostochny (\"Vostochny\" means \"Eastern\"), and Novosibirsk-Yuzhny (\"Yuzhny\" means \"Southern\") railway stations in Novosibirsk. All intercity trains passing through the aforementioned stations stop at these stations. In addition, there are halts where only suburban trains stops, for example Inskaya, Seyatel, Razyezd Inya, and many others.\nThe many regular intercity trains connect Novosibirsk with Russian cities in Siberia, the Far East, Ural, and European Russia. International trains allow to get to China, Mongolia, Belarus, and countries in Central Asia.\n\n\n==== Bus stations ====\nThe old Novosibirsk Bus Station located on Krasny Avenue in the right bank part of the city near Kommunalny Bridge was opened in 1964 and eventually closed on 6 April 2020. There is a plan to build some new bus stations on the periphery of the city; the first of these new bus stations was built on Gusinobrodskoe \u0421haussee and was opened on 18 December 2019. Until the completion of remaining new bus stations, some bus stops in the city are being used by intercity bus services.\nThe many regular intercity/international bus routes connect Novosibirsk with most cities of the southern part of Western Siberia and major cities of Central Asia.\n\n\n==== River passenger terminals ====\nThe building of Novosibirsk river passenger terminal (Russian: \u0420\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043b) on the Ob river was opened in 1974.

          "This open air railway museum is quite big and we didn\u2019t manage to cover all. We enjoyed having the opportunity to get into a few of the trains which gave us a glimpse of the different class of cabins of the old days n personally I find the hospital train to be pretty",
          "Easily found close to the railway station, but is palaver to get in, we were the first visitors that day (at 3:30pm), but very interesting when inside. No English translation but the proprietor tries to explain as best he can. A must do if doing the TSR",
          "Trains everywhere. If you are a train lover like me, this is a place for you. Somewhat not too advertised, but a lovely attraction.",
          "I'm a local, and I love this trains museum! I see how it can be inconvenient to visit if you are staying downtown, but get this: the museum is just a short while away from Akademgorok, the scientific neighborhood of Novosibirsk that definitely worth at least a day visit on its",
          "It happened to rain the day we visited the railway museum and as its outdoors we didn't stay too long, but the history is evident of how Russia is made somewhat closer amidst its nine time zones! The railway is critical for any discovery in Russia...it takes longer but there's",
          "The railway museum is wonderful. The engines are enormous and extremely impressive, also the variety of different kinds of wagons, and the number of engines and wagons. There is also a fine collection of cars and lorries from the 1950's and 1960's. This museum is of enormous",

          "You need to travel to Akademgorodok from dowtown of Novosibirsk to visit this museum. It is about 25 km ride on taxi, bus or local train. Meseum is very easy to find, it is located just along the main road from Novosibirsk to Akademgorodok. Prices are reasonable,but you need to",
          "In truth was disappointed with this railway museum. It is a long way out of town and consists of Russian trains parked outdoors one behind the other. Apart from the trains themselves, no interactive display and no real information available. As a rail enthusiast (we did visit",

          "This place has an amazing collection of trains and engines which cover the historical periods of train travel in Russia. Try to book in advance and arrange a guide to learn more. Also the museum is open air and about 30 mins outside the city. More than 150 locos and carriages,",

          "It is a good experience! I've never seen such a variety of old trains in one place. This museum offers to try some caragies inside. You'll see medical one and luxury suite, etc. If you have some time in Novosibirsk you should visit this place. PS: there are an excibition of old",
          "The only complaint here is that the wagons are restricted to \"excursion\" groups which means if you just arrive to have a look, you will need to be happy looking from outside. Other than that it's interesting and easy to get to (it's joined to a part of an existing train station)",
          "Learn a little about the history of the locomotives, the carriages of the TSR. We did specifically want to see carriages and locomotives from the Civil War period, non of which were on display, however there were some carriages from early 1900's. The prisoner carriage",

Located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River, it is the third-most populous city in Russia (after Moscow and St. Petersburg) as well as the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,612,833 as of the 2018 census.Novosibirsk was founded in 1893 on the Ob River crossing point of the future Trans-Siberian Railway. Originally named Novonikolayevsk, it grew rapidly into a major transport, commercial and industrial hub. The city was ravaged by the Russian Civil War but recovered during the early Soviet period, and gained its present name in 1926. Under Stalin, Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of World War II the city hosted many factories relocated from European Russia.\nNovosibirsk is home to the headquarters of numerous Russian corporations, as well as the world-renowned Novosibirsk Zoo. It is served by Tolmachevo Airport, the busiest airport in Siberia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNovosibirsk, founded in 1893 at the future site of a Trans-Siberian Railway bridge crossing the great Siberian river of Ob, was at first named Novonikolayevsk (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a), in honor both of Saint Nicholas and of the reigning Tsar Nicholas II. It superseded nearby Krivoshchekovskaya village, which was founded in 1696. The bridge was completed in the spring of 1897, making the new settlement the regional transport hub. The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway in the early 20th century. The new railway connected Novonikolayevsk to Central Asia and the Caspian Sea.At the time of the bridge's opening, Novonikolayevsk had a population of 7,800 people. The frontier settlement developed rapidly. Its first bank opened in 1906, and a total of five banks were operating by 1915. In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the pre-revolutionary period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000. The city had steady and rapid economic growth, becoming one of the largest commercial and industrial centers of Siberia. It developed a significant agricultural processing industry, as well as a power station, iron foundry, commodity market, several banks, and commercial and shipping companies. By 1917, seven Orthodox churches and one Roman Catholic Church had been built there, along with several cinemas, forty primary schools, a high school, a teaching seminary, and the Romanov House non-classical secondary school. In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.The Russian Civil War took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially that of typhus and cholera, claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city's history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the White Guards, captured Novonikolayevsk. The Red Army took the city in 1919, retaining it throughout the rest of the Civil War.Novonikolayevsk began reconstruction in 1921 at the start of Lenin's New Economic Policy period. It was a part of Tomsk Governorate and served as its administrative center from December 23, 1919 to March 14, 1920. Between June 13, 1921 and May 25, 1925, it served as the administrative center of Novonikolayevsk Governorate, which was separated from Tomsk Governorate. The city was given its present name on September 12, 1926.When governorates were abolished, the city served as the administrative center of Siberian Krai until July 23, 1930, and of West Siberian Krai until September 28, 1937, when that krai was split into Novosibirsk Oblast and Altai Krai. Since then, it has served as the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast.The Monument to the Heroes of the Revolution was erected in the center of the city and has been one of the chief historic sites (essentially every child had to visit the monument on school field trips during the Soviet years). Neglect in the 1990s while other areas were redeveloped helped preserve it in the post-Soviet era.During Joseph Stalin's industrialization effort, Novosibirsk secured its place as one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Several massive industrial facilities were created, including the 'Sibkombain' plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally a metal processing plant, a food processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new power station. The great Soviet famine of 1932\u201333 resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk. They were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city, giving rise to slums.Its rapid growth and industrialization led to Novosibirsk being nicknamed the \"Chicago of Siberia\".Tram rails were laid down in 1934, by which time the population had reached 287,000, making Novosibirsk the largest city in Siberia. The following year the original bridge over the Ob River was replaced by the new Kommunalny bridge.Between 1941 and 1942 more than 50 substantial factories were crated up and relocated from western Russia to Novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through war, and at this time the city became a major supply base for the Red Army. During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.\nThe rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 400 megawatts, necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the Ob Sea. As a direct result of the station's construction, vast areas of fertile land were flooded as were relic pine woods in the area; additionally, the new open space created by the reservoir's surface caused average wind speeds to double, increasing the rate of soil erosion.In the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed that a center for scientific research be built in Novosibirsk, and in 1957 the multi-facility scientific research complex of Akademgorodok was constructed about 30 km (19 mi) south of the city center. The Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (formerly the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them Novosibirsk State University, one of the top Russian schools in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.\nOn September 2, 1962, the population of Novosibirsk reached one million. At that time, it was the youngest city in the world with over a million people. Novosibirsk took fewer than seventy years to achieve this milestone.In 1979, work began on the Novosibirsk Metro Transit System, culminating in the opening of the first line in 1985.On August 1, 2008, Novosibirsk was in the center of the path of a solar eclipse, with a duration of 2 minutes and 20 seconds.\nThe city appeared in the 2019 game Metro Exodus.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nNovosibirsk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Novosibirsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Novosibirsk\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Novosibirsk is incorporated as Novosibirsk Urban Okrug.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nDzerzhinsky (\u0414\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKalininsky (\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKirovsky (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nLeninsky (\u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nOktyabrsky (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nPervomaysky (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nSovetsky (\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nTsentralny (\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439)\nZayeltsovsky (\u0417\u0430\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nZheleznodorozhny (\u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the Federal State Statistics Service, in January 2015 the number of residents came to 1,567,087. This is an increase compared to the 2010 census, when the population of the city was 1,473,754.People from over eighty ethnicities and nationalities reside in Novosibirsk. The largest groups are Russian, Yakut, German, Ukrainian, Tatar, Jewish, and Belarusian.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe best-known trees native to Novosibirsk are birch, pine, and aspen. Some mountain ash, hawthorn, spruce, and fir are also present. European species of apple, ash, elm, linden, and oak have been successfully introduced.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe city stands on the banks of the Ob River in the West Siberian Plain. To the south of the city lies the Priobskoye Plateau. The nearest major cities are Krasnoyarsk, Omsk and Nur-Sultan.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in Novosibirsk is typical of Siberia, with dry winters and far-below-freezing winter temperatures. The reason for these temperatures is the absence of a nearby ocean, the Ural Mountains barring Atlantic air masses from reaching Siberia, and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds. In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being \u00dcr\u00fcmqi in China.\nThe climate is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Novosibirsk is frequently cloudy in the winter due to the collision of Atlantic and Siberian air masses. Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from +15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) to +26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and in winter from \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) to \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F). However, winter temperatures can go as low as \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F) to \u221235 \u00b0C (\u221231 \u00b0F), and summer temperatures can go as high as +30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) to +35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The difference between the highest- and lowest-recorded temperatures is 82 \u00b0C (148 \u00b0F).\nTravellers coming from countries with mild climates may find Novosibirsk's winter tough, but it may not be extraordinary for those from northern countries. At times, bitter cold may hold for some days, but temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and lower do not occur every year.\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\nNovosibirsk is home to Russia's most powerful shortwave relay station east of the Ural mountains. This relay station can reach most of South Asia, the Middle East, and China. The Magadan and Vladivostok relay stations when operated in conjunction with Novosibirsk can guarantee that the Voice of Russia or any other broadcaster renting time at Novosibirsk is heard in the intended target area.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== International and intercity transportation ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nThe city is served by Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport.

          "A good collection of paintings by Western European artists, Russian artists. The Soviet period is well represented. You can go to the gallery only for the sake of Roerich. Contemporary art ..... not for everybody. \u2026",

          "The area in front of the globe is pleasant for walking\n\n",
          "Was at the Van Gogh media show. I have never been to exhibitions of this format. Navigation to the picture, the supervising system that tells when, where and at what life events this or that work was written. Loved it \u2026",
          "Just a good museum in which interesting work, what else to say ...\n\n",

          "You can enjoy historic art works comfortably\n\n",
          "I really liked it. Cleanliness is everywhere. A lot of rangers. They are strict, but I think the museum should be so ...\n\n",
          "I like the collection of Russian painting. There are many not very famous paintings by famous artists: Levitan, Repin, Vasnetsov, Kuindzhi and others. It can be seen that the technique is different for everyone. \u2026",

Located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River, it is the third-most populous city in Russia (after Moscow and St. Petersburg) as well as the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,612,833 as of the 2018 census.Novosibirsk was founded in 1893 on the Ob River crossing point of the future Trans-Siberian Railway. Originally named Novonikolayevsk, it grew rapidly into a major transport, commercial and industrial hub. The city was ravaged by the Russian Civil War but recovered during the early Soviet period, and gained its present name in 1926. Under Stalin, Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of World War II the city hosted many factories relocated from European Russia.\nNovosibirsk is home to the headquarters of numerous Russian corporations, as well as the world-renowned Novosibirsk Zoo. It is served by Tolmachevo Airport, the busiest airport in Siberia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNovosibirsk, founded in 1893 at the future site of a Trans-Siberian Railway bridge crossing the great Siberian river of Ob, was at first named Novonikolayevsk (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a), in honor both of Saint Nicholas and of the reigning Tsar Nicholas II. It superseded nearby Krivoshchekovskaya village, which was founded in 1696. The bridge was completed in the spring of 1897, making the new settlement the regional transport hub. The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway in the early 20th century. The new railway connected Novonikolayevsk to Central Asia and the Caspian Sea.At the time of the bridge's opening, Novonikolayevsk had a population of 7,800 people. The frontier settlement developed rapidly. Its first bank opened in 1906, and a total of five banks were operating by 1915. In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the pre-revolutionary period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000. The city had steady and rapid economic growth, becoming one of the largest commercial and industrial centers of Siberia. It developed a significant agricultural processing industry, as well as a power station, iron foundry, commodity market, several banks, and commercial and shipping companies. By 1917, seven Orthodox churches and one Roman Catholic Church had been built there, along with several cinemas, forty primary schools, a high school, a teaching seminary, and the Romanov House non-classical secondary school. In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.The Russian Civil War took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially that of typhus and cholera, claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city's history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the White Guards, captured Novonikolayevsk. The Red Army took the city in 1919, retaining it throughout the rest of the Civil War.Novonikolayevsk began reconstruction in 1921 at the start of Lenin's New Economic Policy period. It was a part of Tomsk Governorate and served as its administrative center from December 23, 1919 to March 14, 1920. Between June 13, 1921 and May 25, 1925, it served as the administrative center of Novonikolayevsk Governorate, which was separated from Tomsk Governorate. The city was given its present name on September 12, 1926.When governorates were abolished, the city served as the administrative center of Siberian Krai until July 23, 1930, and of West Siberian Krai until September 28, 1937, when that krai was split into Novosibirsk Oblast and Altai Krai. Since then, it has served as the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast.The Monument to the Heroes of the Revolution was erected in the center of the city and has been one of the chief historic sites (essentially every child had to visit the monument on school field trips during the Soviet years). Neglect in the 1990s while other areas were redeveloped helped preserve it in the post-Soviet era.During Joseph Stalin's industrialization effort, Novosibirsk secured its place as one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Several massive industrial facilities were created, including the 'Sibkombain' plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally a metal processing plant, a food processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new power station. The great Soviet famine of 1932\u201333 resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk. They were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city, giving rise to slums.Its rapid growth and industrialization led to Novosibirsk being nicknamed the \"Chicago of Siberia\".Tram rails were laid down in 1934, by which time the population had reached 287,000, making Novosibirsk the largest city in Siberia. The following year the original bridge over the Ob River was replaced by the new Kommunalny bridge.Between 1941 and 1942 more than 50 substantial factories were crated up and relocated from western Russia to Novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through war, and at this time the city became a major supply base for the Red Army. During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.\nThe rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 400 megawatts, necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the Ob Sea. As a direct result of the station's construction, vast areas of fertile land were flooded as were relic pine woods in the area; additionally, the new open space created by the reservoir's surface caused average wind speeds to double, increasing the rate of soil erosion.In the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed that a center for scientific research be built in Novosibirsk, and in 1957 the multi-facility scientific research complex of Akademgorodok was constructed about 30 km (19 mi) south of the city center. The Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (formerly the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them Novosibirsk State University, one of the top Russian schools in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.\nOn September 2, 1962, the population of Novosibirsk reached one million. At that time, it was the youngest city in the world with over a million people. Novosibirsk took fewer than seventy years to achieve this milestone.In 1979, work began on the Novosibirsk Metro Transit System, culminating in the opening of the first line in 1985.On August 1, 2008, Novosibirsk was in the center of the path of a solar eclipse, with a duration of 2 minutes and 20 seconds.\nThe city appeared in the 2019 game Metro Exodus.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nNovosibirsk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Novosibirsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Novosibirsk\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Novosibirsk is incorporated as Novosibirsk Urban Okrug.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nDzerzhinsky (\u0414\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKalininsky (\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKirovsky (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nLeninsky (\u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nOktyabrsky (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nPervomaysky (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nSovetsky (\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nTsentralny (\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439)\nZayeltsovsky (\u0417\u0430\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nZheleznodorozhny (\u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the Federal State Statistics Service, in January 2015 the number of residents came to 1,567,087. This is an increase compared to the 2010 census, when the population of the city was 1,473,754.People from over eighty ethnicities and nationalities reside in Novosibirsk. The largest groups are Russian, Yakut, German, Ukrainian, Tatar, Jewish, and Belarusian.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe best-known trees native to Novosibirsk are birch, pine, and aspen. Some mountain ash, hawthorn, spruce, and fir are also present. European species of apple, ash, elm, linden, and oak have been successfully introduced.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe city stands on the banks of the Ob River in the West Siberian Plain. To the south of the city lies the Priobskoye Plateau. The nearest major cities are Krasnoyarsk, Omsk and Nur-Sultan.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in Novosibirsk is typical of Siberia, with dry winters and far-below-freezing winter temperatures. The reason for these temperatures is the absence of a nearby ocean, the Ural Mountains barring Atlantic air masses from reaching Siberia, and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds. In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being \u00dcr\u00fcmqi in China.\nThe climate is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Novosibirsk is frequently cloudy in the winter due to the collision of Atlantic and Siberian air masses. Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from +15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) to +26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and in winter from \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) to \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F). However, winter temperatures can go as low as \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F) to \u221235 \u00b0C (\u221231 \u00b0F), and summer temperatures can go as high as +30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) to +35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The difference between the highest- and lowest-recorded temperatures is 82 \u00b0C (148 \u00b0F).\nTravellers coming from countries with mild climates may find Novosibirsk's winter tough, but it may not be extraordinary for those from northern countries. At times, bitter cold may hold for some days, but temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and lower do not occur every year.\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\nNovosibirsk is home to Russia's most powerful shortwave relay station east of the Ural mountains. This relay station can reach most of South Asia, the Middle East, and China. The Magadan and Vladivostok relay stations when operated in conjunction with Novosibirsk can guarantee that the Voice of Russia or any other broadcaster renting time at Novosibirsk is heard in the intended target area.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== International and intercity transportation ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nThe city is served by Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport. Tolmachevo is the hub for S7 Airlines. There is also the auxiliary Yeltsovka Airport.

The main railway station of Novosibirsk is Novosibirsk-Glavny station (\"Glavny\" means \"Main\") which is located in the centre of the right bank part of the city. There are also Novosibirsk-Zapadny (\"Zapadny\" means \"Western\"), Novosibirsk-Vostochny (\"Vostochny\" means \"Eastern\"), and Novosibirsk-Yuzhny (\"Yuzhny\" means \"Southern\") railway stations in Novosibirsk. All intercity trains passing through the aforementioned stations stop at these stations. In addition, there are halts where only suburban trains stops, for example Inskaya, Seyatel, Razyezd Inya, and many others.\nThe many regular intercity trains connect Novosibirsk with Russian cities in Siberia, the Far East, Ural, and European Russia. International trains allow to get to China, Mongolia, Belarus, and countries in Central Asia.\n\n\n==== Bus stations ====\nThe old Novosibirsk Bus Station located on Krasny Avenue in the right bank part of the city near Kommunalny Bridge was opened in 1964 and eventually closed on 6 April 2020. There is a plan to build some new bus stations on the periphery of the city; the first of these new bus stations was built on Gusinobrodskoe \u0421haussee and was opened on 18 December 2019. Until the completion of remaining new bus stations, some bus stops in the city are being used by intercity bus services.\nThe many regular intercity/international bus routes connect Novosibirsk with most cities of the southern part of Western Siberia and major cities of Central Asia.\n\n\n==== River passenger terminals ====\nThe building of Novosibirsk river passenger terminal (Russian: \u0420\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043b) on the Ob river was opened in 1974. Later, the self-titled metro station was opened near the building of the terminal. On March 7, 2003, there was the strong fire in the building of the terminal. The part of the building was beyond repair and was demolished.\nAt present day, only one regular passenger line is operational: Novosibirsk - Kudryash island - Yagodnaya - Cheremushki - Novaya Zarya - Bibikha - Sedova Zaimka. There are also cruises on the Ob river and the Novosibirsk Reservoir including to Tomsk and Barnaul.\nUsually, the period of navigability is opened in late April or early May and is closed in late September or early October.\n\n\n=== City public transportation ===\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\n\u0421hronologically, Novosibirsk is the fourth city in Russia (after Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Nizhny Novgorod) and the first city in Siberia in which a metro system was established: the Novosibirsk Metro was opened in 1985.\n\n\n==== Tram system ====\nThe Novosibirsk tram system was launched in 1934.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Trolleybus system ====\n\nThe Novosibirsk trolleybus system was launched in 1957.\n\n\n==== Bus system ====\n\nThe Novosibirsk bus system was launched in 1923.\n\n\n==== Route taxi ====\n\nMarshrutkas (route taxis) have operated in Novosibirsk since the 1990s.\n\n\n==== Waterbus system ====\nThe Novosibirsk waterbus system includes 2 routes: Novosibirsk river passenger terminal - Novosibirsk Waterpark and Novosibirsk river passenger terminal - Beach \"Bugrinskaya Roshcha\" - Korablik island.\nUsually, the period of navigability is opened in late April or early May and is closed in late September or early October.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNovosibirsk is a large industrial center.

        "wiki": "The Monument to the laboratory mouse  is a sculpture in the city of Novosibirsk in Siberia, Russia. It is located in a park in front of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and was completed on July 1, 2013, coinciding with the 120th anniversary of the founding of the city.\nAccording to Nikolai Kolchanov, the director of the institute, the monument commemorates the sacrifice of the mice in genetic research used to understand biological and physiological mechanisms for developing new drugs and curing of diseases.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe monument, which sits on a granite pedestal, is of a laboratory mouse wearing pince-nez on the tip of its nose. The mouse holds knitting needles in its paws and is shown knitting a double helix of DNA. The bronze figure is itself only 70 cm (27\u00bd\u201d) high, but the total height of the monument including the pedestal is 2.5 meters (98\"). The DNA spiral emerging from the knitting needles winds to the left, thus showing that it is the still poorly understood Z-DNA - this symbolic of scientific research that is still to be done. In contrast, the more common B-DNA (depicted in school lessons) winds to the right.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe foundation stone of the monument was laid on June 1, 2012 in honor of the 55th anniversary of the founding of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics. The design for the mouse was the creation of the Novosibirsk artist Andrey Kharkevich, who made more than ten sketches before settling on a final design. It was from among the different versions of the classic and stylized image animals that a mouse knitting the DNA helix was selected.\nAndrei Kharkevich described the statue as: \"Here, the images of a laboratory mouse and a scientist are combined because they are connected to each other and serve one cause. The mouse is shown at the exact time of scientific discovery. If you peer into its eyes, you can see that this mouse has already invented something. But the whole symphony of scientific discovery, joy, \"Eureka!\" has not yet sounded.\"\nSculptor Alexei Agrikolyansky, who made the statue, confessed that it had not been easy to capture that moment as the mouse was obviously not human and yet he had to produce a character and emotions for the mouse that were believable and, while maintaining the anatomical proportions, create something that neither looked like a cartoon character nor a real mouse.\nThe sculpture was cast from bronze in Tomsk by Maxim Petrov.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Monument to lab mouse at Wikimedia Commons",

Located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River, it is the third-most populous city in Russia (after Moscow and St. Petersburg) as well as the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,612,833 as of the 2018 census.Novosibirsk was founded in 1893 on the Ob River crossing point of the future Trans-Siberian Railway. Originally named Novonikolayevsk, it grew rapidly into a major transport, commercial and industrial hub. The city was ravaged by the Russian Civil War but recovered during the early Soviet period, and gained its present name in 1926. Under Stalin, Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of World War II the city hosted many factories relocated from European Russia.\nNovosibirsk is home to the headquarters of numerous Russian corporations, as well as the world-renowned Novosibirsk Zoo. It is served by Tolmachevo Airport, the busiest airport in Siberia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNovosibirsk, founded in 1893 at the future site of a Trans-Siberian Railway bridge crossing the great Siberian river of Ob, was at first named Novonikolayevsk (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a), in honor both of Saint Nicholas and of the reigning Tsar Nicholas II. It superseded nearby Krivoshchekovskaya village, which was founded in 1696. The bridge was completed in the spring of 1897, making the new settlement the regional transport hub. The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway in the early 20th century. The new railway connected Novonikolayevsk to Central Asia and the Caspian Sea.At the time of the bridge's opening, Novonikolayevsk had a population of 7,800 people. The frontier settlement developed rapidly. Its first bank opened in 1906, and a total of five banks were operating by 1915. In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the pre-revolutionary period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000. The city had steady and rapid economic growth, becoming one of the largest commercial and industrial centers of Siberia. It developed a significant agricultural processing industry, as well as a power station, iron foundry, commodity market, several banks, and commercial and shipping companies. By 1917, seven Orthodox churches and one Roman Catholic Church had been built there, along with several cinemas, forty primary schools, a high school, a teaching seminary, and the Romanov House non-classical secondary school. In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.The Russian Civil War took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially that of typhus and cholera, claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city's history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the White Guards, captured Novonikolayevsk. The Red Army took the city in 1919, retaining it throughout the rest of the Civil War.Novonikolayevsk began reconstruction in 1921 at the start of Lenin's New Economic Policy period. It was a part of Tomsk Governorate and served as its administrative center from December 23, 1919 to March 14, 1920. Between June 13, 1921 and May 25, 1925, it served as the administrative center of Novonikolayevsk Governorate, which was separated from Tomsk Governorate. The city was given its present name on September 12, 1926.When governorates were abolished, the city served as the administrative center of Siberian Krai until July 23, 1930, and of West Siberian Krai until September 28, 1937, when that krai was split into Novosibirsk Oblast and Altai Krai. Since then, it has served as the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast.The Monument to the Heroes of the Revolution was erected in the center of the city and has been one of the chief historic sites (essentially every child had to visit the monument on school field trips during the Soviet years). Neglect in the 1990s while other areas were redeveloped helped preserve it in the post-Soviet era.During Joseph Stalin's industrialization effort, Novosibirsk secured its place as one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Several massive industrial facilities were created, including the 'Sibkombain' plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally a metal processing plant, a food processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new power station. The great Soviet famine of 1932\u201333 resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk. They were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city, giving rise to slums.Its rapid growth and industrialization led to Novosibirsk being nicknamed the \"Chicago of Siberia\".Tram rails were laid down in 1934, by which time the population had reached 287,000, making Novosibirsk the largest city in Siberia. The following year the original bridge over the Ob River was replaced by the new Kommunalny bridge.Between 1941 and 1942 more than 50 substantial factories were crated up and relocated from western Russia to Novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through war, and at this time the city became a major supply base for the Red Army. During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.\nThe rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 400 megawatts, necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the Ob Sea. As a direct result of the station's construction, vast areas of fertile land were flooded as were relic pine woods in the area; additionally, the new open space created by the reservoir's surface caused average wind speeds to double, increasing the rate of soil erosion.In the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed that a center for scientific research be built in Novosibirsk, and in 1957 the multi-facility scientific research complex of Akademgorodok was constructed about 30 km (19 mi) south of the city center. The Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (formerly the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them Novosibirsk State University, one of the top Russian schools in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.\nOn September 2, 1962, the population of Novosibirsk reached one million. At that time, it was the youngest city in the world with over a million people. Novosibirsk took fewer than seventy years to achieve this milestone.In 1979, work began on the Novosibirsk Metro Transit System, culminating in the opening of the first line in 1985.On August 1, 2008, Novosibirsk was in the center of the path of a solar eclipse, with a duration of 2 minutes and 20 seconds.\nThe city appeared in the 2019 game Metro Exodus.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nNovosibirsk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Novosibirsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Novosibirsk\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Novosibirsk is incorporated as Novosibirsk Urban Okrug.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nDzerzhinsky (\u0414\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKalininsky (\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKirovsky (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nLeninsky (\u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nOktyabrsky (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nPervomaysky (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nSovetsky (\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nTsentralny (\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439)\nZayeltsovsky (\u0417\u0430\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nZheleznodorozhny (\u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the Federal State Statistics Service, in January 2015 the number of residents came to 1,567,087. This is an increase compared to the 2010 census, when the population of the city was 1,473,754.People from over eighty ethnicities and nationalities reside in Novosibirsk. The largest groups are Russian, Yakut, German, Ukrainian, Tatar, Jewish, and Belarusian.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe best-known trees native to Novosibirsk are birch, pine, and aspen. Some mountain ash, hawthorn, spruce, and fir are also present. European species of apple, ash, elm, linden, and oak have been successfully introduced.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe city stands on the banks of the Ob River in the West Siberian Plain. To the south of the city lies the Priobskoye Plateau. The nearest major cities are Krasnoyarsk, Omsk and Nur-Sultan.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in Novosibirsk is typical of Siberia, with dry winters and far-below-freezing winter temperatures. The reason for these temperatures is the absence of a nearby ocean, the Ural Mountains barring Atlantic air masses from reaching Siberia, and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds. In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being \u00dcr\u00fcmqi in China.\nThe climate is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Novosibirsk is frequently cloudy in the winter due to the collision of Atlantic and Siberian air masses. Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from +15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) to +26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and in winter from \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) to \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F). However, winter temperatures can go as low as \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F) to \u221235 \u00b0C (\u221231 \u00b0F), and summer temperatures can go as high as +30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) to +35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The difference between the highest- and lowest-recorded temperatures is 82 \u00b0C (148 \u00b0F).\nTravellers coming from countries with mild climates may find Novosibirsk's winter tough, but it may not be extraordinary for those from northern countries. At times, bitter cold may hold for some days, but temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and lower do not occur every year.\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\nNovosibirsk is home to Russia's most powerful shortwave relay station east of the Ural mountains. This relay station can reach most of South Asia, the Middle East, and China. The Magadan and Vladivostok relay stations when operated in conjunction with Novosibirsk can guarantee that the Voice of Russia or any other broadcaster renting time at Novosibirsk is heard in the intended target area.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== International and intercity transportation ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nThe city is served by Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport. Tolmachevo is the hub for S7 Airlines. There is also the auxiliary Yeltsovka Airport. A smaller field for general aviation at Novosibirsk Severny Airport was closed in 2012.\nThe many regular flights from Tolmachevo Airport connect Novosibirsk with most Russian largest cities and most countries of Europe and Asia.\n\n\n==== Railway stations ====\n\nNovosibirsk is a major stop on the Trans-Siberian Railway and the north end of Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway. The main railway station of Novosibirsk is Novosibirsk-Glavny station (\"Glavny\" means \"Main\") which is located in the centre of the right bank part of the city. There are also Novosibirsk-Zapadny (\"Zapadny\" means \"Western\"), Novosibirsk-Vostochny (\"Vostochny\" means \"Eastern\"), and Novosibirsk-Yuzhny (\"Yuzhny\" means \"Southern\") railway stations in Novosibirsk. All intercity trains passing through the aforementioned stations stop at these stations. In addition, there are halts where only suburban trains stops, for example Inskaya, Seyatel, Razyezd Inya, and many others.\nThe many regular intercity trains connect Novosibirsk with Russian cities in Siberia, the Far East, Ural, and European Russia.

          "Impressions are the most positive. Although the exposition of Moscow, of course not compare. Nice park, good view of the city. But why bring children under 10-12 years old there? Only discomfort while watching a \u2026",
          "The highest point of the city. Great view of the city. An interesting film about planetary moons and various mirages on Earth. Near the planetarium there is a playground and a ferris wheel with enclosed cabins. \u2026",

Located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River, it is the third-most populous city in Russia (after Moscow and St. Petersburg) as well as the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,612,833 as of the 2018 census.Novosibirsk was founded in 1893 on the Ob River crossing point of the future Trans-Siberian Railway. Originally named Novonikolayevsk, it grew rapidly into a major transport, commercial and industrial hub. The city was ravaged by the Russian Civil War but recovered during the early Soviet period, and gained its present name in 1926. Under Stalin, Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of World War II the city hosted many factories relocated from European Russia.\nNovosibirsk is home to the headquarters of numerous Russian corporations, as well as the world-renowned Novosibirsk Zoo. It is served by Tolmachevo Airport, the busiest airport in Siberia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNovosibirsk, founded in 1893 at the future site of a Trans-Siberian Railway bridge crossing the great Siberian river of Ob, was at first named Novonikolayevsk (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a), in honor both of Saint Nicholas and of the reigning Tsar Nicholas II. It superseded nearby Krivoshchekovskaya village, which was founded in 1696. The bridge was completed in the spring of 1897, making the new settlement the regional transport hub. The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway in the early 20th century. The new railway connected Novonikolayevsk to Central Asia and the Caspian Sea.At the time of the bridge's opening, Novonikolayevsk had a population of 7,800 people. The frontier settlement developed rapidly. Its first bank opened in 1906, and a total of five banks were operating by 1915. In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the pre-revolutionary period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000. The city had steady and rapid economic growth, becoming one of the largest commercial and industrial centers of Siberia. It developed a significant agricultural processing industry, as well as a power station, iron foundry, commodity market, several banks, and commercial and shipping companies. By 1917, seven Orthodox churches and one Roman Catholic Church had been built there, along with several cinemas, forty primary schools, a high school, a teaching seminary, and the Romanov House non-classical secondary school. In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.The Russian Civil War took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially that of typhus and cholera, claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city's history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the White Guards, captured Novonikolayevsk. The Red Army took the city in 1919, retaining it throughout the rest of the Civil War.Novonikolayevsk began reconstruction in 1921 at the start of Lenin's New Economic Policy period. It was a part of Tomsk Governorate and served as its administrative center from December 23, 1919 to March 14, 1920. Between June 13, 1921 and May 25, 1925, it served as the administrative center of Novonikolayevsk Governorate, which was separated from Tomsk Governorate. The city was given its present name on September 12, 1926.When governorates were abolished, the city served as the administrative center of Siberian Krai until July 23, 1930, and of West Siberian Krai until September 28, 1937, when that krai was split into Novosibirsk Oblast and Altai Krai. Since then, it has served as the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast.The Monument to the Heroes of the Revolution was erected in the center of the city and has been one of the chief historic sites (essentially every child had to visit the monument on school field trips during the Soviet years). Neglect in the 1990s while other areas were redeveloped helped preserve it in the post-Soviet era.During Joseph Stalin's industrialization effort, Novosibirsk secured its place as one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Several massive industrial facilities were created, including the 'Sibkombain' plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally a metal processing plant, a food processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new power station. The great Soviet famine of 1932\u201333 resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk. They were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city, giving rise to slums.Its rapid growth and industrialization led to Novosibirsk being nicknamed the \"Chicago of Siberia\".Tram rails were laid down in 1934, by which time the population had reached 287,000, making Novosibirsk the largest city in Siberia. The following year the original bridge over the Ob River was replaced by the new Kommunalny bridge.Between 1941 and 1942 more than 50 substantial factories were crated up and relocated from western Russia to Novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through war, and at this time the city became a major supply base for the Red Army. During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.\nThe rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 400 megawatts, necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the Ob Sea. As a direct result of the station's construction, vast areas of fertile land were flooded as were relic pine woods in the area; additionally, the new open space created by the reservoir's surface caused average wind speeds to double, increasing the rate of soil erosion.In the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed that a center for scientific research be built in Novosibirsk, and in 1957 the multi-facility scientific research complex of Akademgorodok was constructed about 30 km (19 mi) south of the city center. The Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (formerly the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them Novosibirsk State University, one of the top Russian schools in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.\nOn September 2, 1962, the population of Novosibirsk reached one million. At that time, it was the youngest city in the world with over a million people. Novosibirsk took fewer than seventy years to achieve this milestone.In 1979, work began on the Novosibirsk Metro Transit System, culminating in the opening of the first line in 1985.On August 1, 2008, Novosibirsk was in the center of the path of a solar eclipse, with a duration of 2 minutes and 20 seconds.\nThe city appeared in the 2019 game Metro Exodus.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nNovosibirsk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Novosibirsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Novosibirsk\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Novosibirsk is incorporated as Novosibirsk Urban Okrug.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nDzerzhinsky (\u0414\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKalininsky (\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKirovsky (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nLeninsky (\u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nOktyabrsky (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nPervomaysky (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nSovetsky (\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nTsentralny (\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439)\nZayeltsovsky (\u0417\u0430\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nZheleznodorozhny (\u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the Federal State Statistics Service, in January 2015 the number of residents came to 1,567,087. This is an increase compared to the 2010 census, when the population of the city was 1,473,754.People from over eighty ethnicities and nationalities reside in Novosibirsk. The largest groups are Russian, Yakut, German, Ukrainian, Tatar, Jewish, and Belarusian.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe best-known trees native to Novosibirsk are birch, pine, and aspen. Some mountain ash, hawthorn, spruce, and fir are also present. European species of apple, ash, elm, linden, and oak have been successfully introduced.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe city stands on the banks of the Ob River in the West Siberian Plain. To the south of the city lies the Priobskoye Plateau. The nearest major cities are Krasnoyarsk, Omsk and Nur-Sultan.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in Novosibirsk is typical of Siberia, with dry winters and far-below-freezing winter temperatures. The reason for these temperatures is the absence of a nearby ocean, the Ural Mountains barring Atlantic air masses from reaching Siberia, and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds. In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being \u00dcr\u00fcmqi in China.\nThe climate is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Novosibirsk is frequently cloudy in the winter due to the collision of Atlantic and Siberian air masses. Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from +15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) to +26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and in winter from \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) to \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F). However, winter temperatures can go as low as \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F) to \u221235 \u00b0C (\u221231 \u00b0F), and summer temperatures can go as high as +30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) to +35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The difference between the highest- and lowest-recorded temperatures is 82 \u00b0C (148 \u00b0F).\nTravellers coming from countries with mild climates may find Novosibirsk's winter tough, but it may not be extraordinary for those from northern countries. At times, bitter cold may hold for some days, but temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and lower do not occur every year.\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\nNovosibirsk is home to Russia's most powerful shortwave relay station east of the Ural mountains. This relay station can reach most of South Asia, the Middle East, and China. The Magadan and Vladivostok relay stations when operated in conjunction with Novosibirsk can guarantee that the Voice of Russia or any other broadcaster renting time at Novosibirsk is heard in the intended target area.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== International and intercity transportation ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nThe city is served by Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport.

All intercity trains passing through the aforementioned stations stop at these stations. In addition, there are halts where only suburban trains stops, for example Inskaya, Seyatel, Razyezd Inya, and many others.\nThe many regular intercity trains connect Novosibirsk with Russian cities in Siberia, the Far East, Ural, and European Russia. International trains allow to get to China, Mongolia, Belarus, and countries in Central Asia.\n\n\n==== Bus stations ====\nThe old Novosibirsk Bus Station located on Krasny Avenue in the right bank part of the city near Kommunalny Bridge was opened in 1964 and eventually closed on 6 April 2020. There is a plan to build some new bus stations on the periphery of the city; the first of these new bus stations was built on Gusinobrodskoe \u0421haussee and was opened on 18 December 2019.

Later, the self-titled metro station was opened near the building of the terminal. On March 7, 2003, there was the strong fire in the building of the terminal. The part of the building was beyond repair and was demolished.\nAt present day, only one regular passenger line is operational: Novosibirsk - Kudryash island - Yagodnaya - Cheremushki - Novaya Zarya - Bibikha - Sedova Zaimka.

        "wiki": "The Trinity (Russian: \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0446\u0430, tr. Troitsa, also called The Hospitality of Abraham) is an icon created by Russian painter Andrei Rublev in the 15th century. It is his most famous work and the most famous of all Russian icons, and it is regarded as one of the highest achievements of Russian art. Scholars believe that it is one of only two works of art (the other being the Dormition Cathedral frescoes in Vladimir) that can be attributed to Rublev with any sort of certainty.The Trinity depicts the three angels who visited Abraham at the Oak of Mamre (Genesis 18:1\u20138), but the painting is full of symbolism and is interpreted as an icon of the Holy Trinity. At the time of Rublev, the Holy Trinity was the embodiment of spiritual unity, peace, harmony, mutual love and humility.The icon was commissioned to honour Saint Sergius of Radonezh of the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, near Moscow, now in the town of Sergiyev Posad. Little is known about The Trinity's history, and art historians make suggestions based on only the few known facts. Even the authorship of Rublev has been questioned. Various authors suggest different dates, such as 1408\u20131425, 1422\u20131423 or 1420\u20131427. The official version states 1411 or 1425\u201327. The Trinity is currently held in the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Trinity was painted on a vertically aligned board. It depicts three angels sitting at a table. On the table, there is a cup containing the head of a calf. In the background, Rublev painted a house (supposedly Abraham's house), a tree (the Oak of Mamre), and a mountain (Mount Moriah). The figures of angels are arranged so that the lines of their bodies form a full circle. The middle angel and the one on the left bless the cup with a hand gesture. There is no action or movement in the painting. The figures gaze into eternity in the state of motionless contemplation. There are sealed traces of nails from the icon's riza (metal protective cover) on the margins, halos and around the cup.\n\n\n=== Iconography ===\n\nThe icon is based on a story from the Book of Genesis called Abraham and Sarah's Hospitality or The Hospitality of Abraham (\u00a718). It says that the biblical Patriarch Abraham 'was sitting at the door of his tent in the heat of the day' by the Oak of Mamre and saw three men standing in front of him, who in the next chapter were revealed as angels. 'When he saw them, Abraham ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth.'  Abraham ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf, and set curds, milk and the calf before them, waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate (Genesis 18:1\u20138). One of the angels told Abraham that Sarah would soon give birth to a son. \n\nThe subject of The Trinity received various interpretations at different time periods, but by the 19th\u201320th century the consensus among scholars was the following: the three angels who visited Abraham represented the Christian Trinity, \"one God in three persons\" \u2013 the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. Art critics believe that Andrei Rublev's icon was created in accordance with this concept. In his effort to uncover the doctrine of the Trinity, Rublev abandoned most of the traditional plot elements which were typically included in the paintings of the Abraham and Sarah's Hospitality story. He did not paint Abraham, Sarah, the scene of calf's slaughter, nor did he give any details on the meal. The angels were depicted as talking, not eating. \"The gestures of angels, smooth and restrained, demonstrate the sublime nature of their conversation\". The silent communion of the three angels is the centre of the composition.\n\nIn Rublev's icon, the form that most clearly represents the idea of the consubstantiality of the Trinity's three hypostases is a circle. It is the foundation of the composition. At the same time, the angels are not inserted into the circle, but create it instead, thus our eyes can't stop at any of the three figures and rather dwell inside this limited space. The impactful center of the composition is the cup with the calf's head. It hints at the crucifixion sacrifice and serves as the reminder of the Eucharist (the left and the right angels' figures make a silhouette that resembles a cup). Around the cup, which is placed on the table, the silent dialogue of gestures takes place.\n\nThe left angel symbolizes God the Father. He blesses the cup, yet his hand is painted in a distance, as if he passes the cup to the central angel. Viktor Lazarev suggests that the central angel represents Jesus Christ, who in turn blesses the cup as well and accepts it with a bow as if saying \"My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will\". (Mt 26:39) The nature of each of the three hypostases is revealed through their symbolic attributes, i.e. the house, the tree, and the mountain. The starting point of the divine administration is the creative Will of God, therefore Rublev places the Abraham's house above the corresponding angel's head. The Oak of Mamre can be interpreted as the tree of life, and it serves as a reminder of the Jesus's death on the cross and his subsequent resurrection, which opened the way to eternal life. The Oak is located in the centre, above the angel who symbolizes Jesus. Finally, the mountain is a symbol of the spiritual ascent, which mankind accomplishes with the help of the Holy Spirit. The unity of the Trinity's three hypostases expresses unity and love between all things: \"That they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.\" (John 17:21)\nThe wings of two angels, the Father and the Son, interlap. The blue colour of the Son's robe symbolizes divinity, the brown colour represents earth, his humanity, and the gold speaks of kingship of God. The wings of the Holy Spirit do not touch the Son's wings, they are imperceptibly divided by the Son's spear. The blue colour of the Holy Spirit's robe symbolizes divinity, the green colour represents new life. The poses and the  inclinations of the Holy Spirit and the Son's heads demonstrate their submission to the Father, yet their placement on the thrones at the same level symbolizes equality.\n\n\n=== The rizas ===\n\nAccording to Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius records as of 1575, the icon was \"covered with gold\" at the order of Ivan the Terrible, i.e. a golden riza was commissioned by him and added to the icon. The golden riza was renewed in 1600 during the tsardom of Boris Godunov. A new riza copied that of Ivan the Terrible, while the original was moved to the new copy of The Trinity painted specifically for that purpose. In 1626 Michael I ordered golden tsatas with enamel and gemstones to be added to the riza. In the 18th century the gilded silver stamped angel attires were added. Another copy of the riza was made in 1926\u201328. Both copies are now kept in the Trinity Lavra's Trinity Cathedral iconostasis.\n\n\n== Dating and provenance ==\nThe dating of The Trinity is uncertain. There is not much historical data on the subject, and even at the beginning of the 20th century historians did not dare to claim any facts and could only make guesses and assumptions. The icon was first mentioned in 1551 in The Book of One Hundred Chapters, the collection of Church laws and regulations made by the Stoglavy Synod. Among other things, The Book stated the Synod's decisions that had been made about the iconography of the Holy Trinity, in particular the details that were considered canonically necessary for such icons, such as crosses and halos.\n\n... the icon painter [has] to paint icons from the ancient examples, as did the Greek icon painters, and as did Ondrei [sic] Rublev and other predecessors...(Russian: \u041f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0446\u0435\u043c \u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0441 \u0434\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432, \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0433\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0446\u044b \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0438, \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b \u041e\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0420\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0432 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0446\u044b...)\n\nIt is evident from this text that participants of the Stoglavy Synod were aware of some Trinity icon which had been created by Andrei Rublev and which, in their opinion, corresponded with every church canon and could be taken as a model example.The next known source that mentions The Trinity is The Legend of the Saint Icon Painters (Russian: \u0421\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0445 \u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0446\u0430\u0445) compiled at the end of 17th century\u2014the beginning of the 18th century. It contains a lot of semi-legendary stories, including a mention that Nikon of Radonezh, the pupil of Sergius of Radonezh, asked Andrei Rublev \"to paint the image of the Holy Trinity to honour the father Sergius\". Unfortunately this late source is viewed by most historians as unreliable. However, due to lack of other facts, this version of The Trinity's making is generally accepted. The question of when the conversation with Nikon occurred remains open.\nThe original wooden Trinity Church, located on the territory of the Trinity Lavra, burned down in 1411, and Nikon of Radonezh decided to build a new church. By 1425 the stone Trinity Cathedral was erected, which still stands today. It is believed that Nikon, who became the prior after the death of Sergius of Radonezh, sensed his forthcoming death, and invited Andrei Rublev and Daniel Chorny to finish the decoration of the recently built cathedral. The icon painters were supposed to make the frescos and create the many-tiered iconostasis. But neither Life of St. Sergius, the hagiographical account of his life, nor Life of St. Nikon mention The Trinity icon, it is only written the decoration of the Cathedral in 1425\u20131427.\n\nThis dating is based on the dates of the construction of both churches. Nevertheless, art critics, taking into account the style of the icon, do not consider the matter resolved. Igor Grabar dated The Trinity 1408\u20131425, Yulia Lebedeva suggested 1422\u20131423, Valentina Antonova suggested 1420\u20131427. It is unknown if The Trinity was created during Rublev's peak of creativity in 1408\u20141420 or late in his life. Style analysis shows that it could have been created around 1408, because it is stylistically similar to his frescoes in the Dormition Cathedral (created roughly at the same time). On the other hand, The Trinity demonstrates firmness and perfection which was unmatched even by the best of Trinity Cathedral's icons painted between 1425 and 1427.The Soviet historian Vladimir Plugin had a theory that the icon had nothing to do with Nikon of Radonezh, but was brought to the Trinity Lavra by Ivan the Terrible. He theorized that all previous scholars after the famous historian Alexander Gorsky made the wrong assumption that Ivan the Terrible only \"covered with gold\" the icon that had already been kept at the Trinity Lavra. Plugin said that the icon was brought to the Lavra by Ivan himself, and that The Trinity had been created much earlier, probably 150 years prior to that date. However, in 1998 Boris Kloss pointed out that the so-called Troitsk Story of the Siege of Kazan, written before June 1553, contains a clear reference to the fact that Ivan the Terrible only \"decorated\" the existing icon for the Lavra.\n\n\n== Authorship ==\nRublev was first called the author of a Trinity icon in the middle of the 16th-century text The Book of One Hundred Chapters. Scholars can be quite certain that by the mid-16th century, Rublev was considered to be the author of an icon with such name. The Russian ethnographer Ivan Snegiryov made a suggestion that The Trinity kept in the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius was in fact the icon of Rublev, who then was one of the few Russian icon painters known by name. The idea gained popularity among scholars and by 1905, it was predominate. The Trinity is still generally accepted as his work.\nNevertheless, after cleaning of the icon art critics were so amazed by its beauty that some theories arose about it being created by an Italian painter. The first person to make the suggestion was Dmitry Rovinsky even before the cleaning, but his idea \"was immediately extinguished by the note from metropolitan Philaret; and again, on the basis of the legend, the icon was attributed to Rublev. It continued to serve to those who studied this painter's style as one of his main works of art\". Dmitry Aynalov, Nikolai Sychyov and then Nikolay Punin all compared The Trinity to the works of Giotto and Duccio. Viktor Lazarev compared it to the works of Piero della Francesca. However, they most likely intended to point out the high quality of the painting because none of them claimed that it was created under the influence of the Italians. Viktor Lazarev sums it up: \"In the light of recent analysis we can definitely state that Rublev was not familiar with the works of Italian art and therefore could not borrow anything from that. His main source was the Byzantine art of the Palaiologos era, in particular the paintings created in its capital, Constantinople. The elegance of his angels, the inclined heads motive, the rectangular shape of the meal were derived exactly from there\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius archives, the icon was kept in the Trinity Cathedral since 1575. It took the main place (to the right of the royal doors) in the bottom tier of the iconostasis. It was one of the most revered icons in the monastery, attracting generous donations from the reigning monarchs (first Ivan the Terrible, then Boris Godunov and his family), but the main object of veneration in the monastery was Sergius of Radonezh's relics. Until the end of 1904, The Trinity was hidden from the eyes under the heavy golden riza, which left only the faces and the hands of the angels (the so-called \"face image\") open.\nAt the turn of the 19th and 20th century, Russian iconography was \"discovered\" by art historians as a form of art. Icons were taken out of the rizas that used to cover them almost completely except for faces and hands and then cleaned. The clearing was necessary because the icons were traditionally coated with a layer of drying oil. Under normal conditions, the drying oil fully darkened in 30\u201390 years. A new icon could be painted over the darkened layer. Usually, it had the same theme but the style was changed accordingly to the new aesthetic principles of that time. In some cases, the new painter kept the proportions and the composition of the original, but in other cases, the painter copied the theme but made adjustments to the proportions of the figures and the poses and changed other details. It was called the \"icon renewal\" (Russian: \u043f\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d). The Trinity was under \"renewal\" four or five times. The first renewal probably happened during the tsardom of Boris Godunov. The next was most likely finished by 1635, with the renewal of all monumental paintings and the iconostasis of the Trinity Lavra. Art historians attribute most of the damage of the layer of paint to that period. The damage done by pumice is especially visible on the angels' clothing and the background. The Trinity was further renewed in 1777 at the times of the Metropolitan Platon, when the whole iconostasis was remade. Vasily Guryanov stated that it was renewed two more times in 1835 and 1854: by the Palekh school painters and by the artist I. M. Malyshev, respectively.\n\n\n=== The 1904 cleaning ===\nAt the beginning of the 20th century many icons were cleaned one by one, and many of them turned out to be masterpieces. Eventually scholars became interested in The Trinity from the Trinity Lavra. Compared to other icons such as Theotokos of Vladimir or Our Lady of Kazan The Trinity was not particularly revered, because there was nothing special about it, it was not \"miracle-working\" or myrrh-streaming, and it didn't become a source for a large number of copies. However it had a certain reputation due to the fact that it was believed to be the very icon from The Book of One Hundred Chapters. As Andrei Rublev's name appeared in The Book as well, he was held in high regard among the Christian believers. A lot of different icons and frescoes were attributed to him, e.g. the frescoes in the Church of the Dormition in Gorodok. The cleaning of The Trinity could theoretically reveal a perfect example of his style and help with the examination of the other icons that were attributed to him on the basis of legends or common belief.Invited by the prior of the Trinity Lavra in the spring of 1904, Vasily Guryanov took the icon out from the iconostasis, removed the riza and then cleaned it from the \"renewals\" and the drying oil. Ilya Ostroukhov recommended him for the job. He was helped by V. A. Tyulin and A. I. Izraztsov. After removing the riza, Guryanov did not find out Rublev's painting, but discovered the results of all the \"renewals\". Rublev's art was underneath them. He wrote: \"When the golden riza was removed from this icon, we saw a perfectly painted icon. The background and the margins were coloured brown, golden inscription were new. All angels' clothes were repainted in a lilac tone and whitewashed not with paint, but with gold; the table, the mountain and the house were repainted\u2026 There were only faces left on which it was possible to evaluate that this icon was ancient, but even they were shaded by brown oil paint.\". As it became clear during another restoration in 1919, Guryanov didn't reach the original layer in some places. After Guryanov removed three upper layers, the last of which was painted in the Palekh school style, he revealed the original layer. Both the restorer and the eyewitnesses of the occasion were stunned. Instead of dark smoky tones of drying oil and brown-toned clothing that was typical for iconography of that time, they saw bright colours and transparent clothing that reminded them of the 14th century Italian frescos and icons. Then he repainted the icon according to his own views on how it should look like. After that The Trinity was returned to the iconostasis.\nGuryanov's effort was panned even by his contemporaries. In 1915 Nikolai Sychyov pointed out that his restoration actually hid the work of art from us. It had to be liquidated later. Y. Malkov summed up:\n\nOnly the painting's exposure in 1918 can be called \"a restoration\" in the modern scientific meaning of this word (and even that cannot be said without some reservations); all previous works on The Trinity were, in fact, only \"renewals\", including the \"restoration\" that took place in 1904\u20141905 under the guidance of V. P. Guryanov... No doubt, the restorers consciously tried to strengthen all the graphic and linear structure of the icon, with rough augmentation of the figures' contours, clothes, halos. There was even an obvious meddling in the inner sanctum, the \"face image\" area, where insufficiently cleaned remains of the author's.. lines...(which were already rather schematically reproduced by the latest renewals of the 16\u201419th centuries) were literally rumpled and absorbed by the rigid graphics of V. P. Guryanov and his assistants.\n\n\n=== The 1918 cleaning ===\n\nAs soon as the icon returned to the Trinity Cathedral's iconostasis, it darkened again very quickly. It was necessary to open it again. The Ancient Paintings Cleaning Committee of Russia took charge of the restoration in 1918. Yury Olsufyev was the leader of the team which also included Igor Grabar, Alexander Anisimov, Alexis Gritchenko, and the Works of Art Protection Committee under the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, which included Yury Olsufyev himself, Pavel Florensky, Pavel Kapterev. Restoration work commenced on 28 November 28, 1918 and lasted until 2 January 2, 1919. It was carried out by I. Suslov, V. Tyulin, and G. Chirikov. All stages of the cleaning were recorded in detail in the Diary. Based on this records and Yury Olsufyev's personal observations, the summary of the works called Protocol No. 1 was created in 1925. These documents are kept in the Tretyakov Gallery archives. Some details and lines were restored, others were found damaged beyond restoration.Problems with the safe-keeping of The Trinity stated in 1918\u201319 immediately after its cleaning. Twice a year, in spring and in autumn, humidity in the Trinity Cathedral increased and the icon was transferred to the so-called First Icon Depository. The continued changes in temperature and humidity affected its condition.\n\n\n=== In the Tretyakov Gallery ===\nBefore the October Revolution The Trinity remained in the Trinity Cathedral, but after the Soviet government sent it to the recently founded Central National Restoration Workshop. On 20 April 1920 the Council of People's Commissars issued a decree called About the Conversion of the Historical and Artistic Valuables of the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius into a Museum (Russian: \u041e\u0431 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0446\u0435-\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u044b). It handed the Lavra itself and all its collections over to the jurisdiction of the National Education Commissariat \"for the purpose of democratization of artistic and historical buildings by transformation of said buildings and collections into museums\". The Trinity ended up in the Zagorsk National Park & Museum of History and Arts. In 1929 the icon arrived to the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, while the copy made by Nikolai Baranov replaced the original in the iconostasis.\n\nThe icon is kept in Andrei Rublev's room of the Tretyakov Gallery. It has left the Gallery only twice. First it happened in 1941 during World War II evacuation. It was temporarily moved to the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theatre in Novosibirsk. On 17 May 1945 The Trinity was returned to the Tretyakov Gallery. In May 2007 The Trinity was is taken out for the Europe-Russia-Europe exhibition, but a piece of the board was dislocated and had to be fixed and reinforced. Since 1997 the icon is moved every Pentecost from Andrei Rublev's room to the Tretyakov Gallery's church. It is placed under a special show-window with perfect temperature and humidity conditions. The first President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin had an idea of handing the icon over back to the Church. However Valentin Yanin with an assistance of Yuri Melentyev, the Minister of Culture at that time, managed to meet with the President and made him change his mind. The matter concluded with a decree published in the Rossiyskaya Gazeta, The Trinity was declared a property of the Tretyakov Gallery forever.\nIn 2008 Levon Nersesyan, one of the Gallery staff members, revealed that Patriarch Alexy had requested the icon to be brought to the Lavra for the religious holiday in the summer of 2009. Most scholars agreed that the climate inside the Cathedral is completely unsuitable for the icon keeping, that candles, frankincense and the transportation could destroy it. The only person who supported the move was the director of the Gallery. All the other staff, art critics and art historians were against it. The director was accused of committing a misfeasance. Valentin Yanin said: \"The Trinity is an outstanding work of art, a national patrimony, which should be available to people of all beliefs regardless of their religion. Outstanding works of art are supposed to be kept not inside churches for a narrow circle of parishioners to see, but in public museums.\" The icon eventually stayed in the museum.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\n\nThe present condition of The Trinity differs from its original condition. Changes were made to it at least as early as 1600, and most probably even earlier. The condition closest to the original one that the restorers managed to achieve was after the restoration of 1918. That restoration revealed most of Rublev's original work, but numerous traces of the work of Guryanov and of other centuries were preserved. The present surface is a combination of layers created during various time periods. The icon is presently strengthened by shponkas, i. e. small dowels that are used specifically for icons.\nPresently The Trinity is kept in a special glass cabinet in the museum under constant humidity and temperature conditions.\nThe Tretyakov Gallery reported the present condition as \"stable\". There are persistent gaps between the ground and paint layers, especially in the margins. The primary problem is a vertical crack passing through the surface in the front, which a rupture between the first and second ground boards at an unknown time caused. Guryanov recorded the crack during his cleaning: a 1905 photograph depicts the crack as already present.\nThe crack became noticeable in 1931 and was partially fixed in the spring of 1931. At that time, the gap reached 2 mm at the top part of the icon and 1 mm on the face of the right angel. Yury Olsufyev attempted repair by moving the icon to a special room with artificially induced high humidity of circa 70%. The gap between the boards closed almost completely in 1\u20135 months. By the summer of 1931 the progress of narrowing the gap via exposure to the humidity ceased. It was then decided to strengthen the layer of gesso and the layer of paint with mastic, and fill the gap with it.The restorers could not be certain how different layers of paint of different times might have reacted to the slightest ambient changes. The slightest climatic change may still cause unpredictable damage. The committee of restorers of the Tretyakov Gallery deliberated at length on various suggestions of how to further strengthen the icon, and on 10 November 2008 the committee concluded that the present, stable condition of the icon is not to be interfered with in any circumstance.\n\n\n== Copies ==\nThere are two consecrated copies of The Trinity. By the Orthodox church tradition, the consecrated copy of an icon and the original (also called the protograph) are completely interchangeable.\nThe Godunov's copy, commissioned by Boris Godunov in 1598\u20131600 for the purpose of moving the Ivan the Terrible riza to it. It was kept in the Trinity Cathedral of the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius.\nThe Baranov and Chirikov's copy, commissioned in 1926\u201328 for the International Icon Restoration Exhibition in 1929. It replaced the original icon after it had been moved to the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.Both icons are now kept in the iconostasis of the Trinity Cathedral in Sergiyev Posad.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSaint Thomas Aquinas. \"Thankagiving prayer after Mass\".

Located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River, it is the third-most populous city in Russia (after Moscow and St. Petersburg) as well as the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,612,833 as of the 2018 census.Novosibirsk was founded in 1893 on the Ob River crossing point of the future Trans-Siberian Railway. Originally named Novonikolayevsk, it grew rapidly into a major transport, commercial and industrial hub. The city was ravaged by the Russian Civil War but recovered during the early Soviet period, and gained its present name in 1926. Under Stalin, Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of World War II the city hosted many factories relocated from European Russia.\nNovosibirsk is home to the headquarters of numerous Russian corporations, as well as the world-renowned Novosibirsk Zoo. It is served by Tolmachevo Airport, the busiest airport in Siberia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNovosibirsk, founded in 1893 at the future site of a Trans-Siberian Railway bridge crossing the great Siberian river of Ob, was at first named Novonikolayevsk (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a), in honor both of Saint Nicholas and of the reigning Tsar Nicholas II. It superseded nearby Krivoshchekovskaya village, which was founded in 1696. The bridge was completed in the spring of 1897, making the new settlement the regional transport hub. The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway in the early 20th century. The new railway connected Novonikolayevsk to Central Asia and the Caspian Sea.At the time of the bridge's opening, Novonikolayevsk had a population of 7,800 people. The frontier settlement developed rapidly. Its first bank opened in 1906, and a total of five banks were operating by 1915. In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the pre-revolutionary period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000. The city had steady and rapid economic growth, becoming one of the largest commercial and industrial centers of Siberia. It developed a significant agricultural processing industry, as well as a power station, iron foundry, commodity market, several banks, and commercial and shipping companies. By 1917, seven Orthodox churches and one Roman Catholic Church had been built there, along with several cinemas, forty primary schools, a high school, a teaching seminary, and the Romanov House non-classical secondary school. In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.The Russian Civil War took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially that of typhus and cholera, claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city's history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the White Guards, captured Novonikolayevsk. The Red Army took the city in 1919, retaining it throughout the rest of the Civil War.Novonikolayevsk began reconstruction in 1921 at the start of Lenin's New Economic Policy period. It was a part of Tomsk Governorate and served as its administrative center from December 23, 1919 to March 14, 1920. Between June 13, 1921 and May 25, 1925, it served as the administrative center of Novonikolayevsk Governorate, which was separated from Tomsk Governorate. The city was given its present name on September 12, 1926.When governorates were abolished, the city served as the administrative center of Siberian Krai until July 23, 1930, and of West Siberian Krai until September 28, 1937, when that krai was split into Novosibirsk Oblast and Altai Krai. Since then, it has served as the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast.The Monument to the Heroes of the Revolution was erected in the center of the city and has been one of the chief historic sites (essentially every child had to visit the monument on school field trips during the Soviet years). Neglect in the 1990s while other areas were redeveloped helped preserve it in the post-Soviet era.During Joseph Stalin's industrialization effort, Novosibirsk secured its place as one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Several massive industrial facilities were created, including the 'Sibkombain' plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally a metal processing plant, a food processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new power station. The great Soviet famine of 1932\u201333 resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk. They were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city, giving rise to slums.Its rapid growth and industrialization led to Novosibirsk being nicknamed the \"Chicago of Siberia\".Tram rails were laid down in 1934, by which time the population had reached 287,000, making Novosibirsk the largest city in Siberia. The following year the original bridge over the Ob River was replaced by the new Kommunalny bridge.Between 1941 and 1942 more than 50 substantial factories were crated up and relocated from western Russia to Novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through war, and at this time the city became a major supply base for the Red Army. During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.\nThe rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 400 megawatts, necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the Ob Sea. As a direct result of the station's construction, vast areas of fertile land were flooded as were relic pine woods in the area; additionally, the new open space created by the reservoir's surface caused average wind speeds to double, increasing the rate of soil erosion.In the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed that a center for scientific research be built in Novosibirsk, and in 1957 the multi-facility scientific research complex of Akademgorodok was constructed about 30 km (19 mi) south of the city center. The Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (formerly the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them Novosibirsk State University, one of the top Russian schools in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.\nOn September 2, 1962, the population of Novosibirsk reached one million. At that time, it was the youngest city in the world with over a million people. Novosibirsk took fewer than seventy years to achieve this milestone.In 1979, work began on the Novosibirsk Metro Transit System, culminating in the opening of the first line in 1985.On August 1, 2008, Novosibirsk was in the center of the path of a solar eclipse, with a duration of 2 minutes and 20 seconds.\nThe city appeared in the 2019 game Metro Exodus.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nNovosibirsk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Novosibirsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Novosibirsk\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Novosibirsk is incorporated as Novosibirsk Urban Okrug.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nDzerzhinsky (\u0414\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKalininsky (\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKirovsky (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nLeninsky (\u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nOktyabrsky (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nPervomaysky (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nSovetsky (\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nTsentralny (\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439)\nZayeltsovsky (\u0417\u0430\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nZheleznodorozhny (\u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the Federal State Statistics Service, in January 2015 the number of residents came to 1,567,087. This is an increase compared to the 2010 census, when the population of the city was 1,473,754.People from over eighty ethnicities and nationalities reside in Novosibirsk. The largest groups are Russian, Yakut, German, Ukrainian, Tatar, Jewish, and Belarusian.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe best-known trees native to Novosibirsk are birch, pine, and aspen. Some mountain ash, hawthorn, spruce, and fir are also present. European species of apple, ash, elm, linden, and oak have been successfully introduced.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe city stands on the banks of the Ob River in the West Siberian Plain. To the south of the city lies the Priobskoye Plateau. The nearest major cities are Krasnoyarsk, Omsk and Nur-Sultan.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in Novosibirsk is typical of Siberia, with dry winters and far-below-freezing winter temperatures. The reason for these temperatures is the absence of a nearby ocean, the Ural Mountains barring Atlantic air masses from reaching Siberia, and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds. In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being \u00dcr\u00fcmqi in China.\nThe climate is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Novosibirsk is frequently cloudy in the winter due to the collision of Atlantic and Siberian air masses. Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from +15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) to +26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and in winter from \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) to \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F). However, winter temperatures can go as low as \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F) to \u221235 \u00b0C (\u221231 \u00b0F), and summer temperatures can go as high as +30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) to +35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The difference between the highest- and lowest-recorded temperatures is 82 \u00b0C (148 \u00b0F).\nTravellers coming from countries with mild climates may find Novosibirsk's winter tough, but it may not be extraordinary for those from northern countries. At times, bitter cold may hold for some days, but temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and lower do not occur every year.\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\nNovosibirsk is home to Russia's most powerful shortwave relay station east of the Ural mountains. This relay station can reach most of South Asia, the Middle East, and China. The Magadan and Vladivostok relay stations when operated in conjunction with Novosibirsk can guarantee that the Voice of Russia or any other broadcaster renting time at Novosibirsk is heard in the intended target area.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== International and intercity transportation ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nThe city is served by Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport. Tolmachevo is the hub for S7 Airlines. There is also the auxiliary Yeltsovka Airport. A smaller field for general aviation at Novosibirsk Severny Airport was closed in 2012.\nThe many regular flights from Tolmachevo Airport connect Novosibirsk with most Russian largest cities and most countries of Europe and Asia.\n\n\n==== Railway stations ====\n\nNovosibirsk is a major stop on the Trans-Siberian Railway and the north end of Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway. The main railway station of Novosibirsk is Novosibirsk-Glavny station (\"Glavny\" means \"Main\") which is located in the centre of the right bank part of the city. There are also Novosibirsk-Zapadny (\"Zapadny\" means \"Western\"), Novosibirsk-Vostochny (\"Vostochny\" means \"Eastern\"), and Novosibirsk-Yuzhny (\"Yuzhny\" means \"Southern\") railway stations in Novosibirsk. All intercity trains passing through the aforementioned stations stop at these stations. In addition, there are halts where only suburban trains stops, for example Inskaya, Seyatel, Razyezd Inya, and many others.\nThe many regular intercity trains connect Novosibirsk with Russian cities in Siberia, the Far East, Ural, and European Russia. International trains allow to get to China, Mongolia, Belarus, and countries in Central Asia.\n\n\n==== Bus stations ====\nThe old Novosibirsk Bus Station located on Krasny Avenue in the right bank part of the city near Kommunalny Bridge was opened in 1964 and eventually closed on 6 April 2020. There is a plan to build some new bus stations on the periphery of the city; the first of these new bus stations was built on Gusinobrodskoe \u0421haussee and was opened on 18 December 2019. Until the completion of remaining new bus stations, some bus stops in the city are being used by intercity bus services.\nThe many regular intercity/international bus routes connect Novosibirsk with most cities of the southern part of Western Siberia and major cities of Central Asia.\n\n\n==== River passenger terminals ====\nThe building of Novosibirsk river passenger terminal (Russian: \u0420\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043b) on the Ob river was opened in 1974. Later, the self-titled metro station was opened near the building of the terminal. On March 7, 2003, there was the strong fire in the building of the terminal. The part of the building was beyond repair and was demolished.\nAt present day, only one regular passenger line is operational: Novosibirsk - Kudryash island - Yagodnaya - Cheremushki - Novaya Zarya - Bibikha - Sedova Zaimka.

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements are best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artefacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horseheads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone-built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to strong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so-called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century, an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result, local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain-producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two-thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a majority of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna, Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boathouse and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989.

He rose through the ranks from the position of a single partisan unit commander to later become a partisan brigade commander and ending up in charge of all partisan forces in the Orsha region.\n\n\n== Pre-War Biography ==\nIn 1930 he graduated from the Velikiye Luki Railroad Technical College. In 1935 he was appointed assistant chief of a motive power depot in Novosibirsk. In 1937 he transferred to Roslavl to head the Roslavl Locomotive Depot. In 1939 he headed up the Orsha Locomotive Depot.\n\n\n== World War II ==\nWith German troops advancing and approaching Orsha, Zaslonov moved to Moscow and took a job at the Ilyich Locomotive Depot.\nIn October 1941 he volunteered to be deployed in the enemy-occupied territory together with several other railway workers. Once there, he created an underground guerrilla group. His nom de guerre was \"Dyadya Kostya\" (Uncle Konstantin). Members of the group used the so-called \"coal mines\" to blow up 93 German locomotives in a matter of just three months.\nIn March 1942, faced with the threat of an impending arrest, Zaslonov and members of his group left Orsha to set up a partisan unit. The unit conducted a number of successful combat operations in the Vitebsk \u2014 Orsha \u2014 Smolensk area resulting in multiple enemy deaths and destroyed materiel and equipment.\nOn 14 November 1942 Konstantin Zaslonov was killed in a battle with a German death squad near Kupovat, Senno Raion, Vitebsk Oblast, Belorussian SSR.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nOn 7 March 1943 Konstantin Zaslonov was posthumously awarded the title of the \u00abHero of the Soviet Union\u00bb for exemplary execution of the Command's assignments in the fight against German occupiers and for display of valiance and show of heroism (by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR).\nDecorated with two Orders of Lenin and multiple medals.\n\n\n== Memory ==\nA monument to Konstantin Zaslonov was erected in Orsha.

He had two sisters (one older, one younger) and two brothers (both younger).During World War II, the Germans occupied Uzyn, and burned documents including Popovich's birth certificate. After the war, these were restored through witness testimony, and although his mother knew that he was born in 1929, two witnesses insisted that Popovich was born in 1930, and so this became his official year of birth.In 1947, he left vocational school in Bila Tserkva with qualifications as a carpenter. In 1951, Popovich graduated as a construction engineer from a technical school in Magnitogorsk, as well as receiving a pilot's degree.In 1954, he joined the Young Communist League.\nHe was married to Marina Popovich, a retired Soviet Air Force colonel and test pilot. They had two daughters. They later divorced, and Popovich married Alevtina Oshegova.Popovich was also a keen weight lifter:\n\n\"Service in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know that Yuri Gagarin was fond of ice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper. Gherman Titov was a gymnastics enthusiast, Andriyan Nikolayev liked skiing, Pavel Popovich went in for weight lifting. I don't think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.\"He was also a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic 6th\u201311th convocations.After his retirement in 1993, he lived in Moscow.Popovich died in a hospital in Gurzuf where he had been taken following a stroke on 29 September 2009. Brain hemorrhage was cited as the cause of death. He is buried in Moscow.\n\n\n== Military ==\nIn 1952 he graduated from a course at the Stalingrad Military Aviation School near Novosibirsk. He then went on to train at the Military Officers of the Air Force Aviation Training School in Grozny, until 1954 when he joined the Soviet Air Force.\n\n\n=== Service ===\nDetails are from Space Encyclopedia ASTROnote, unless otherwise noted\n\nAircraft types flown:\n\nYakovlev Yak-11\nYakovlev Yak-18\nLavochkin La-9\nMikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15\n\n\n=== Training ===\nDetails are from Space Encyclopedia ASTROnote, unless otherwise noted\n\n\n=== Promotions ===\nDetails are from Space Encyclopedia ASTROnote, unless otherwise noted\n\n\n== Cosmonaut ==\nIn 1960, he was selected as one of the first group of twenty air force pilots that would train as the first cosmonauts for the Soviet space program. The training took place between March 1960 and January 1961, and Popovich passed his final exams in Cosmonaut Basic Training on 17/18 January 1961. He was appointed as an astronaut on 25 January 1961.He was considered as a strong candidate for the first spaceflight \u2013 but while Yuri Gagarin was ultimately chosen for the Vostok 1 flight, Popovich served as the flight's capcom.From May to August 1961, he trained to fly on spacecraft \"Vostok-2\" in a group of astronauts, followed (between September and November 1961) with training to fly \"Vostok-3\". This flight was cancelled. Between November 1961 and May 1962, he trained as a pilot for \"Vostok-4\". Between June and August of that year, he received further training in the maintenance of this spacecraft.\n\nHe commanded the space flight Vostok 4 (Russian: \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a-4) in 1962 which, along with Andrian Nikolayev on Vostok 3, was the first time that more than one manned spacecraft were in orbit at the same time. His call sign for this flight was Golden eagle (\u0411\u0435\u0301\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0442).\nIn January 1964, he became a cosmonaut instructor, becoming deputy commander to the 2nd group of cosmonauts.Popovich was selected to command one of the Soviet Union's planned moon landings, and trained for this between 1966 and 1968, when the Soviet moon landing plans were scrapped.In 1968, he was selected as commander for Soyuz 2, but after the death of Vladimir Komarov during the reentry of Soyuz 1, Soyuz 2 was launched without a crew.\n\nIn 1969 he was a senior cosmonaut instructor, and became (by 1972) the Chief of cosmonaut training.In 1974, he commanded his second (and final) space flight Soyuz 14 (Russian: \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437 14) in 1974. Again, his call sign for this flight was Golden eagle (\u0411\u0435\u0301\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0442). This flight was the first to the Salyut 3 space station.\nIn 1977, he received a post-graduate degree in technical sciences.In March 1978, he was on duty in the Flight Control Center for Vladim\u00edr Remek's flight aboard Soyuz 28.\nFrom 1978 he was the deputy chief of the Gagarin Cosmonauts Training Center responsible for research and testing work. From 1980 to 1989, he was Deputy chief of the Cosmonaut Training Center. In January 1982, he was removed from the list of active cosmonauts, so that he could serve as Deputy Chief for Scientific Testing and Research at the Center.\n\n\n== Sociopolitical life ==\nDetails are from Space Encyclopedia ASTROnote, unless otherwise noted\n\nFrom 1992: Chairman of the Boxing Federation of Russia.\nFrom 1994: President of the Yuri Gagarin Foundation; President of the Social Support for Veterans of the Armed Forces of the Union\nFrom 1996: Member of the Editorial Board of Space News\nFrom 1998: Member of the Editorial Board of the All-Russia scientific and technical magazine Flight\nFrom 1999: President of the Ukrainian Union of Cosmonauts\nMember of the Writers' Union of Russia.\nPresident of the Association of Space Museums of Russia (AMKOS)\nHonorary President of the International Association of Veterans of Physical Education and Sport (MAFIS)\nHonorary Chairman of the Society of Ukrainian Culture (Slavutich)\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nDetails are from Space Encyclopedia ASTROnote, unless otherwise noted\n\nNotes:\n\na For setting records in space flight\nb Medal number 11117\nc For services to the state, many years of fruitful work in the field of culture and art (as President of the Association of Space Museums) (Presidential Decree No. 512 of April 9, 1996)\nd For services to the state and long-term fruitful work (Presidential Decree No. 1724 on October 6, 2000)\ne For significant personal contribution to the development and strengthening of Ukrainian-Russian relations, promoting the rise of the authority of the Ukrainian state in the world (Presidential Decree No.  1682/2005 dated December 1, 2005)\n\n\n=== Other honours ===\nHe received honorary citizenship of several cities:\nIn Russia: Kalugaa, Kovrov, Magnitogorsk (1965), Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk\nIn Ukraine: Poltava, Zaporozhye and Bila Tserkva\nIn Bulgaria: Targovishte\nIn Kazakhstan: GurievNotes:\n\na Popovich is the only person to have received the honorary citizenship of Kaluga twice.

It was perfect triangle shaped and emitted a very bright, white light at a distance of about 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) and an altitude about 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) above the airplane. The object had an estimated speed of 1,500 kilometres per hour (930 mph) travelling parallel to the airplane and passed and overtook the plane in about 30 to 40 seconds.Popovich was the president of the UFO association of Russia.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDetails are from Space Encyclopedia ASTROnote, unless otherwise noted\n\n\n=== Books ===\n\"I Flew in the Morning\" (1974)\n\"Space Humanity\" (1981)\n\"Tested in Space and on Earth\" (1982)\n\"Endless Road Universe\" (1985)\n\"Robinson of the Universe\" (1986)\n\n\n=== Works in Collections ===\n\"Space \u2013 My Job\"\n\"High Orbit\"\n\"Star\"\n\"Conquest of Infinity\"\n\"... 3, 2, 1!\"\n\n\n=== Essays ===\n\"Secrets of the Galaxy\"\n\"Mysteries of the Eternal Cosmos\"\n\"Forward \u2013 to the Sources of the Past\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nColin Burgess; Rex Hall (2009).

        "wiki": "Victory Day Parades (Russian: \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b, tr. Parad Pobedy) are common military parades that are held on 9 May in various post-soviet nations, primarily Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and formerly Ukraine. They are usually held to honor the traditional Victory Day holiday. In 2015, the Ukrainian government had renamed the holiday as \"Victory Day over Nazism in World War II\" as part of decommunization laws. However, even after the change, a vast amount of the populous still honors Ukrainian-Soviet troops who fought in World War II with traditional Victory Day parades.\n\n\n== Victory Parades as a holiday tradition ==\nAs Victory Day is the principal military holiday of Russia and of almost all member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (except the Baltics and Ukraine), the celebrations in Moscow and other capital cities thus serve as national events to mark such an important holiday for millions of people, marking the anniversary of the capitulation of Nazi Germany in 1945. The annual or semiannual parades mark the Allied victory in World War II on the Eastern Front, on the same day as the signing of the German act of capitulation to the victorious Allies in Berlin, at midnight of May 9, 1945 (Soviet time), officially concluding the Second World War in Europe and northern parts of Africa.\n\nDuring the entire history of the Soviet Union, only a total of four parades ever took place in Moscow and throughout the entire Soviet Union. In December 1947, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet under Josef Stalin, decreed that May 9th (Victory Day) would become a working day, effectively making the celebrations cancelled and ceased completely.\nHowever, on April 26, 1965, nearly twenty years after the first parade, under Leonid Brezhnev, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet reversed the actions made in 1947, thus making May 9 a non-working holiday, this would be the first time Victory Day was made as an actual holiday. On May 9, 1965 the second Victory Day parade took place in Moscow, this Victory Day celebration also saw veterans obtain the first jubilee medal for \"Twenty Years of Victory\" in honor of the 20th anniversary since the Allied victory in Europe against Nazi Germany. Further parades would be held in 1985 and 1990.\nUntil 1989 celebrations of Victory Day were held in most Warsaw Pact countries (save for East Germany, whose celebrations fell on 8 May except in 1975, when it was marked on 9 May). Of all the countries that observed it, only Czechoslovakia held celebration parades every 5 years, also in honor of the successful Prague Uprising that ended on that day in 1945. In addition, Poland and Yugoslavia (which was outside the Iron Curtain) also held occasional parades, with the former staging a massive parade in 1985 to mark the ruby jubilee anniversary and the latter following the practice of Czechoslovakia of parades every 5th anniversary beginning with the 20th anniversary in 1965.\nIn 2020, many of the traditional parades were cancelled, with the only ones being held in Belarus and Turkmenistan. The main parade in Russia, as well as parades in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. In response to these massive cancellations, World Health Organization regional director for Europe Hans Kluge referred to these cancellations as \"a brave decision\", highlighting their holiday significance.\n\n\n=== Purpose ===\nAccording to Russian anthropologist Sergey Ushakin, modern victory parades are intended to demonstrate the direct and immediate connection of the present with the past and to materialize the connection between generations. General Oleg Salyukov, who has commanded the parade for close to a decade, described them in an interview with TASS as a \"celebration for people, not show of militarism\" referring to accusations of the parade being used as show of Rusisan military might.\n\n\n== Parades in the Russian Federation ==\n\nToday, Russia, as the largest of the countries of the former Soviet Union, continues the practice of parades held in honor of the victory won in the Great Patriotic War - the Eastern Front of the Second World War as called by the Soviet Union. The first of these parades was held in 1995 (5 years after the fall of the Soviet Union) under the auspices of President Boris Yeltsin, who held the parade to commemorate the golden jubilee of the Soviet and allied victory in the war. The parade was the only one to date that had to be divided into two parts (a full military parade on Poklonnaya Hill and a veterans ceremony on Red Square).\n\n\n=== Red Square, Moscow ===\n\nThe most important parade of those being held on May 9 is the one held on Moscow's Red Square, with the President of Russia as the guest of honor and keynote speaker in virtue of his constitutional mandate as Supreme Commander of the Russian Armed Forces.  On the morning of the day, an estimated 14,000 military personnel, including a regiment of female cadets and youth cadets, assemble by battalions on the square together with the Massed Bands of around 1,100 bandsmen under the direction of the Senior Director of Music of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia (an appointment bestowed to either a colonel or a general rank officer), together with more than 210 vehicles and 3,800 vehicle crews assembled on Tverskaya Street just north of the Manezhnaya Square, Moscow, during the major parades a battalion or company of historical Red Army vehicles, estimated at around 36 vehicles and composed of just the T-34, GAZ-67 and the SU-100 plus the optional BM-13N (or at around an estimated 480 when counting other vehicles of the war which would take part just like in the parades of 1985 and 1990) assemble on the street as well with modern military hardware of the Armed Forces and the National Guard (and optionally by the other uniformed organizations). At the airbases outside Moscow (in areas like Kubinka), more than 88 aircraft are assembled with their aircrews for the flypast segment. Each of the contingents, since 1996, carry historical military colors of the 1942 (Red Army, Soviet Air Force, People's Militia) and 1932/1944 (Navy) patterns at the head of their formations honoring the millions of men and women who served in the ranks of the military and law enforcement services of the former Soviet Union during the long period of the Eastern Front of the Second World War, and the millions among them who were either killed or were missing in action.\nThe celebrations begin at 9:55 am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival of the President and the Prime Minister of Russia to a special grandstand in front of Lenin's Mausoleum, where six of the past parades were reviewed by national leaders. They greet the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service commanders, deputy ministers in the Ministry of Defence and commanders of the support units within the Armed Forces, together with veterans, veterans' families and representatives of the Suvorov and Nakhimov Schools assembled. To the left and right of the grandstand are the stands wherein veterans, veterans' families, and descendants and families of personnel killed in action are gathered. In between the grandstand to the south of the stands are two platoons of armed linemen and markers from the 154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment in the Imperial-styled military uniforms and some unarmed half-companies of the Kremlin Regiment, both of which would be later taking post to mark the distance of the troops marching past and to line the square's western side facing the Kremlin together with extra drum majors from the Band Service, which are there to coordinate the march past to be timed in with the music of the bands since the parade of 1995. At the square, the parade commander (usually a Colonel-General or rarely a General of the Army with the billet of Commander of the Ground Forces or as the Deputy Chief of General Staff) takes his place in a special an Aurus Senat armored limousine (formerly a Zil until 2018), having just received the report on the readiness of the parade from the commandant of the Combined Arms Academy who is a general officer.\nAs the Spasskaya Tower of the Kremlin sounds the chimes at 10 am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms as the 154th PICR's 1st Honor Guard Company Colour Guard, to the melody of The Sacred War being played by the Massed Bands, marches into the square and past the dignitaries with guard carrying both the Flag of Russia and the Victory Banner. As the colour guards approach the grandstand, the colour officers execute eyes left and resume above face after passing by. This is followed by the parade being commanded to stand at ease after the colours take their place at the northwest end of the square fronting the State Historical Museum, besides the colour of the Armed Forces. Then the Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) is driven on the limousine to the center of the square nearest the tribune, the parade presenting arms again at this point. The parade commander informs him of the readiness of the parade to be inspected. The report is received, and to the tune of the Massed Bands, the Minister and the parade commander are driven to inspect the parading contingents each together with the bands. As the limousines stop the Minister sends Victory Day greetings to each of the parading contingents, in which they respond with a threefold loud Oorah that is heard all over the grounds. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands strike up to Slavsya from A Life for the Tsar as the PC returns to his place, the Minister driven to the grandstand amidst loud shouts of Oorah by the parade contingents where he dismounts the limousine and the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's car led by the Commandant of the College and the college colour guard. The parade is ordered to stand at ease after the Minister informs the President that the parade is formed up for the march past in review and its inspection officially completed. In 1965, 1985 and 1990 parades, the limousines would inspect the personnel of the mobile column at the Manezhnaya Square formed into battalions, in remembrance of the mounted inspection of the original 1945 parade, which included cavalry, tachankas and horse artillery in addition to the huge mobile column. Following the report of the Minister of Defence, the keynote holiday address to the nation of the President follows, preceded by a fanfare by the Massed Bands, usually Govovin's Moscow Fanfare. A moment of silence, since 2014, features as part of the keynote address.\nAs the president finishes the address and a threefold Oorah resounds all over the square by the entire parade assembled and the honor guard presents arms, the Massed Bands play the National Anthem of Russia and a ceremonial battery armed with the 76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3) fire a 21-gun salute. As the anthem ends, the bands sound Retreat as the honor guard executes order arms and the parade commander orders the parade to commence the march past in the following manner:\n\nParade... attention! Ceremonial march past!Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!Slope.. arms!As the command is given to start the linemen take their places and the field markers also as well at the south end of the square. As the PC ends the commands with Eyes to the right, forward, quick march! the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, as is their tradition since 1938, march first to the tune of the  \"General Miloradovich\" by one of its late alumni, Lieutenant General Valery Khalilov, one of the longest-serving Senior Directors of Music of the Military Band Service and conductor of the Moscow area massed bands from 2002 to 2016, being played by the drummers and fifers. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums stop playing by the signal of the Corps Drum Major and swings its drumsticks while on the eyes right. The Corps is followed by the colour guard of the 154th PICR and its 1st Honor Guard Company, during jubilee parades, the colour guard is followed by a company of colour bearers carrying the front standards in the order of their marchpast in the 1945 Victory Parade and their escorts, colours from the regiments, brigades, and divisions which took part in the original 1945 parade and a historical unit of servicemen in period uniforms, optionally joined by the Kuban Cossacks, in memory of their contingent which marched past on that very parade, and the Escort Cavalry Squadron of the Kremlin Regiment plus a number of international contingents. This is followed by the rest of the parade ground column, starting with the youth contingents and by the Combined Arms Academy, among other troops.\n\nOnce the ground column ends, the bands stop playing and, to give way to the mobile column by marching towards the facade of the GUM department store. The mobile column starts with the drive past of historical vehicles in jubilee years and only a T-34/85 medium battle tank carrying the Victory Banner non-special anniversary years. Following the end of the mobile column with the service flags of the three branches of the Armed Forces, the flypast then follows, usually as the Bands play the Aviamarch and other air marches. The flypast marks the formal end the parade.\n\n\n=== Russian parades held outside Moscow ===\n\nAs per tradition, 27 other Russian major cities (Sevastopol and Kerch in the disputed Crimea included) are expected to hold commemorative parades on that day (some of them including flypasts and fleet reviews during jubilee years), and joint civil-military parades are hosted by 50 other towns and cities nationwide. Many of these parades are modeled primarily on the Moscow parade, which is the national parade and the highlight of the celebrations, with the local area military unit commander as the parade reviewing officer and the unit executive officer as the parade commander. Military bands are drawn from the local area military unit or educational institution.\nThe following plazas in cities outside of Moscow hold military parades:\n\nPalace Square (St. Petersburg)\nSoviet Square (Smolensk)\nVictory Square (Tula)\nVictory Square (Kaliningrad)\nLenin Square (Voronezh)\nMinin and Pozharsky Square (Nizhny Novgorod)\nFive Corners (Murmansk)\nPrimorskoy Square (Severomorsk)\n1905 Square (Yekaterinburg)\nLenin Square (Novosibirsk)\nKuybyshev Square (Samara)\nTheatre Square (Rostov-on-Don)\nSquare of Fallen Fighters (Volgograd)\nLenin Square (Novorossiysk)\nFreedom Square (Vladikavkaz)\nLenin Square (Astrakhan)\nLenin Square (Stavropol)\nAdmiral Pavel Nakhimov Square (Sevastopol)\nLenin Square (Kerch)\nLenin Square (Simferopol)\nPlatov Square (Novocherkassk)\nLenin Square (Khabarovsk)\nShip Embankment (Vladivostok)\nCentral Square (Ussuriysk)\nCentral Square (Belogorsk)\nLenin Square (Chita)\nCouncil Square (Ulan-Ude)\nGlory Square (Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk)Like Moscow, regional parades in recent years have included foreign troops in their parades. On the 65th anniversary in 2010, French troops took part in a parade in Murmansk while American sailors paraded in Vladivostok. This occurred once again in 2013 in Vladivostok during which American Pacific Fleet troops and sailors from the French Navy took part in the 68th anniversary parade, greeting the parade inspector in their native languages before sounding a Russian-style threefold \"Ura!\" Foreign cadet contingents also take part in the parade in St. Petersburg and Omsk. In 2020, it was confirmed that foreign servicemen from the armed forces of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan will take part in the parade in Yekaterinburg, as well a 80-man contingent from Armenia in Rostov-on-Don, plans which were later scrapped. During the annual parade at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria, a unit from the Syrian Arab Armed Forces usually participates in the parade.In 2004, during a victory parade in the Chechen city of Grozny, a bomb exploded, killing 10 people including the Chechen President Akhmad Kadyrov.\n\n\n==== Palace Square, St. Petersburg ====\nThe first Victory parade in the city was the Parade of Guards (Russian: \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a) on 8 July 1945 was held in Leningrad in the presence of at least half a million Leningraders. The parade consisted of servicemen from guards units of the Leningrad Front, all of which marched on Nevsky Prospect. On 9 May 1965, the first parade celebration of the 20th anniversary of the victory took place on the Palace Square grounds.\n\n\n==== Ship Embankment, Vladivostok ====\nVictory Parades in Vladivostok first began in 1965. Despite this it is generally considered that the first parade in honor of the victory in Vladivostok on Svetlanskaya Street took place in 1918 dedicated to the First World War, attended by British, American and French troops. Svetlanskaya later went on to host ten victory parades, held infrequently. The traditional part of parade was reduced to the construction of areas of the central square, which resulted in parades, such as one in 2009, being held under the monument to the Red Army soldier. In 2011, the victory parade in Vladivostok moved from the central square to Ship Embankment, which was a contreversial move that caused debate. Since 2012, official Victory Parades have been held annually on the street.\n\n\n==== Lenin Square, Khabarovsk ====\nThe parade in the city of Khabarovsk is the main one in the Eastern Military District. In 2019, the American Sherman Tank took part in the mobile column of the parade for the first time, after over a year of restoration work after being found by divers at the bottom of the Barents Sea.\n\n\n==== 1905 Square, Yekaterinburg ====\nUnlike other cities, parades in Yekaterinburg (known in the Soviet era as Sverdlovsk) weren't held until 1975, a year when the parade in Moscow wasn't event being held despite it being a jubilee year. Another parade was held on 1905 Square in 1980. Parades returned in 1992, after the merger/creation of the Volga\u2013Ural Military District caused large-scale parades in the region to be moved to Samara. In 2005, Yekaterinburg was one of three cities in Russia (along with Moscow and Krasnoyarsk), where heavy military equipment directly took part in the parade. The record number of military equipment participating in the parade was recorded in 2010. In 2015, aircraft were first introduced into the parade.\n\n\n== History of parades in different countries ==\n\n\n=== Parades held in recognized nations ===\n\n\n==== Republic of Armenia ====\nAnnual victory day parades in Armenia are held in Gyumri on the central square of the city, being presided by the Commander-in-Chief of the United Group of Forces and taking place with the participation of troops from the Russian 102nd Military Base, the Leninakan Border Detachment of the Federal Security Service of Russia, and military personnel of the Armed Forces of Armenia. Officials in attendance are the Governor of the Shirak Region, the Mayor of Gyumri, and the Bishop of the Diocese of Shirak. In 2015, pilots of the Russian airbase in Armenia participated in a flypast over Gyrumi and Yerevan for the first time in honor of the platinum jubilee. Because the 2020 celebrations in honor of the holiday and Shushi Liberation Day were cancelled by order of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan due to the Covid 19 pandemic, a fly past of the Armenian Air Force was held at the Mother Armenia monument.\n\n\n==== Republic of Belarus ====\n\nVictory parades in Belarus have dated back to Soviet parades in the former Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. They are usually held on jubilee years (e.g. 50th anniversary, 65th anniversary).\n\n\n==== Czechoslovakia ====\n\nDuring the period of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, regular victory day parades were held by the Czechoslovak People's Army (\u010cSLA) in Letn\u00e1.

Kde domov m\u016fj (the Czechoslovakian national anthem) was performed by the massed bands on parade before being followed by the State Anthem of the Soviet Union. Parades were also held in Bratislava and Pilsen as well.\n\n\n==== State of Israel ====\nIsrael has commemorated Victory Day since it became a national holiday in 2017. As a result of the mass immigration of many Red Army veterans, Israel now hosts the largest and most extensive Victory Day celebrations outside the former Soviet space. The traditions and customs of Victory Day are the same as in Russia, with marches of Immortal Regiments held in cities with large populations of Red Army veterans and their descendants, particularly in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa. It does not just honor all who served in the European and Mediterranean Theaters, but also particularly honors the Jewish partisans and soldiers who served in the armed forces and paramilitary formations, as well as of the civil uniformed security forces, of the Allies, whose experience would help in the formation of the current day Israel Defense Forces.\n\n\n==== Republic of Kazakhstan ====\n\nThe first Victory Day Parade in Kazakhstan was held in 1995 in the then capital of Almaty. Celebrating the golden jubilee of the victory, it was held on Republic Square and was presided by the Minister of Defence, Army General Sagadat Nurmagambetov. Subsequent small-scale parades were held in 2000 and 2005. In 2015, a Victory Day/Defender of the Fatherland Day Parade was held on Independence Square in Nur-Sultan (then known as Astana) to celebrate the victory's platinum jubilee. As a result, most Victory Day parades are held in connection with Defender of the Fatherland Day holiday, which celebrates the founding of the Kazakh Armed Forces. In the wake of the Coronavirus outbreak in March 2020, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev ordered the cancellation of that year's parade due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that affected the country. On 24 June of that year, the city of Almaty held a mini Victory Parade.In Aktau, the parade traditionally begins with the \"Volley of Remembrance\", fired near the Eternal Flame monument.\n\n\n==== Kyrgyz Republic ====\nThe only major Victory Day Parade in Bishkek occurred in 2015 on Ala-Too Square. It was presided by Prime Minister Temir Sariyev and Chief of General Staff Asanbek Alymkozhoev in place of President Almazbek Atambayev, who was attending the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade. Russian troops from the Kant Air Base also took part in the parade. In 2020, a planned parade due to be held at the same venue to mark the war's 75th anniversary was cancelled.On normal occasions, a short victory parade led by the Commander of the Bishkek Garrison is held at Victory Square.\n\n\n==== Republic of Moldova ====\nOn 15 April 2020, Moldovan President Igor Dodon ordered the postponement of the diamond jubilee Victory Day celebrations on 9 May, the main event of which was supposed to be the Victory Parade on Great National Assembly Square, to Liberation Day (24 August) due to the coronavirus pandemic in Moldova.\n\n\n==== Serbia /Yugoslavia ====\n\nVictory Day Parades in Serbia and the former Yugoslavia are held frequently, the first of which was held by the Yugoslav People's Army on Bulevar revolucije in 1965, during the 20th anniversary. After that parade, it was held every 5 years. The last victory parade in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was held on the ruby jubilee in 1985 (branded as Parade 85).

This was the first ever Victory Parade to be held since Turkmen independence was attained. Soldiers of the Armed Forces of Turkmenistan took part in the parade, which was held at a square in front of the Halk Hakydasy Memorial Complex in the capital of Ashgabat, with a special appearance by Russian Deputy Minister of Defence Alexander Fomin.

The parade was held in spite of the coronavirus pandemic in the country and was one of two parades being held that year in the former Soviet Union, with the other being in Minsk.\n\n\n==== Ukraine ====\n\nUkraine, as the second-largest former Soviet republic in terms of population, has some of the largest and most frequent victory parades, honoring the estimated 1,377,400 Ukrainian servicemen and women of the Soviet Armed Forces and personnel from paramilitary partisan formations who lost their lives fighting against Wehrmacht troops together with forces from the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. The first official proposal to celebrate Victory Day with a parade appeared at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine on 27 March 1945. The first military parade sice the liberation of Kyiv was held on International Workers Day (1 May), being dubbed in the local media as a \"Victory Parade\". The parade took place on Korolenko Street (now Vladimirskaya). During the latter half of the Ukrainian SSR's existence, parades were held in 1965 and 1990, with the planned 1985 parade being cancelled. The first parade was held in 1995 to celebrate the golden jubilee, and was held again in 2001, 2010, and 2011 until the last formal parade took place in 2013. The planned parade was cancelled for the first time in 2014 by order of the Kiev City State Administration in light of the start Russo-Ukrainian War and the holiday's Russian connotations.Although Victory Day as a holiday has been altered completely and was recreated as a completely different national holiday following the events of the 2013-14 Euromaidan (known today as the Victory Day over Nazism in World War II), many Ukrainians still honor veterans in the traditional Victory Day style in terms of protocol. Only in the separatist-controlled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, since 2015, do the people completely celebrate the traditional Victory Day parades with military vehicles and soldiers marching past the main squares of the two citiesm Parades have also been held on a regular basis in the cities of Odessa, Kharkiv, and Lviv, usually taking the form of a small march past nowadays rather than a full ceremony.\n\n\n=== Parades held in partly recognized states ===\n\n\n==== Republic of Abkhazia ====\nVictory parades have been held in Abkhazia annually since 2009.

Located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River, it is the third-most populous city in Russia (after Moscow and St. Petersburg) as well as the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,612,833 as of the 2018 census.Novosibirsk was founded in 1893 on the Ob River crossing point of the future Trans-Siberian Railway. Originally named Novonikolayevsk, it grew rapidly into a major transport, commercial and industrial hub. The city was ravaged by the Russian Civil War but recovered during the early Soviet period, and gained its present name in 1926. Under Stalin, Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of World War II the city hosted many factories relocated from European Russia.\nNovosibirsk is home to the headquarters of numerous Russian corporations, as well as the world-renowned Novosibirsk Zoo. It is served by Tolmachevo Airport, the busiest airport in Siberia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNovosibirsk, founded in 1893 at the future site of a Trans-Siberian Railway bridge crossing the great Siberian river of Ob, was at first named Novonikolayevsk (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a), in honor both of Saint Nicholas and of the reigning Tsar Nicholas II. It superseded nearby Krivoshchekovskaya village, which was founded in 1696. The bridge was completed in the spring of 1897, making the new settlement the regional transport hub. The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway in the early 20th century. The new railway connected Novonikolayevsk to Central Asia and the Caspian Sea.At the time of the bridge's opening, Novonikolayevsk had a population of 7,800 people. The frontier settlement developed rapidly. Its first bank opened in 1906, and a total of five banks were operating by 1915. In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the pre-revolutionary period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000. The city had steady and rapid economic growth, becoming one of the largest commercial and industrial centers of Siberia. It developed a significant agricultural processing industry, as well as a power station, iron foundry, commodity market, several banks, and commercial and shipping companies. By 1917, seven Orthodox churches and one Roman Catholic Church had been built there, along with several cinemas, forty primary schools, a high school, a teaching seminary, and the Romanov House non-classical secondary school. In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.The Russian Civil War took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially that of typhus and cholera, claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city's history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the White Guards, captured Novonikolayevsk. The Red Army took the city in 1919, retaining it throughout the rest of the Civil War.Novonikolayevsk began reconstruction in 1921 at the start of Lenin's New Economic Policy period. It was a part of Tomsk Governorate and served as its administrative center from December 23, 1919 to March 14, 1920. Between June 13, 1921 and May 25, 1925, it served as the administrative center of Novonikolayevsk Governorate, which was separated from Tomsk Governorate. The city was given its present name on September 12, 1926.When governorates were abolished, the city served as the administrative center of Siberian Krai until July 23, 1930, and of West Siberian Krai until September 28, 1937, when that krai was split into Novosibirsk Oblast and Altai Krai. Since then, it has served as the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast.The Monument to the Heroes of the Revolution was erected in the center of the city and has been one of the chief historic sites (essentially every child had to visit the monument on school field trips during the Soviet years). Neglect in the 1990s while other areas were redeveloped helped preserve it in the post-Soviet era.During Joseph Stalin's industrialization effort, Novosibirsk secured its place as one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Several massive industrial facilities were created, including the 'Sibkombain' plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally a metal processing plant, a food processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new power station. The great Soviet famine of 1932\u201333 resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk. They were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city, giving rise to slums.Its rapid growth and industrialization led to Novosibirsk being nicknamed the \"Chicago of Siberia\".Tram rails were laid down in 1934, by which time the population had reached 287,000, making Novosibirsk the largest city in Siberia. The following year the original bridge over the Ob River was replaced by the new Kommunalny bridge.Between 1941 and 1942 more than 50 substantial factories were crated up and relocated from western Russia to Novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through war, and at this time the city became a major supply base for the Red Army. During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.\nThe rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 400 megawatts, necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the Ob Sea. As a direct result of the station's construction, vast areas of fertile land were flooded as were relic pine woods in the area; additionally, the new open space created by the reservoir's surface caused average wind speeds to double, increasing the rate of soil erosion.In the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed that a center for scientific research be built in Novosibirsk, and in 1957 the multi-facility scientific research complex of Akademgorodok was constructed about 30 km (19 mi) south of the city center. The Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (formerly the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them Novosibirsk State University, one of the top Russian schools in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.\nOn September 2, 1962, the population of Novosibirsk reached one million. At that time, it was the youngest city in the world with over a million people.

This is an increase compared to the 2010 census, when the population of the city was 1,473,754.People from over eighty ethnicities and nationalities reside in Novosibirsk. The largest groups are Russian, Yakut, German, Ukrainian, Tatar, Jewish, and Belarusian.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe best-known trees native to Novosibirsk are birch, pine, and aspen. Some mountain ash, hawthorn, spruce, and fir are also present. European species of apple, ash, elm, linden, and oak have been successfully introduced.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe city stands on the banks of the Ob River in the West Siberian Plain. To the south of the city lies the Priobskoye Plateau. The nearest major cities are Krasnoyarsk, Omsk and Nur-Sultan.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in Novosibirsk is typical of Siberia, with dry winters and far-below-freezing winter temperatures. The reason for these temperatures is the absence of a nearby ocean, the Ural Mountains barring Atlantic air masses from reaching Siberia, and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds. In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being \u00dcr\u00fcmqi in China.\nThe climate is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Novosibirsk is frequently cloudy in the winter due to the collision of Atlantic and Siberian air masses. Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from +15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) to +26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and in winter from \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) to \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F). However, winter temperatures can go as low as \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F) to \u221235 \u00b0C (\u221231 \u00b0F), and summer temperatures can go as high as +30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) to +35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The difference between the highest- and lowest-recorded temperatures is 82 \u00b0C (148 \u00b0F).\nTravellers coming from countries with mild climates may find Novosibirsk's winter tough, but it may not be extraordinary for those from northern countries. At times, bitter cold may hold for some days, but temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and lower do not occur every year.\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\nNovosibirsk is home to Russia's most powerful shortwave relay station east of the Ural mountains. This relay station can reach most of South Asia, the Middle East, and China. The Magadan and Vladivostok relay stations when operated in conjunction with Novosibirsk can guarantee that the Voice of Russia or any other broadcaster renting time at Novosibirsk is heard in the intended target area.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== International and intercity transportation ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nThe city is served by Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport.

Located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River, it is the third-most populous city in Russia (after Moscow and St. Petersburg) as well as the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,612,833 as of the 2018 census.Novosibirsk was founded in 1893 on the Ob River crossing point of the future Trans-Siberian Railway. Originally named Novonikolayevsk, it grew rapidly into a major transport, commercial and industrial hub. The city was ravaged by the Russian Civil War but recovered during the early Soviet period, and gained its present name in 1926. Under Stalin, Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of World War II the city hosted many factories relocated from European Russia.\nNovosibirsk is home to the headquarters of numerous Russian corporations, as well as the world-renowned Novosibirsk Zoo. It is served by Tolmachevo Airport, the busiest airport in Siberia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNovosibirsk, founded in 1893 at the future site of a Trans-Siberian Railway bridge crossing the great Siberian river of Ob, was at first named Novonikolayevsk (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a), in honor both of Saint Nicholas and of the reigning Tsar Nicholas II. It superseded nearby Krivoshchekovskaya village, which was founded in 1696. The bridge was completed in the spring of 1897, making the new settlement the regional transport hub. The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway in the early 20th century. The new railway connected Novonikolayevsk to Central Asia and the Caspian Sea.At the time of the bridge's opening, Novonikolayevsk had a population of 7,800 people. The frontier settlement developed rapidly. Its first bank opened in 1906, and a total of five banks were operating by 1915. In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the pre-revolutionary period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000. The city had steady and rapid economic growth, becoming one of the largest commercial and industrial centers of Siberia. It developed a significant agricultural processing industry, as well as a power station, iron foundry, commodity market, several banks, and commercial and shipping companies. By 1917, seven Orthodox churches and one Roman Catholic Church had been built there, along with several cinemas, forty primary schools, a high school, a teaching seminary, and the Romanov House non-classical secondary school. In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.The Russian Civil War took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially that of typhus and cholera, claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city's history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the White Guards, captured Novonikolayevsk. The Red Army took the city in 1919, retaining it throughout the rest of the Civil War.Novonikolayevsk began reconstruction in 1921 at the start of Lenin's New Economic Policy period. It was a part of Tomsk Governorate and served as its administrative center from December 23, 1919 to March 14, 1920. Between June 13, 1921 and May 25, 1925, it served as the administrative center of Novonikolayevsk Governorate, which was separated from Tomsk Governorate. The city was given its present name on September 12, 1926.When governorates were abolished, the city served as the administrative center of Siberian Krai until July 23, 1930, and of West Siberian Krai until September 28, 1937, when that krai was split into Novosibirsk Oblast and Altai Krai. Since then, it has served as the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast.The Monument to the Heroes of the Revolution was erected in the center of the city and has been one of the chief historic sites (essentially every child had to visit the monument on school field trips during the Soviet years). Neglect in the 1990s while other areas were redeveloped helped preserve it in the post-Soviet era.During Joseph Stalin's industrialization effort, Novosibirsk secured its place as one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Several massive industrial facilities were created, including the 'Sibkombain' plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally a metal processing plant, a food processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new power station. The great Soviet famine of 1932\u201333 resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk. They were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city, giving rise to slums.Its rapid growth and industrialization led to Novosibirsk being nicknamed the \"Chicago of Siberia\".Tram rails were laid down in 1934, by which time the population had reached 287,000, making Novosibirsk the largest city in Siberia. The following year the original bridge over the Ob River was replaced by the new Kommunalny bridge.Between 1941 and 1942 more than 50 substantial factories were crated up and relocated from western Russia to Novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through war, and at this time the city became a major supply base for the Red Army. During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.\nThe rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 400 megawatts, necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the Ob Sea. As a direct result of the station's construction, vast areas of fertile land were flooded as were relic pine woods in the area; additionally, the new open space created by the reservoir's surface caused average wind speeds to double, increasing the rate of soil erosion.In the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed that a center for scientific research be built in Novosibirsk, and in 1957 the multi-facility scientific research complex of Akademgorodok was constructed about 30 km (19 mi) south of the city center. The Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (formerly the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them Novosibirsk State University, one of the top Russian schools in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.\nOn September 2, 1962, the population of Novosibirsk reached one million. At that time, it was the youngest city in the world with over a million people. Novosibirsk took fewer than seventy years to achieve this milestone.In 1979, work began on the Novosibirsk Metro Transit System, culminating in the opening of the first line in 1985.On August 1, 2008, Novosibirsk was in the center of the path of a solar eclipse, with a duration of 2 minutes and 20 seconds.\nThe city appeared in the 2019 game Metro Exodus.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nNovosibirsk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Novosibirsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Novosibirsk\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Novosibirsk is incorporated as Novosibirsk Urban Okrug.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nDzerzhinsky (\u0414\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKalininsky (\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKirovsky (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nLeninsky (\u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nOktyabrsky (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nPervomaysky (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nSovetsky (\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nTsentralny (\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439)\nZayeltsovsky (\u0417\u0430\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nZheleznodorozhny (\u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the Federal State Statistics Service, in January 2015 the number of residents came to 1,567,087. This is an increase compared to the 2010 census, when the population of the city was 1,473,754.People from over eighty ethnicities and nationalities reside in Novosibirsk. The largest groups are Russian, Yakut, German, Ukrainian, Tatar, Jewish, and Belarusian.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe best-known trees native to Novosibirsk are birch, pine, and aspen. Some mountain ash, hawthorn, spruce, and fir are also present. European species of apple, ash, elm, linden, and oak have been successfully introduced.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe city stands on the banks of the Ob River in the West Siberian Plain. To the south of the city lies the Priobskoye Plateau. The nearest major cities are Krasnoyarsk, Omsk and Nur-Sultan.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in Novosibirsk is typical of Siberia, with dry winters and far-below-freezing winter temperatures. The reason for these temperatures is the absence of a nearby ocean, the Ural Mountains barring Atlantic air masses from reaching Siberia, and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds. In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being \u00dcr\u00fcmqi in China.\nThe climate is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Novosibirsk is frequently cloudy in the winter due to the collision of Atlantic and Siberian air masses. Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from +15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) to +26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and in winter from \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) to \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F). However, winter temperatures can go as low as \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F) to \u221235 \u00b0C (\u221231 \u00b0F), and summer temperatures can go as high as +30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) to +35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The difference between the highest- and lowest-recorded temperatures is 82 \u00b0C (148 \u00b0F).\nTravellers coming from countries with mild climates may find Novosibirsk's winter tough, but it may not be extraordinary for those from northern countries. At times, bitter cold may hold for some days, but temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and lower do not occur every year.\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\nNovosibirsk is home to Russia's most powerful shortwave relay station east of the Ural mountains. This relay station can reach most of South Asia, the Middle East, and China. The Magadan and Vladivostok relay stations when operated in conjunction with Novosibirsk can guarantee that the Voice of Russia or any other broadcaster renting time at Novosibirsk is heard in the intended target area.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== International and intercity transportation ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nThe city is served by Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport.

The main railway station of Novosibirsk is Novosibirsk-Glavny station (\"Glavny\" means \"Main\") which is located in the centre of the right bank part of the city. There are also Novosibirsk-Zapadny (\"Zapadny\" means \"Western\"), Novosibirsk-Vostochny (\"Vostochny\" means \"Eastern\"), and Novosibirsk-Yuzhny (\"Yuzhny\" means \"Southern\") railway stations in Novosibirsk. All intercity trains passing through the aforementioned stations stop at these stations. In addition, there are halts where only suburban trains stops, for example Inskaya, Seyatel, Razyezd Inya, and many others.\nThe many regular intercity trains connect Novosibirsk with Russian cities in Siberia, the Far East, Ural, and European Russia. International trains allow to get to China, Mongolia, Belarus, and countries in Central Asia.\n\n\n==== Bus stations ====\nThe old Novosibirsk Bus Station located on Krasny Avenue in the right bank part of the city near Kommunalny Bridge was opened in 1964 and eventually closed on 6 April 2020. There is a plan to build some new bus stations on the periphery of the city; the first of these new bus stations was built on Gusinobrodskoe \u0421haussee and was opened on 18 December 2019.

Located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River, it is the third-most populous city in Russia (after Moscow and St. Petersburg) as well as the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,612,833 as of the 2018 census.Novosibirsk was founded in 1893 on the Ob River crossing point of the future Trans-Siberian Railway. Originally named Novonikolayevsk, it grew rapidly into a major transport, commercial and industrial hub. The city was ravaged by the Russian Civil War but recovered during the early Soviet period, and gained its present name in 1926. Under Stalin, Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of World War II the city hosted many factories relocated from European Russia.\nNovosibirsk is home to the headquarters of numerous Russian corporations, as well as the world-renowned Novosibirsk Zoo. It is served by Tolmachevo Airport, the busiest airport in Siberia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNovosibirsk, founded in 1893 at the future site of a Trans-Siberian Railway bridge crossing the great Siberian river of Ob, was at first named Novonikolayevsk (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a), in honor both of Saint Nicholas and of the reigning Tsar Nicholas II. It superseded nearby Krivoshchekovskaya village, which was founded in 1696. The bridge was completed in the spring of 1897, making the new settlement the regional transport hub. The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway in the early 20th century. The new railway connected Novonikolayevsk to Central Asia and the Caspian Sea.At the time of the bridge's opening, Novonikolayevsk had a population of 7,800 people. The frontier settlement developed rapidly. Its first bank opened in 1906, and a total of five banks were operating by 1915. In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the pre-revolutionary period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000. The city had steady and rapid economic growth, becoming one of the largest commercial and industrial centers of Siberia. It developed a significant agricultural processing industry, as well as a power station, iron foundry, commodity market, several banks, and commercial and shipping companies. By 1917, seven Orthodox churches and one Roman Catholic Church had been built there, along with several cinemas, forty primary schools, a high school, a teaching seminary, and the Romanov House non-classical secondary school. In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.The Russian Civil War took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially that of typhus and cholera, claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city's history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the White Guards, captured Novonikolayevsk. The Red Army took the city in 1919, retaining it throughout the rest of the Civil War.Novonikolayevsk began reconstruction in 1921 at the start of Lenin's New Economic Policy period. It was a part of Tomsk Governorate and served as its administrative center from December 23, 1919 to March 14, 1920. Between June 13, 1921 and May 25, 1925, it served as the administrative center of Novonikolayevsk Governorate, which was separated from Tomsk Governorate. The city was given its present name on September 12, 1926.When governorates were abolished, the city served as the administrative center of Siberian Krai until July 23, 1930, and of West Siberian Krai until September 28, 1937, when that krai was split into Novosibirsk Oblast and Altai Krai. Since then, it has served as the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast.The Monument to the Heroes of the Revolution was erected in the center of the city and has been one of the chief historic sites (essentially every child had to visit the monument on school field trips during the Soviet years). Neglect in the 1990s while other areas were redeveloped helped preserve it in the post-Soviet era.During Joseph Stalin's industrialization effort, Novosibirsk secured its place as one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Several massive industrial facilities were created, including the 'Sibkombain' plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally a metal processing plant, a food processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new power station. The great Soviet famine of 1932\u201333 resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk. They were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city, giving rise to slums.Its rapid growth and industrialization led to Novosibirsk being nicknamed the \"Chicago of Siberia\".Tram rails were laid down in 1934, by which time the population had reached 287,000, making Novosibirsk the largest city in Siberia. The following year the original bridge over the Ob River was replaced by the new Kommunalny bridge.Between 1941 and 1942 more than 50 substantial factories were crated up and relocated from western Russia to Novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through war, and at this time the city became a major supply base for the Red Army. During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.\nThe rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 400 megawatts, necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the Ob Sea. As a direct result of the station's construction, vast areas of fertile land were flooded as were relic pine woods in the area; additionally, the new open space created by the reservoir's surface caused average wind speeds to double, increasing the rate of soil erosion.In the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed that a center for scientific research be built in Novosibirsk, and in 1957 the multi-facility scientific research complex of Akademgorodok was constructed about 30 km (19 mi) south of the city center. The Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (formerly the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them Novosibirsk State University, one of the top Russian schools in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.\nOn September 2, 1962, the population of Novosibirsk reached one million. At that time, it was the youngest city in the world with over a million people. Novosibirsk took fewer than seventy years to achieve this milestone.In 1979, work began on the Novosibirsk Metro Transit System, culminating in the opening of the first line in 1985.On August 1, 2008, Novosibirsk was in the center of the path of a solar eclipse, with a duration of 2 minutes and 20 seconds.\nThe city appeared in the 2019 game Metro Exodus.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nNovosibirsk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Novosibirsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Novosibirsk\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Novosibirsk is incorporated as Novosibirsk Urban Okrug.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nDzerzhinsky (\u0414\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKalininsky (\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKirovsky (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nLeninsky (\u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nOktyabrsky (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nPervomaysky (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nSovetsky (\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nTsentralny (\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439)\nZayeltsovsky (\u0417\u0430\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nZheleznodorozhny (\u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the Federal State Statistics Service, in January 2015 the number of residents came to 1,567,087. This is an increase compared to the 2010 census, when the population of the city was 1,473,754.People from over eighty ethnicities and nationalities reside in Novosibirsk. The largest groups are Russian, Yakut, German, Ukrainian, Tatar, Jewish, and Belarusian.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe best-known trees native to Novosibirsk are birch, pine, and aspen. Some mountain ash, hawthorn, spruce, and fir are also present. European species of apple, ash, elm, linden, and oak have been successfully introduced.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe city stands on the banks of the Ob River in the West Siberian Plain. To the south of the city lies the Priobskoye Plateau. The nearest major cities are Krasnoyarsk, Omsk and Nur-Sultan.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in Novosibirsk is typical of Siberia, with dry winters and far-below-freezing winter temperatures. The reason for these temperatures is the absence of a nearby ocean, the Ural Mountains barring Atlantic air masses from reaching Siberia, and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds. In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being \u00dcr\u00fcmqi in China.\nThe climate is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Novosibirsk is frequently cloudy in the winter due to the collision of Atlantic and Siberian air masses. Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from +15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) to +26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and in winter from \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) to \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F). However, winter temperatures can go as low as \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F) to \u221235 \u00b0C (\u221231 \u00b0F), and summer temperatures can go as high as +30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) to +35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The difference between the highest- and lowest-recorded temperatures is 82 \u00b0C (148 \u00b0F).\nTravellers coming from countries with mild climates may find Novosibirsk's winter tough, but it may not be extraordinary for those from northern countries. At times, bitter cold may hold for some days, but temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and lower do not occur every year.\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\nNovosibirsk is home to Russia's most powerful shortwave relay station east of the Ural mountains. This relay station can reach most of South Asia, the Middle East, and China. The Magadan and Vladivostok relay stations when operated in conjunction with Novosibirsk can guarantee that the Voice of Russia or any other broadcaster renting time at Novosibirsk is heard in the intended target area.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== International and intercity transportation ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nThe city is served by Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport.

The word derives from the Latin liber, \u201cbook,\u201d whereas a Latinized Greek word, bibliotheca, is the origin of the word for library in German, Russian, and the Romance languages.From their historical beginnings as places to keep the business, legal, historical, and religious records of a civilization, libraries have emerged since the middle of the 20th century as a far-reaching body of information resources and services that do not even require a building. Rapid developments in computers, telecommunications, and other technologies have made it possible to store and retrieve information in many different forms and from any place with a computer and a telephone connection. The terms digital library and virtual library have begun to be used to refer to the vast collections of information to which people gain access over the Internet, cable television, or some other type of remote electronic connection.This article provides a history of libraries from their founding in the ancient world through the latter half of the 20th century, when both technological and political forces radically reshaped library development. It offers an overview of several types of traditional libraries and explains how libraries collect, organize, and make accessible their collections. Further discussion of the application of the theory and technology of information science in libraries and related fields is included in the article information processing. ",

Located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River, it is the third-most populous city in Russia (after Moscow and St. Petersburg) as well as the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,612,833 as of the 2018 census.Novosibirsk was founded in 1893 on the Ob River crossing point of the future Trans-Siberian Railway. Originally named Novonikolayevsk, it grew rapidly into a major transport, commercial and industrial hub. The city was ravaged by the Russian Civil War but recovered during the early Soviet period, and gained its present name in 1926. Under Stalin, Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of World War II the city hosted many factories relocated from European Russia.\nNovosibirsk is home to the headquarters of numerous Russian corporations, as well as the world-renowned Novosibirsk Zoo. It is served by Tolmachevo Airport, the busiest airport in Siberia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNovosibirsk, founded in 1893 at the future site of a Trans-Siberian Railway bridge crossing the great Siberian river of Ob, was at first named Novonikolayevsk (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a), in honor both of Saint Nicholas and of the reigning Tsar Nicholas II. It superseded nearby Krivoshchekovskaya village, which was founded in 1696. The bridge was completed in the spring of 1897, making the new settlement the regional transport hub. The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway in the early 20th century. The new railway connected Novonikolayevsk to Central Asia and the Caspian Sea.At the time of the bridge's opening, Novonikolayevsk had a population of 7,800 people. The frontier settlement developed rapidly. Its first bank opened in 1906, and a total of five banks were operating by 1915. In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the pre-revolutionary period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000. The city had steady and rapid economic growth, becoming one of the largest commercial and industrial centers of Siberia. It developed a significant agricultural processing industry, as well as a power station, iron foundry, commodity market, several banks, and commercial and shipping companies. By 1917, seven Orthodox churches and one Roman Catholic Church had been built there, along with several cinemas, forty primary schools, a high school, a teaching seminary, and the Romanov House non-classical secondary school. In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.The Russian Civil War took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially that of typhus and cholera, claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city's history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the White Guards, captured Novonikolayevsk. The Red Army took the city in 1919, retaining it throughout the rest of the Civil War.Novonikolayevsk began reconstruction in 1921 at the start of Lenin's New Economic Policy period. It was a part of Tomsk Governorate and served as its administrative center from December 23, 1919 to March 14, 1920. Between June 13, 1921 and May 25, 1925, it served as the administrative center of Novonikolayevsk Governorate, which was separated from Tomsk Governorate. The city was given its present name on September 12, 1926.When governorates were abolished, the city served as the administrative center of Siberian Krai until July 23, 1930, and of West Siberian Krai until September 28, 1937, when that krai was split into Novosibirsk Oblast and Altai Krai. Since then, it has served as the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast.The Monument to the Heroes of the Revolution was erected in the center of the city and has been one of the chief historic sites (essentially every child had to visit the monument on school field trips during the Soviet years). Neglect in the 1990s while other areas were redeveloped helped preserve it in the post-Soviet era.During Joseph Stalin's industrialization effort, Novosibirsk secured its place as one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Several massive industrial facilities were created, including the 'Sibkombain' plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally a metal processing plant, a food processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new power station. The great Soviet famine of 1932\u201333 resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk. They were settled in barracks at the outskirts of the city, giving rise to slums.Its rapid growth and industrialization led to Novosibirsk being nicknamed the \"Chicago of Siberia\".Tram rails were laid down in 1934, by which time the population had reached 287,000, making Novosibirsk the largest city in Siberia. The following year the original bridge over the Ob River was replaced by the new Kommunalny bridge.Between 1941 and 1942 more than 50 substantial factories were crated up and relocated from western Russia to Novosibirsk in order to reduce the risk of their destruction through war, and at this time the city became a major supply base for the Red Army. During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.\nThe rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 400 megawatts, necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the Ob Sea. As a direct result of the station's construction, vast areas of fertile land were flooded as were relic pine woods in the area; additionally, the new open space created by the reservoir's surface caused average wind speeds to double, increasing the rate of soil erosion.In the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed that a center for scientific research be built in Novosibirsk, and in 1957 the multi-facility scientific research complex of Akademgorodok was constructed about 30 km (19 mi) south of the city center. The Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (formerly the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them Novosibirsk State University, one of the top Russian schools in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.\nOn September 2, 1962, the population of Novosibirsk reached one million. At that time, it was the youngest city in the world with over a million people. Novosibirsk took fewer than seventy years to achieve this milestone.In 1979, work began on the Novosibirsk Metro Transit System, culminating in the opening of the first line in 1985.On August 1, 2008, Novosibirsk was in the center of the path of a solar eclipse, with a duration of 2 minutes and 20 seconds.\nThe city appeared in the 2019 game Metro Exodus.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\n\nNovosibirsk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Novosibirsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Novosibirsk\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Novosibirsk is incorporated as Novosibirsk Urban Okrug.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nDzerzhinsky (\u0414\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKalininsky (\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nKirovsky (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nLeninsky (\u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nOktyabrsky (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nPervomaysky (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nSovetsky (\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nTsentralny (\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439)\nZayeltsovsky (\u0417\u0430\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\nZheleznodorozhny (\u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the Federal State Statistics Service, in January 2015 the number of residents came to 1,567,087. This is an increase compared to the 2010 census, when the population of the city was 1,473,754.People from over eighty ethnicities and nationalities reside in Novosibirsk. The largest groups are Russian, Yakut, German, Ukrainian, Tatar, Jewish, and Belarusian.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\nThe best-known trees native to Novosibirsk are birch, pine, and aspen. Some mountain ash, hawthorn, spruce, and fir are also present. European species of apple, ash, elm, linden, and oak have been successfully introduced.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nThe city stands on the banks of the Ob River in the West Siberian Plain. To the south of the city lies the Priobskoye Plateau. The nearest major cities are Krasnoyarsk, Omsk and Nur-Sultan.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in Novosibirsk is typical of Siberia, with dry winters and far-below-freezing winter temperatures. The reason for these temperatures is the absence of a nearby ocean, the Ural Mountains barring Atlantic air masses from reaching Siberia, and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds. In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being \u00dcr\u00fcmqi in China.\nThe climate is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfb), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Novosibirsk is frequently cloudy in the winter due to the collision of Atlantic and Siberian air masses. Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from +15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) to +26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and in winter from \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) to \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F). However, winter temperatures can go as low as \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F) to \u221235 \u00b0C (\u221231 \u00b0F), and summer temperatures can go as high as +30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) to +35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The difference between the highest- and lowest-recorded temperatures is 82 \u00b0C (148 \u00b0F).\nTravellers coming from countries with mild climates may find Novosibirsk's winter tough, but it may not be extraordinary for those from northern countries. At times, bitter cold may hold for some days, but temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and lower do not occur every year.\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\nNovosibirsk is home to Russia's most powerful shortwave relay station east of the Ural mountains. This relay station can reach most of South Asia, the Middle East, and China. The Magadan and Vladivostok relay stations when operated in conjunction with Novosibirsk can guarantee that the Voice of Russia or any other broadcaster renting time at Novosibirsk is heard in the intended target area.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== International and intercity transportation ===\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n\nThe city is served by Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport.

There are also Novosibirsk-Zapadny (\"Zapadny\" means \"Western\"), Novosibirsk-Vostochny (\"Vostochny\" means \"Eastern\"), and Novosibirsk-Yuzhny (\"Yuzhny\" means \"Southern\") railway stations in Novosibirsk. All intercity trains passing through the aforementioned stations stop at these stations. In addition, there are halts where only suburban trains stops, for example Inskaya, Seyatel, Razyezd Inya, and many others.\nThe many regular intercity trains connect Novosibirsk with Russian cities in Siberia, the Far East, Ural, and European Russia. International trains allow to get to China, Mongolia, Belarus, and countries in Central Asia.\n\n\n==== Bus stations ====\nThe old Novosibirsk Bus Station located on Krasny Avenue in the right bank part of the city near Kommunalny Bridge was opened in 1964 and eventually closed on 6 April 2020. There is a plan to build some new bus stations on the periphery of the city; the first of these new bus stations was built on Gusinobrodskoe \u0421haussee and was opened on 18 December 2019.

          "Even if one is not travelling on the TransSib it makes sense to pay the building of the Main Railway Station of Novosibirsk a visit. By a big, not very attractive open space of concrete and asphalt is this elongated building kept in unusual turquoise and white colors. The single",
          "Novosibirsk railway station is an very nice building, beautiful architecture and you find basically everything you need for your long train ride either in the railway station or absolutely next by. We stocked up our food and drinks for the next part of our Vodka Train Adventure",
          "Big but usual railway station. Big square, small park nearly, it's just a hub, so does anybody is waiting something special from railway station? :)",
          "I have arrived into, I have purchased railway tickets at, and I have then departed from, the Novosibirsk Main Railway Station. I also lived in a flat that was very close to the Novosibirsk Main Railway Station. As a result, I know this railway station quite well and I also know",
          "We took the airport bus # 111 for 38 rubles, which runs directly to the train station. We had a short time to catch an overnight train to Omsk, and were able to store our luggage overnight at the \"left luggage\" area downstairs. It cost 200 ruble deposit i.e. one day, with the",
          "Cleanest and smartest railway station on our TSR trip so far (going east to west). Plenty of outlets for last minute needs",
          "Visually, the station is lovely. But if you plan using it, prepare to climb and carry your stuff around.",
          "Tsar's gold train organised a welcome singing and dancing at the station, which was nice. But nobody wanted to buy their CDs of course. They took some passengers to dance with them. They gave us welcome a huge piece of bread which you can pull out a bit and was really hard and",
          "I think this is the one of the place you should visit in Novosibirsk. We didn't go inside, but saw it from outside. And my friend told me that it is the Station building designed like train. Seemed like very special to me. I was going to there by Train from Ulan-Ude, thought",
          "If you visit Novosibirsk you most probably will see or even use this railway station. It is the hub for many to come to Novosibirsk and the outside appearance catches your eye with the cool teal green paint accenting the station. Even cooler at night!",
          "The station is huge, clean and has many small eating places and resting/waiting areas. I was daunted by its size and by the need to climb stairs to the platforms. Not an easy task with heavy luggage. I was overjoyed to find that they had porters, even a wheelchair for my friend",
          "Easy to find close to city centre. Not so big. Poor ventilation. Hard to find chairs for waiting. Easy to find right track. You don't have to be in so much time in advance.",
          "Really enjoyed a visit to Novosibirsk Railway Station as part of a Trans-Siberian trip. We were lucky enough to get an hour to spend in this delightful station full of hustle and bustle, lively market stalls, friendly locals and stunnning architecture. We went for a walk around",
          "There are two stations -- one for long distance and another for suburban trains. The main station is huge and somewhat confusing. Allow time to navigate the station.",
          "Stopped here on the trans Mongolian and drank a couple of beers on the platform, apparently a no no. Oh well.",
          "Impressive large but clean railway station, rumoured to be the largest in Russia. We arrived on the Golden Eagle Trans Siberian and spent about five hours touring the city. A local guide told us that the original station, and the birth of the Trans Siberian, is actually a",
          "I read that this was the largest railway station in Russia. I don't know. I saw a large railway station in Moscow. And a large one in St. Petersburg. But I didn't actually measure any of them, so I don't know.",
          "Clean railway station. A must stop for the Transiberian rail trip tourists. Pleasant architecture and clean toilets.",
          "I have not entered the building, but you may foresee a stop outside to take a nice shot of this nice architecture.",
          "Novosibirsk is the capital of Siberia and somewhere you are unlikely to get to unless you are en route to somewhere else. However, it was an interesting place to visit and the guide I had made what is quite an ordinary city seem quite extraordinary: it is the site of where the",
          "This railway station was beautiful, it was grand and had beautiful chandeliers. We are travelling on the Trans Siberian Rail, and found the railway very beautiful. Worth the stop.",
          "Went to see the train station even though we had flown to Novosibirsk. It was lovely for a train station.",
          "I stopped by here in October 2014 while on the Trans Siberian Railway, and the facilities in the Novosibirsk Railway station were great. Clean showers and toilets, as well as different shops to buy souvenirs and snacks. I'm glad that the train stopped for a while at this",
          "This is well worth a second look. In a city that is fairly drab and dull, this building stands out - it is well worth visiting - just off the main street through the City Centre.",
          "We hanged around trying to find information about our train and everything is in Russian and no staff member wiling to help us .Thank god we bought our tickets for the transsiberian in advance from home as we would still be there trying to communicate . With one exception staff",
          "Cute lime green buildings with little market in front on the square. It seems the smaller building is for domestic use and the larger one for more long distance travel. The decor inside is authentic and old fashioned. You need to walk trough an airport like scanning thing. My",
          "When you first see this station it is easy to assume that it is some sort of museum or palace, it is huge, when you enter there is marble everywhere and the whole place looks luxurious with large plants and trees in pots all over the place, there are many facilities and shops",
          "I'm a railway buff, and although I wasn't traveling by train, couldn't miss this station. The design is supposed to be reminiscent of an old locomotive. I couldn't see it. The station was smaller than I expected for its important location-- I think that it is the main rail hub",
          "The main station building in Novosibirsk resembles a locomotive - very clever architecture! The signs listing departing trains were all in Russian, but very clearly placed and laid out. There was a fast food shop inside station that advertised free wifi but I could not get it",
          "Historical station on the Transsiberian railway route. Not much to visit, merely a train station. But an interesting place to observe travelers getting ready for a long journey across Russia.",
          "Impressively large and clean station building with a nice looking and spacious cafe and waiting area.",
          "Had about one hour at the station as part of our Transiberian rail trip. Not a bad place to spend an hour. Appears recently renovated but still has that smell of communism. An archetypal piece of Russian architecture.",
          "I love this kind of station so nice its color green, with a larges halls . There is only one problem to carry on bagages because too many stairs.",
          "This looks like one of the modern buildings in Novosibirsk, was built in 1910 but since been renovated.park near by worth a walk round",
          "Very nice and charming Place... The colour is amazing! You can enter a lot of trains to other cities... I can recommend a Visit to the Main Station. No entry! You can arrive with the Metro! Greetings from Novosibirsk",
          "Handy location near he city center. Good transport hub with buses and subway/ metro nearby. Very busy in rush hours.",
          "It was my 3rd or 4th visit to Novosibirsk and I should say the Ralway Station has changed for the better since 2009 when I saw it last time. The halls are really clean and there are practically no queues at the ticket office, probably due to the unpopular season. The staff is",
          "Our Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian express group traveled in and out of the lovely green railway station when we spent half a day in Novosibirsk visiting some of the main sites. I see from the other reviewers that language barriers were a problem. Our guides thankfully were fluent",
          "It is not comfortable to travellers carring big bagages on too many stairs. Elevators are needed.",
          "The building is nice and recently refurbished, but the service has a lot to do in order to improve and become friendly for foreigners. If you do not have the support of a Russian-English speaker you are lost. The lady at the information desk speaks only Russian. I tryed with",
          "You could not see a better example of Soviet architecture than this great station. Recently redecorated in the traditional blue. The waiting room is magnificent with polished wood, crystal lamps and all the nostalgia of the Soviet Union. The metro is adjacent to the station",
          "A impressive, imposing soviet style railway station. Clean, functional, good signage. Taxis available outside, even a porter service",
          "That's very nice inside and outside. Information displays are proper. All necessery services are there. Hey, the toilets are PAID!!!!!............ So, guys, when you are about to pee into your pents you still should to find the required change to pay first))) And then the toilet",
          "Soviet era decor has not aged well in the main building, and you never know whether the smell is coming from the toilets or the homeless on the floor.",
          "It's old and it's very USSR. I've benn there in early morning, day and night time - it's not very friendly, a bit dirty, but still interesting to see.",
          "If you can speak the language, the employees are very helpful and kind. If not - DON't come! the station is clean and convenient to travel.",
          "We took trains from Moscow to Nizhney Novogorod to Yekaterinburg and finally to Novosibirsk. The last station in Siberia--Novosibirsk--was welcomed and huge. The architecture is very Russian, all being of immense proprortions. The building is brightly painted on the outside",
          "Down below in the luggage store they are not very friendly and check the times! also the choice of food items are not very big here.",
          "The location! Please research where you need to be and chances are you can almost walk there instead of the hassle of getting and overpaying for a taxi.",
          "Novosibirsk Main Railway Station was rather recently remodeled, and now it looks very nice. Inside the building it is normally is very crowded, as it is very important transport hub -- Turksib, railway coming from the south, here joins with Transsib, TransSiberian Railway. In",
          "I can't imagine someone going let's say from London to see Heathrow, so generally transportation facilities are not considered to be attractions, but this is a special case. Novosibirsk was born with the railway and it was always playing important role in the life of the city.",
          "Big and comfortable station. A lot of services are paid. Twice there were conerts of young musicians from Novosibirsk Conservatory. It was great!",
          "Kids were happy to go there and visit old trains. We enjoyed!",
          "A very nice spatious building designed in a form of a railway locomotive. Third best city attraction (after the Zoo and Opera and Ballet Theater). Very comfortable and pretty inside. Recently renovated, expanded and very well kept",
          "its not just ^a station\" another building worth seeing for its architecture ..ground level platforms so you have to climb up to board,.....just outside i recomend a glass of kwos (PROBABLY SPELT WRONG!) ..a drink made from black bread"

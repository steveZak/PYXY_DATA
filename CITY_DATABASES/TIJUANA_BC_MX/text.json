        "wiki": "Tijuana (US:  tee-(H)WAH-n\u0259, Spanish: [ti\u02c8xwana] (listen)) is the largest city of both Baja California State and the Baja California Peninsula. It is part of the San Diego\u2013Tijuana transborder urban agglomeration and the larger Southern California megalopolis. As the 6th-largest city in Mexico and center of the 6th-largest metro area in Mexico, Tijuana exerts a strong influence in education and politics \u2013 across Mexico, in transportation, culture and art \u2013  across all three Californias (the U.S. state of California, Baja California and Baja California Sur), and in manufacturing and as a migration hub \u2013 across the North American continent. Currently one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in Mexico, Tijuana maintains GaWC 'sufficiency city' status. As of 2015, the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,641,570.Tijuana is located on the Pacific coast of Baja California, and is the municipal seat and the cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality (Mexican states are divided into municipalities, rather than counties as in the U.S.). Tijuana covers 70% of the territory of the municipality and contains 80% of its population. A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent, the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies. In the early 21st century,  Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America. Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca. The city is the most visited border city in the world; sharing a border of about 24 km (15 mi) with its sister city San Diego. More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year. This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the fourth busiest land-border crossing in the world. It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone.Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico.  According to the 2015 census, the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico, with a population of 1,840,710, but rankings vary, the city (locality) itself was 6th largest and the municipality (administrative) 3rd largest nationally.  The international metropolitan region was estimated at about 5,158,459 in 2016, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region, 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas, and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico.  Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego.\nTijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias. As the American occupation of the Mexican capital ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Tijuana's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure. The city was founded on July 11, 1889 as urban development began. Often known by its supposed initials, T.J., and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico, the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe city's name comes from the rancho that Santiago Arg\u00fcello Moraga established in 1829 on his Mexican land grant, naming it Rancho T\u00eda Juana.The first Spanish mission call the settlement variously as La T\u00eda Juana, Tiguana, Tiuana, Tiwana, Tijuan, Ticuan, as well as Tijuana. While the Mexican city standardized to Tijuana, the American term for both the river and a U.S. settlement which is now part of San Ysidro remained T\u00eda Juana until the mid-20th century.\nThe commonly accepted theory among historians is that T\u00eda Juana, as Arg\u00fcello named his rancho, is derived from the word Tiwan (\"by the sea\") in the language of the Kumeyaay\u2014the original aboriginal inhabitants of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Urban legend, however, states that T\u00eda Juana, which means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, was a real person whose inn provided food and lodging to travelers. There is however no record of such an inn; in fact the first building in the area was built by Arg\u00fcello in any case, after naming his ranch Rancho T\u00eda Juana.\n\n\n=== Nicknames ===\nIn Southern California, Tijuana is often referred to as TJ or T.J. Baja Californians have adopted this pronunciation as Tiyei. In Spanish the demonym for someone from Tijuana is Tijuanense, while in English the demonym is Tijuanan. A very common slang term used for a person from Tijuana is Tijuanero.The nickname Tijuas is increasingly popular among residents and visitors alike. Due to a recent increase in violence in the city, a new term is developing. The phrase Yo Tijuaneo, \u00bfy t\u00fa? translates to I Tijuanate, and you?. This term comes from a new popular local verb Tijuanear meaning to Tijuana, describing the cosmopolitan aspects of living in the city and frequently crossing the border.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe land was originally inhabited by the Kumeyaay, a tribe of Yuman-speaking hunter-gatherers. Europeans arrived in 1542, when the explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo toured the coastline of the area, which Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno mapped in 1602. In 1769, Juan Cresp\u00ed documented more details about the area that was later called the Valley of Tijuana. Jun\u00edpero Serra founded the first mission of Alta California in nearby San Diego.\nFurther settlement took place near the end of the mission era when Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda, governor of the Baja California and Alta California, awarded a large land grant to Santiago Arg\u00fcello in 1829. This large cattle ranch, Rancho T\u00eda Juana, covered 100 km2 (40 sq mi). Although \"Tia Juana\" means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, the name was actually an adaptation of the word 'Tihuan' or 'Tiju\u00e1n' in the Kumeyaay language, the name of a nearby Kumeyaay settlement and whose meaning is disputed.In 1848, as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War with the United States, Mexico lost all of Alta California. The majority of the 1,000 Hispanic families living in Alta California stayed there, though some moved south to remain inside Mexico. Because of this Tijuana gained a different purpose on the international border. The area had been populated by ranchers, but Tijuana developed a new social economic structure. These were farming and livestock grazing, plus as a transit area for prospectors.\n\n\n=== 1889\u20131915: Town established ===\nUrban settlement began in 1889, when descendants of Santiago Arg\u00fcello and August\u00edn Olvera entered an agreement to begin developing the city of Tijuana. The date of the agreement, July 11, 1889, is recognized as the founding of the city. Tijuana saw its future in tourism from the beginning. From the late 19th century to the first few decades of the 20th century, the city attracted large numbers of Californians coming for trade and entertainment. The California land boom of the 1880s led to the first big wave of tourists, who were called \"excursionists\" and came looking for echoes of the famous novel \"Ramona\" by Helen Hunt Jackson.\nIn 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, revolutionaries claiming loyalty to Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n took over the city for shortly over a month. Federal troops then arrived. Assisted by the \"defensores de Tijuana\", they routed the revolutionaries, who fled north and were promptly arrested by the United States Army.\nThe Panama-California Exposition of 1915 brought many visitors to the nearby California city of San Diego. Tijuana attracted these tourists with a Feria T\u00edpica Mexicana \u2013 Typical Mexican Fair. This included curio shops, regional food, thermal baths, horse racing and boxing.\n\n\n=== 1916\u20131935: Gambling and drinking destination ===\nThe first professional race track opened in January 1916, just south of the border gate. It was almost immediately destroyed by the great \"Hatfield rainmaker\" flood of 1916. Rebuilt in the general area, it ran horse races until the new Agua Caliente track opened in 1929, several miles south and across the river on higher ground.\nLegal drinking and gambling attracted U.S nationals in the 1920s during Prohibition. The Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area became the city's tourist center, with casinos and the Hotel Caesar's, birthplace of the Caesar salad.\nIn 1925, the city by presidential decree changed his name to   ciudad Zaragoza, but its name reverted to Tijuana in 1929.\nIn 1928, the Agua Caliente Touristic Complex was opened, including hotel, spa, dog-track, private airport, golf course and gambling casino. A year later, the new Agua Caliente Racetrack joined the complex. During the eight years it operated, the Agua Caliente hotel, casino and spa achieved a near mythical status, with Hollywood stars and gangsters flying in and playing. Rita Hayworth was discovered there. Musical nightclub productions were broadcast over the radio. A singer known as \"la Faraona\" got shot in a love-triangle and gave birth to the myth of a beautiful lady ghost. Remnants of the Agua Caliente casino can be seen in the outdoor swimming pool and the \"minarete\" (actually a former incinerator chimney) nearby the southern end of Avenida Sanchez Taboada, on the grounds of what is now the Lazaro Cardenas educational complex.\n\n\n=== 1935\u20131965: Tourism broadens ===\nIn 1935, President C\u00e1rdenas decreed an end to gambling and casinos in Baja California, and the Agua Caliente complex faltered, then closed. In 1939, it was reopened as a junior high school (now, Preparatoria L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas). The buildings themselves were torn down in the 1970s and replaced by modern scholastic architecture.\nWith increased tourism and a large number of Mexican citizens relocating to Tijuana, the city's population grew from 21,971 to 65,364 between 1940 and 1950.\n\nWith the decline of nightlife and tourism in the 1950s, the city restructured its tourist industry, by promoting a more family-oriented scene. Tijuana developed a greater variety of attractions and activities to offer its visitors.\n\n\n=== 1965\u20132001: The city matures ===\nIn 1965 the Mexican federal government launched the Border Industrialization Program to attract foreign investment. Tijuana and other border cities became attractive for foreign companies to open maquiladoras (factories), and the Tijuana economy started to diversify. Manufacturing jobs attracted workers from other parts of Mexico and the city's population grew from less than half a million in 1980 to almost 1 million in 1985.\nIn 1972, work began on the first concrete channeling of the Tijuana River; previously the river would flood across a wide plain east and southeast of downtown, inundating an area of wood, cardboard and metal shacks called Cartolandia (\u201cPaperland\u201d).  The project removed the shacks and added 1.8 million sq. m. of usable land, on which the Zona R\u00edo was built. With the 1981 opening of the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana mall and the 1982 Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT), Zona R\u00edo became the new commercial center of a modern Tijuana, and with its new boulevards with monument-filled glorietas (roundabouts), reminiscent of the grand Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, the city created the new image and allure of a modern, large city, rather than just a border town focused on tourism and vice.In 1994, PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana while making an appearance in the plaza of Lomas Taurinas, a neighborhood nestled in a valley near Centro. The shooter was caught and imprisoned, but doubts remain about who the mastermind might have been.\n\n\n=== 2001\u20132011: Violence and decline of US tourism ===\nAfter 9/11, tighter US border controls resulted in hours-long waits to return to the US. The number of US visitors dropped sharply due to this factor, as well as subsequent drug violence.Around 2008, thousands of Tijuana's elite bought houses in and moved to Bonita and Eastlake in Chula Vista, California to escape violence, kidnapping and other crimes taking place during that period. An article in The Los Angeles Times reported that the emigration to San Diego County has transformed the demographic and cultural character of some cities to a degree.\n\n\n=== 2011\u2013present: Tijuana strengthens ===\nIn recent years, Tijuana has become an important city of commerce and migration for Mexico and US. In spite of the violence and border crossing issues, the city has received a large number of tourists from US, China, Japan and the south of Mexico. Thanks to the realization of cultural and business festivals, the city has improved its image before the world, standing out as a competitive city for investment. Currently, the commercial and business sector is committed to the boom in the gastronomic industry, craft beer, entertainment and real estate, as well as medical tourism, to attract visitors and investors.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTijuana is the westernmost city in Mexico, and consequently in Latin America, and the second largest city of northern Mexico. Located about 210 kilometers (130 mi) west of the state capital, Mexicali, the city is bordered to the north by the cities of Imperial Beach, and the San Diego neighborhoods of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, California. To the southwest of the city is Rosarito Beach, while to the south is unincorporated territory of Tijuana Municipality. The city is nestled among hills, canyons, and gullies. The central part of the city lies in a valley through which flows the channeled Tijuana River.\nHousing development in the Tijuana Hills has led to eradication of many seasonal mountain streams. This lack of natural drainage makes places within the city vulnerable to landslides during the rainy season. The varied terrain of Tijuana gives the city elevation extremes that range from sea level to 790 meters (2,590 ft).\nTijuana is noted for its rough terrain, which includes many canyons, steep hills, and mesas. Among noted canyons in Tijuana are Canyon K and Canyon Johnson. Large Tijuana hills include Red Hill (Cerro Colorado) and Hill of the Bees (Cerro de las Abejas) in the eastern part of the city.\nThe city is located near the terminus of the Tijuana River and within the Tijuana River Basin. The Tijuana River is an intermittent river, 195 km (121 mi) long, on the Pacific coast of northern Baja California in Mexico and Southern California in the United States. It drains an arid area along the California\u2013Baja California border, flowing through Mexico for most of its course and then crossing the border for the last 8 km (5 mi) of its course where it forms an estuary that empties into the ocean. The river's lower reaches harbor the last undeveloped coastal wetlands in San Diego County, and some of the last in Southern California, amidst a highly urbanized environment at the southern city limits of Imperial Beach.\nAs downtown Tijuana was built at the bottom of the river valley, the district is subject to seasonal flooding created by drain-off from the Tijuana Hills. During this time, east-bound portions of the Via Rapida (east-west highway) may be blocked off by the Tijuana Police due to hazardous conditions.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city's skyscraper history is relatively recent. Some of the first highrise building complexes constructed in the city were the twin towers of Grand Hotel Tijuana. Tijuana experienced a building boom that was brought to a halt by the Great Recession. Among buildings that succumbed to the time period was the Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico that would have been located in Playas and reached 98 m (322 ft). Currently the tallest building, and soon to be the largest complex in footage, New City Residential reaches 102 m (335 ft). Overall, the city maintains 33 completed structures with other proposed and under-construction skyscrapers.\n\nThe Tijuana skyline is the fifth largest skyline in Mexico and is located in the Zona Rio and to a smaller extent, Playas de Tijuana. In the Zona Rio the buildings are concentrated on the Tijuana River, lined parallel to the river; and on the edges of the Tijuana Country Club. In Playas the high rises are currently focused on the coast. Recent construction on high rises has begun in the aforementioned areas, as buildings such as New City Residential and Grand Hotel Tijuana have been developed and taken prominent places in the skyline as the tallest buildings. From Tijuana's skyline the San Diego skyline can also be seen, although the reverse is mostly not true on account of the high hills surrounding central Tijuana.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Tijuana is divided into eight administrative boroughs, or Delegaciones. The Tijuana metropolitan area occupies all of borough seats. The boroughs are in turn divided into colonias or ejidos. These boroughs offer administrative services such as urban planning, civil registry, inspection, verification, public works and community development and are served by a delegado.\n\nCentro \u2014 \"Delegaci\u00f3n Centro\" includes the old downtown (Zona Centro), new business district (Zona R\u00edo), red light district (Zona Norte), and other adjacent neighborhoods (\"zonas\"). This is the historical midpoint of Tijuana; the municipal palace is located here as well as most of the tourist zones, such as Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n and the business district. The Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT for CEntro CUltural de Tijuana) is located here as well as the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana, until recently the largest mall in the state, within the Zona Rio.\nCerro Colorado \u2014 The Cerro Colorado (\"Red Hill\") is located here and it is surrounded by houses. Because of its height many of the area's antennae for radio and television stations are located on its peak.\nLa Mesa \u2014 This is where the Morelos Park, the largest public park in the city, is located, as well as the retail and transit hub Cinco y Diez, Plaza Mundo Divertido, the new Macroplaza and the CETYS University.\nOtay Centenario \u2014 This borough was created in 2014 by merging Mesa de Otay and Centenario boroughs. In this borough sits the Tijuana International Airport.  The Tijuana campus of the Autonomous University of Baja California and the Technologico are also located here as well as many maquiladoras. This is the borough with the largest number of factories and maquiladoras. Its largest colony is Ciudad Industrial (\"Industrial City\"). Three of the city's most important streets, Boulevard Bellas Artes, Boulevard Industrial and Fed 2, are located here.  This delegacion contains the Otay Mesa entry to the United States and the Friendship Park (Parque de la amistad).\nPlayas de Tijuana \u2014 This is the westernmost borough of the city bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the United States border on the north. This is where the beaches of Tijuana are located (hence the name) and it is also one of the two exits to the south towards Rosarito and Ensenada.\nLa Presa \u2014 literally \"'the dam'\", this is the largest borough in size and the Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez Dam is located within its limits, hence its name. The new Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 and the Tijuana-Tecate freeways run through it.\nSan Antonio de los Buenos \u2014 This is mostly a residential area although it also has two industrial parks.\nSanchez Taboada \u2014 Like the previous borough this is mostly a residential area, but within its borders are located many \"maquiladoras\" specially at Pacific Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTijuana's climate is a semi-arid (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh), with about 231 mm (9.09 in) of annual precipitation, and generally mild to warm weather year-round. It has characteristics of the Mediterranean climate (Csa) found to the immediate north, with most of the annual precipitation falling in the winter, between the months of November and March.\n\nBetween November and March, storms originate from fronts entering off of the Pacific Ocean. January is the wettest month of the year for the city and during this time a periodic event, similar to June Gloom, is observed created by marine layer. January is the coolest month, during which temperatures average 13.6 \u00b0C (56.5 \u00b0F). In the city April signifies the end of winter and the start of Santa Ana winds. Though the daytime highs are generally around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), heat waves can reach up to 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F). The hottest months in the city are August and September, during which temperatures average 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Summers are by far the driest time of year since influences from the California Current and the North Pacific High suppress the formation of rainfall caused by the North American Monsoon. As in coastal Southern California, air pollution sometimes occurs during periods of temperature inversion, especially during summer and fall, but (unlike Mexico City) is seldom severe and in recent years has lessened due to cleaner car engines.Frost and snow are rare phenomena in the city as temperatures are usually well above freezing. Yet, in December 1967, snow fell in the city and in January 2007 feather light snow fell in the east of the city. However, excessive amounts of snow fall have never been recorded in the city. On February 14, 2008 a winter storm caused an unusual snowfall in the upper reaches of the hills of the city.\nThe record low temperature recorded in the city was \u22126 \u00b0C (21 \u00b0F), while the highest was 49 \u00b0C (120 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nTijuana has a diverse cosmopolitan population which includes migrants from other parts of Mexico and from all over the world. Tijuana has one of Mexico's largest Asian populations, predominantly consisting of Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese immigrants. Tijuana also has a large and rapidly growing population of United States citizens, mostly from Southern California.  Many Latin Americans, notably Cubans, and Guatemalans, have made Tijuana their home. The city also has many Lebanese, Italian, French, Spanish citizens. Recently, the city has received a large influx of Haitian immigrants.\n\nThe majority of Tijuana's migrant Mexican population hail from Sinaloa, Michoac\u00e1n, Jalisco, Oaxaca, and the Federal District. Because of the diversity of Mexico and the influx of immigrants from almost every region in the country, there are no accurate estimates on ethnicity or race of the current population. The heavy influx of immigrants to the city and municipality of Tijuana has led to job creation in the form of over 700 twin-plant (maquiladora) factories, which serve as the basis of employment for the majority of the working-class people in northern Mexico.  The high poverty level in Tijuana is attributed to the city's \"magnet status\" for people who have come from the poorer south of the nation and citizens from other nations seeking to escape from extreme poverty.  Tijuana holds a status that provides the possibility of employment as well as higher education and the dream of crossing the border.  Tijuana and Baja California in general have much stronger economies and higher incomes than other Mexican cities along the United States border, as well as more moderate weather.\nTijuana today is one of the fastest growing cities in Mexico with an average of 80,000 people moving to Tijuana yearly.  In terms of area, the city grows by approximately three hectares a day, mostly east and south as the city is mostly built out to the beach already with the exception of some canyons.  Along with settlements separated from Tijuana proper and other communities unimproved land, big business moves in providing supermarkets and retail to marginal areas, along with paved roads.  The city experiences the construction of 26,000 new settlers a year that has led to the unregulated, illegal squatter homes that takes place in the hills and valleys of ever expanding Tijuana, most of these areas are still without city services like sidewalks, paving, streetlights, and public transit. This is an ongoing process: as older and existing squatter areas are brought into the city services, more marginal areas become occupied by squatters.\nSquatter areas are home to displaced and uprooted people, among them the indigenous and poverty stricken, as well as migrants deported from the USA, many of whom are also without Mexican citizenship.  In recent years, working-class suburban housing estates have sprung up in the fringes to provide a sense of safety and land ownership.  These suburbs enable young families to isolate their families from the violence of the drug war and squatter areas.  These outlying communities tend to be much better equipped than their squatter counterparts.  Nevertheless, some remote areas are drug plantations for narcotics, and delinquency has spread to areas once considered safe havens.  These issues occasionally come to light in the newspapers.\nNational Population Council (CONAPO) data has estimated that by 2030, growth rates maintaining, the city will become the second largest in Mexico and anchor to the fourth largest metropolitan area in Mexico. The suburban sprawl observed in Tijuana leaves the downtown and beach areas relatively affluent.\n\nWhile the INEGI Census 2010 placed Tijuana's population at 1.3 million, only two percent more than in 2005 Census, Tijuana City Council estimates from 2010 place the population closer to two million, at 1.6 million. As funding for cities is based on the populace of the city, the Council worries about receiving adequate funds to provide for the needs of the city.  The population discrepancies may be explained by a few factors.  Shanty towns that have not been rasterized and an undercount, people having left Tijuana for United States, and people leaving Tijuana for the interior of Mexico due to the intensification of the drug war, and suburbanization outside city limits but still inside the municipality.  Tijuana, because of the dreams of border crossers, and its relatively higher wages compared to the rest of Mexico, naturally attracts immigrants.  Since an improvement in security since 2011, the population of Tijuana as reflected in the 2015 Mexican census is expected to return to its normal growth curve; the great reduction in violence should make the settlement of Tijuana an attractive option again versus fringe valleys, nevertheless exact figures from the census await.\nAccording to the Second Census of Population and Housing of the year 2010 conducted by the INEGI (National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics) the municipality of Tijuana has 1,559,683 inhabitants within 879 km2, the city or settlement of Tijuana only covers \u2154 of that area.  While the metropolitan area of Tijuana (1392 km2), composed of Tijuana Municipality and Rosarito Beach Municipality, has 1,751,302 inhabitants. Tecate Municipality, adjacent to Tijuana Municipality, has not yet been considered by the government as part of the metropolitan area.  However, there is great economic and cultural exchange between the cities regions though there are still expanses of rural land. As Tijuana grows, many of its suburbs have been built increasingly inland, and in the direction of Tecate; Valley of the Palms is a large planned city between the two.\nAs of 2005 the large majority of the city's population, 96%, adhere to the beliefs of Christianity. The denominations are further divided into followers of Catholicism \u2013 61% \u2013 and of Protestantism \u2013 35%.  While other beliefs occupying a 4% margin in the city include Taoism (among other Asian and European religions), atheism and agnosticism is also found.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nTijuana is the birthplace and base of the Tijuana Cartel.  From 2007 through 2010, Tijuana experienced an unusually high level of violent crime related to gang violence, in part derived from the Mexican drug war and human trafficking.  Homicides peaked in 2010, when 844 people were killed, compared with 355 in 2004 and 349 in the first eight months of 2011. Reportedly, the wave of violence resulted from a turf war as the administration of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n weakened the local Arellano F\u00e9lix cartel; violence slowed when the larger Sinaloa cartel took control.During peak years of violent crime in the city, gun battles between rival cartels, and between cartels and the police, erupted in public. In April 2008, police found 1,500 shell casings on various streets after one battle left 13 suspected drug traffickers dead. In 2009 and depending on the source, Tijuana Municipality experienced either 556 or 1,118 murders, mostly as a result of the drug war.There were 492 murders in 2013, a 48% increase in the homicide rate between 2012 and 2013. This was the highest number of murders since 2010. By the end of 2017, the number of murders in Tijuana increased to 1,744, which was almost double those in 2016.As of 2018, Tijuana had the highest per capita rate for homicides in the world at 138 murders per 100,000 people.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Region ===\n\nAt present the parties with greater presence in Tijuana are the National Action Party (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). The PAN has been the dominant party in the city for 20 years. Historically the PRI had been the dominant party in regional politics, until 1989 when the PAN began to dominate the city, until yet again, in 2004, PRI began regaining prominence and won the Mayor's Office.\nLess prominent parties also maintain relations with the dominant parties. These other parties, with less presence include the New Alliance Party (PANAL), Social Encounter Party (PES), and Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Allied with the PAN at the state and local level under the Alliance for Baja California are the Social Encounter Party (PES) and New Alliance Party (PANAL). Allied with the PRI at the state and local level under the \"Alliance for Better Living\" are the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) and Baja California State Party (PEBC).\n\n\n=== International ===\nTijuana's importance and rise to a global city has led to its recognition among countries worldwide. In addition to international cultural recognition, Tijuana has received political recognition and is a developing a political center currently host to eight consulates from European, Asian, and North American countries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\n\nTijuana is a large manufacturing center, and in addition to tourism, it serves as a cornerstone of the city economy. In the past decade alone, Tijuana became the medical device manufacture capital of the North American continent, surpassing previous leader Minneapolis - Saint Paul.The city's proximity to Southern California and its large, skilled, diverse, and relatively inexpensive workforce make it an attractive city for foreign companies looking to establish extensive industrial parks composed of assembly plants that are called maquiladoras, even more so than other cities in the US-Mexican border zone, taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to export products. At its peak, in 2001 Tijuana had roughly 820 of these 'maquiladoras'. Foreign and domestic companies employ thousands of employees in these plants, usually in assembly-related labor. Such jobs are not demanding but typically offer above average salaries for Mexico, with most maqiladoras jobs beginning at Mex$100 per day (about 5 US dollars, as of September 2016), significantly above the Mexican minimum wage of Mex$57.46 (about 3 US dollars, as of September 2016). Companies that have set up maquiladoras in Tijuana include Lanix, Hyundai, Sony, Vortec, BMW, Vizio, Toyota, Dell, Samsung, Kodak, Matsushita/Panasonic, GE, Nabisco, Ford, Microsoft, Cemex, Zonda, Philips, Pioneer, Airbus, Plantronics, Siemens Mexico, Jaguar, Pall Medical, Tara, Sanyo and Volkswagen. Many of the maquiladoras are located in the Otay Mesa and Florido sections of Tijuana.\nEconomic development has its central business district at Zona R\u00edo, which together, with the corridor along Blvd. Agua Caliente (the extension of Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n), contains the majority of the higher-end office space in the city.\n\n\n=== Tourist economy and entertainment ===\nTijuana also relies on tourism for a major part of its revenue. About 300,000 visitors cross by foot or car from the San Ysidro point of entry in the United States every day. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs, and shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are part of the draw for the city's tourists, many located within walking distance of the border. The city's tourist centers include Downtown Tijuana including the nightlife hot spots around La Sexta, Avenida Revolucion, souvenir shopping at the Mercado de Artesan\u00edas and Plaza Viva Tijuana, Tijuana's Cultural Center (CECUT) and neighboring Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana shopping center, and the city's best known vices, in the form of its legal Red Light District and gambling (Agua Caliente). Mexico's drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college aged Southern Californians who tend to stay on Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n.\nTijuana is also known for its red-light district Zona Norte (also referred to as La Coahuila after one of its main streets) with legal prostitution in strip clubs and on the street. The strip clubs are typically full-contact, meaning the dancers let patrons fondle them. Many dancers also sell their sexual services. In a 1999 estimation, there were 15,000 women engaged in prostitution in Tijuana outside of clubs and brothels.Tijuana has many pharmacies that target visitors from the United States, which sell some medicines without prescriptions and/or at much lower costs than in the U.S. Many medications still require a Mexican prescription, which can be obtained from adjacent doctors' offices. People filling up prescriptions for drugs classified in the US as Schedule II or Schedule III have found it more difficult to locate such medications, and the purchase of pseudoephedrine also has become restricted by Tijuana pharmacies, just as in the U.S. To fill a prescription in Tijuana for any drug covered by the US Controlled Substances Act  and legally bring it into the United States requires a prescription from the United States for re-import.  Americans can import up to a 90-day supply of non-controlled medications for personal use to the USA from Mexico and other countries.\nBusinesses such as auto detailing, medical and dental services and plastic surgery are heavily marketed, and are usually much less expensive than in the U.S.\nTijuana is headquarters for Mexico's largest gambling concern, Grupo Caliente, which operates the only casinos in the city, more than twenty branches.Tourists are sometimes robbed by municipal police.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nPlaza Rio Tijuana is a large regional mall anchored by Cin\u00e9polis, Sanborns, S\u00faper DAX and Sears.\nAll across the city, there are dozens of plazas comerciales, which may be strip malls or small enclosed or open-air centers, with a combination of any or all of the following anchors:\n\none of the 26 Tijuana branches of the small department store Coppel,\na supermarket or hypermarket,\na cin\u00e9polis or cinemex multicinema,\na branch of the electronics and motorcycle retailer ElektraAn important concentration of plazas is in the Cinco y Diez around an eponymous intersection, named for a former American-style five and dime store that was located there. It is also a major hub for public transit. Plaza Carrousel, with its namesake merry-go-round, is located here.\nCostco, Sam's Club, and Walmart each have multiple branches across the city.\nTraditional markets with vendors include the large Mercado Hidalgo in Zona R\u00edo, smaller neighborhood markets and the Mercado Municipal downtown.\nTijuana was the headquarters of 14-store Dorian's department store chain until its demise in 2009; most were converted to Sears stores.\n\n\n=== Culinary ===\nTijuana, along with the nearby Valle de Guadalupe, has recently become a culinary hotspot due to its Baja Med cuisine, including chefs such as Javier Plascencia, but also for its tacos, other street food, food trucks, coffee houses and artisanal beer.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTijuana is home to many private Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and High Schools as well as nationally high ranked colleges and universities. Notable primary and secondary schools include Metropolitan, Instituto M\u00e9xico, Instituto Cumbres, President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas School, Agua Caliente School Center High, Polit\u00e9cnico de Baja California(CLUB DE QU\u00cdMICA), Jos\u00e9 Fimbres Moreno School and the State High School, and Ignacio Ram\u00edrez School located in Cerro Colorado. These schools maintain recognition for their demands and high standards.\nTijuana maintains multiple higher education institutions. These include the Autonomous University of Baja California, Tijuana (UABC), Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Tijuana (ITT), Universidad Iberoamericana (UIA-Tijuana), CETYS Universidad, Universidad Xochicalco, and University of the Californias. Other colleges include Tijuana University Center, Tijuana University of Technology, Graduate Center of the Northwest, and the University of Professional Development. The city is the seat of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), an institution of scientific research and higher education, specializing in the study of the problems in the border region between Mexico and the United States. In August 2009, Metropolitan UABC opened in Valle de Las Palmas, in the Tijuana metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Culture and contemporary life ==\nMany foreigners travel to Tijuana to drink and dance, buy prescription drugs, purchase bootleg brand-name clothing, timepieces, and other personal accessories found globally, as well as manufactured and hand-crafted local curiosities. Locals and regular tourists avoid hassles by visiting the clubs at Plaza Fiesta or other areas of the Zona R\u00edo without the crowds, heavy marketing, and occasional tourist misbehavior or outright lawbreaking common on the Revoluci\u00f3n strip. However, Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n has been known for its proliferation of nightclub shows, primarily catering to casual tourists. While still an entertaining town with an enjoyable atmosphere, some locals and tourists feel it has lost an \"anything goes\" atmosphere, that was dangerous to locals, tourists, and the tourism industry.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nAs Tijuana matured from a tourist-oriented border town into one of Mexico's largest cities, the 1982 opening of the Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT) marked a milestone. CECUT's mission was to strengthening Tijuana's image, both to US visitors and to Mexicans, as a destination for culture and not only shopping and vice. The center includes an OMNIMAX cinema showing IMAX films, the Museum of the Californias, contemporary art exhibition halls, a restaurant, caf\u00e9, bookstore,  and other cultural facilities.\nLa Casa de la Cultura cultural center comprises a school, a theater, and a public library, and teaches dance, painting, music, plastic arts, photography and languages.\nOther cultural venues include the Instituto Municipal de Arte y Cultura (Municipal Institute of Art and Culture), the Tijuana Wax Museum, the Museo El Trompo (Trompo Museum), and El Foro, the former Jai Alai Palace, that is now a concert venue. Concerts are also held at the Estadio Caliente stadium, Hip\u00f3dromo Agua Caliente Racetrack, and at the \"Audiorama\" at the Museo El Trompo children's museum of science and technology.The Tijuana Country Club (Club Campestre de Tijuana) has many affluent members and a famous golf course and also functions as an entertainment and events venue. Tijuana also has a large Rotary Club.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\nParque Morelos has a small zoo and park space; Parque de la Amistad in Otay Centenario has a small pond, and a running and dirt-bike track. Parque Teniente Guerrero is a downtown park with a public library and weekend entertainment by clowns.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nTijuana's nightlife scene is one of the city's strongest attractions. The area surrounding \"La Sexta\", the intersection at Calle Sexta and Av. Revoluci\u00f3n, is now a major hub of new bars and dance clubs. Zona Rio, Tijuana's new Downtown, is home to some of the city's finest restaurants and bars. Another capstone of Tijuana's entertainment offerings is its adult nightlife industry, which includes the city's red light district as well as less conspicuous adult entertainment venues.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nTijuana also has a very active and independent artist community whose internationally recognized work has earned Tijuana the title of \"one of the most important new cultural meccas\", according to Newsweek, an exhibition of Tijuana's current art scene, is being curated by the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and is traveling across the USA in 2006 and 2007. Art collectives like Bulbo and film production like Palenque Filmaciones explore the use of film like the award-winning Tijuana Makes Me Happy, media like television bulbo TV and print \"bulbo PRESS\", to show different realities of Tijuana out of Mexico. In 2004, Tijuana earned international acclaim for an art exhibition displayed on the cement banks of the Tijuana River and along the Mexico/U.S. border fence in Otay Mesa.\nGraffiti is widespread in Tijuana. They can range from free-hand writing in spray can and marker form, often carrying social or sexual commentary in English or Spanish, pictures in wheatpaste and stencils, consisting of stenciled renderings of personalities crucial to Hispanic culture from past and present eras, such as television news announcers or stars, but also extending to images of artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed. Graffiti in Tijuana may seem at first to consist largely of simplistic tags and thus not as technically evolved, colorful, or accepted in the mainstream as the \"pieces\" of graffiti scenes of the United States, Europe, or Japan, but large, colorful graffiti murals adorn walls from both native Tijuanan artists as well as visiting graffiti writers, especially from California. The Tijuanan art pieces show as much prowess and skill as those made by their more renowned U.S. counterparts, although illicit graffiti are strongly discouraged by the Tijuana government, as in other major metropolitan areas.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nSince the decade of the 1920s, Tijuana has excelled in the musical field, thanks to the first groups of ranchera music that began to set the tourist establishments in the area with the visit of foreigners, including the former Casino Agua Caliente.\nRock music was very popular and popular among young people in the mid-50s, leaving the ranch rhythm aside years ago. Another event that added the arrival of Rock to Tijuana was the visit of the African-American pianist and guitarist, Gene Ross, who came to play at the Convoy Club on Revolution Avenue. The presence of this artist was the beginning of the rock scene in the region that marked a new style in the country.54 Some groupings of the nascent Mexican rock began, an example of which was \"The Tijuana Five\", who made some covers in Spanish of Anglo-Saxon successes.\nJavier Batiz founded in 1957 he founded a group called \"Los TJ's\" with which he collected musical influences that were received in the Mexican border cities of black music, blues and R&B from people like T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin 'Wolf, James Brown, among others. Later he would start his solo career in the rest of the country and participating in some bands in Mexico City.\nDuring the 60s, the American trumpeter Herb Alpert, in a visit to the bullfights made in the old Bullfight, found musical inspiration so after the recording of his single \"The Lonely Bull\", which was a radio hit in 1962. With the success, he decided to make a casting and formed \"The Tijuana Brass\", with whom he toured and had a presentation on television. It was a musical collaboration with artists from Los Angeles, with style called \"Tijuana Marimba\u00b4s Brass\". The band was dissolved in 1969 but they continued with some presentations under the name of T.J.B. 55\nAt the end of the 60s and during the 70s, rock and roll still had great acceptance in the public. In those years bands such as \"The Moonlights\" had national and international recognition, who achieved successes such as \"Tijuana Funky\" or \"Are you\"; the \"Rockin Devils\", recognized for their Spanish cover of \"Bule Bule\", which achieved international success. The Roble Cinema, La Caba\u00f1a club and Flamingos club, would be some of the main stages of the decade for musical performances in the city.56\nIn the 70s, rock groups and musicians experienced government rejection and censorship for the lyrics of the songs. Romantic music took a boom and from there came bands like \"The Battle of Tijuana\", \"Los Solitarios\", \"Los Terr\u00edcolas\", \"Old Memories\", \"Tito Pantoja and his friends\", \"Ritmo 7\", \"Los Old Friends \",\" California Brass \"and \"Los Corazones Solitarios\", among others.\nIn the late 80s, Antonio De Carlo, was recognized as a revelation artist at the OTI Festival, having a successful career during the 90s, with songs such as \"In A Thousand Pieces\", \"A Pecho Discovery\", \"Revolution\" and \"Like It Hurts \". Lynda also gained national relevance in pop, achieving hits in songs like \"Lost Heart\", \"Tell\", \"A Thousand for an Hour\", among others.\nDespite the downturn in rock artists for some years, in the 90s Tijuana No! emerged, returning a bit of the genre to the city. They also incorporated ska, punk and reggae. \"No\" would be the first album released, from which successes like \"Pobre de ti\", which had Julieta Venegas as a vocalist, would emerge. Later the singer began her solo career already in the 00s of the 21st century. Her musical career reached the recording of six studio albums, and she won two Grammys, six Latin Grammys, six MTV Latin America and two Latin Music Billboard.\nThe city continued to be a hotbed of important rock bands, among them, especially at the international level, Specimen, other bands and prominent artists could be Ohtli, Nona Delichas, Canseco, Sonoro 2 and Headlongs. Electronic music boomed in the 90s, Murcof and the Nortec Collective, entered the scene and began to gain worldwide recognition for merging electronic music with northern and band music. This group was enriched with the visual contribution of designers and videographers who, under the same concept, provided images to this musical proposal.\nRegarding Mexican regional music, some groups of the northern genre were emerging, highlighting Los Tucanes de Tijuana, who since the 80s began their musical career until popularizing songs such as \"La Chona\", \"El Tucanazo\", \"La Chica Sexy\", among others. The Agua Caliente Band, Explosi\u00f3n Norte\u00f1a, among others, would be a new generation of Mexican popular music artists.\nAmong other things, Tijuana has been the inspiration for the birthplace of Nortec music style and Ruidoson, resulting in a very large and active electronic music scene where groups and artists like Los Macuanos, Maria y Jose, Siberium, Hidhawk and Harpocrates emerged. Tijuana also enjoys a large base of support in many other musical scenes such as mexican hip hop, reggae, hardcore, punk, black metal and house music. Famous musicians are from Tijuana including the pop-rock singer-songwriter Lynda Thomas and Vanessa Zamora and international indie punk bands like Delux and Los Kung-Fu Monkeys.\nTo promote the cultural development in children and youth of Tijuana, since 1996 the Tijuana Youth Symphony (SJT) has been promoted, which promotes education and musical training through instrument practices, music reading and public concerts. In addition, Tijuana has an opera season. There are also several musical festivals throughout the year, among which the Latin American Guitar Festival, Mainly Mozart Binacional, and the International Exhibition of contemporary dance \"Bodies in Transit\" stand out.\nTijuana is home to the Baja California Orchestra, one of the most prestigious and solid artistic institutions in northwestern Mexico, which was nominated for the Latin Grammy in the category of best classical album by the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Inc ., with the album Tango kills Danz\u00f3n kills Tango. This phonogram was distinguished as 'Best Classical Album of the year 2001' by the Mexican Union of Theater and Music Chroniclers. Currently, it maintains an annual season, offering symphonic and chamber music concerts in the most important forums of Tijuana and Baja California.\nAlready in the new century, many local bands have emerged, from all musical genres, some of them staying with local and national recognition. Highlights Nosis, High Slogan, Go Future, Ramona, The Children of the Saint, Among Deserts, Ziruela, Palos Verdes, Edwin, among others. Each of them have contributed and tried to revive the musical talent for which Tijuana has always been characterized.\nMusical clubs along the Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area and others often cater to a diverse range of tastes by offering nightly variations on musical fare, such as new wave music one night, and punk rock bands on the next. Some European metal bands whose members cannot perform in the United States due to prior felony convictions in their own countries play music festivals in Tijuana for fans from both Mexico and the United States.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city is home to the Tijuana Zonkeys professional basketball team of the CIBACOPA basketball league. The team is composed mostly of players from Mexico and plays from February to July in the Municipal Auditorium.\nThe city has a strong tradition of association football, Club Tijuana began playing in the Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n on the 2011/12 season, winning the 2012 Apertura title. They play their matches at the Estadio Caliente, a new 33,000 seat stadium. The team's mascot is the Xoloitzcuintle, a famous Mexican hairless dog.\nTijuana also has a long history of producing many world champion professional boxers, such as Antonio Margarito and Erik Morales.\n\n\n=== Stadiums ===\nEstadio Caliente\n\nThe stadium is the Estadio Caliente, match venue for Club Tijuana, a Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n football team. It is located in the Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Baja California (Mexico). Caliente Homes Stadium, is a multi-purpose center in Tijuana. It is mainly used for football matches, has a seating capacity of 21,000 spectators.  Opened in June 2008, according to the work schedule. It was a significant reason for Tijuana Club was promoted to the M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n; FEMEXFUT requires participating teams should have a stadium with a seating capacity of over 15,000. It is at this stage the U-17 FIBA Americas Championship 2009 was held bound for Nigeria. Was introduced in M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n during the Apertura 2011 tournament of the Mexican Football Federation.Estadio Chevron\n\nThe Chevron Stadium  is the home of the Toros de Tijuana. It opened in 1977 and housed the Colts missing Tijuana Mexican Pacific League. Subsequently, the stadium was used for football matches. For 2004, professional baseball returned, now with a franchise LMB under the name of Toros de Tijuana, which, the following year, changed its name to Colts as it had been known previously. At first the facility was called Cerro Colorado Stadium, due to its location at the foot of the hill of that name. With the return of baseball, chain supermarkets Calimax bought the naming rights to the stadium.  In 2004, the first season of Toros, the fans filled the stadium for most matches.  On April 4, 2013, the stadium was remodeled, marking the beginning of a new era for Toros de Tijuana.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\n\n\n==== Water ====\nThe Tijuana State Commission of Public Services (CESPT) supplies the city with its water, while the city receives its electricity from La Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE).\nIn 2019, due to extremely low water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir, CESPT began a city-wide water rationing scheme. This rationing scheme would divide Tijuana and nearby Rosarito into 5 zones. Each zone would be cut-off from the water supply on a rotating schedule of 4 days with water and 1 day without water. This scheme was expected to last for at least 2 months until the water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir were improved.\n\n\n==== Wastewater ====\nThe International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) developed, as a joint project of the USA and Mexico in the mid-1980s following substantial environmental studies, treats 25 million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Tijuana River; directly pumped across the border from the central collection point in Mexico. When the river is flowing, the diversion system of the plant begins operating and diverts up to about 12-13mgd to the IWTP. The total amount of water being diverted must not exceed 25 mgd, based on a monthly average decided upon by permit conditions, although the IWTP can treat sustained flows up to 45mgd daily and peaks of 70mgd for a short period. The diversion system regularly sends approximately six to eight million gallons of water daily to the IWTP. The plant is currently being upgraded to include a secondary treatment facility.\nThe city also four to five decentralize units that are part of the Tijuana/Rosarito Potable Water and Wastewater Master Plan. This plan was required as part of Public Law 106-457, put into order November 7, 2000, which was written to allow the Bajagua project to move forward. The master plan was a binational collaborative effort by EPA and CESPT and addressed San Diego-Tijuana's needs for the next 20 years. The plants are intended to treat approximately 5mgd each, to tertiary levels and provide the reclaimed water to the surrounding areas for agriculture, industry etc. There are several issues that they are facing: no infrastructure to convey the reclaimed water to customers and inadequate groundwater recharge infrastructure.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications ====\nTijuana's telephonic system operates under area code 664, but it is not the same area code 664 that is part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) because Mexico is not one of the countries represented in the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) where the country code is 1. So, to dial a phone number from San Diego to Tijuana requires an international access code and Mexico's Country Code, 52, before dialing the area code and the number.  It is similar for anyone calling from Tijuana to the United States.\nTelephonic landlines in Tijuana are provided by the company Telnor; other companies include Axtel, Izzi Telecom and Alestra. Popular cell phone carriers in the city-region include Movistar, Telcel, and AT&T Mexico. Many U.S. carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile offer free roaming in Mexico and it is possible to connect to U.S. based cell phone towers in many northern parts of the city. Cell phones also have historic usage in Tijuana as the first cellular call in Mexico was made in Tijuana in 1989.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nTijuana is a major gateway to the interior of Mexico to which it is connected by air and road directly, and by sea via the ports of Ensenada and San Diego. Within Tijuana there are freeways and other roads, and buses, but no passenger rail.\nLocal public transportation in Tijuana is run by semiprivate companies, and has one of the most complex, or perhaps unorganized networks.\n\n\n==== Air ====\nThe Tijuana International Airport (General Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez IA) is the city's main airport, one of the busiest in Mexico, and serves eleven airlines with destinations across Mexico and Shanghai, China. Tijuana Airport is also a second main airport for the San Diego area for passengers heading south into Mexico and Latin America, who may use the airport's Cross Border Xpress terminal located on the U.S. side of the border in Otay Mesa and connected to the rest of the airport on the Mexican side by a pedestrian toll bridge. U.S. and Canadian destinations can be reached via the San Diego International Airport, located about 35 kilometers (22 mi) north of the international border.\n\n\n==== Road ====\nTwo important Mexican federal highway corridors start in Tijuana, one of them is Fed 1, which runs south through the Baja California Peninsula through Rosarito Beach, Baja Mar, and Ensenada before ending in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. From Tijuana to Ensenada, most travelers take Fed 1D (scenic road), a four-lane, limited access toll road that runs by the coast starting at Playas de Tijuana. Fed 2 runs east for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) near the international border, as far as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua.\nWithin the metropolitan area the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 freeway connecte Mesa de Otay in the northeast of the city with Rosarito Beach in the southwest.\nJust north of the San Ysidro border crossing, Interstate 5 and Interstate 805 head northbound to San Diego and beyond. From the Otay Mesa border crossing, Interstate 905 takes drivers west to connect with both I-805 and I-5.\n\n\n==== Intercity buses ====\nThe city's main bus station is in its eastern borough. A small terminal downtown serves a few Mexican bus lines, and U.S.-based Greyhound Lines and Crucero USA. Another bus station near the border provides frequent service to Ensenada, and other major cities\u2014including Mazatl\u00e1n, Culiac\u00e1n, Hermosillo, and Guadalajara. Major bus lines operating in Tijuana include Azul y Blanco de Magallanes (Blue & White) and Transporte Efectivo Express de Tijuana \u2013 TEEXTI; modernizing system originally intended to phase out the other lines that partially introduced but ceased and merged with Azul y Blanco.\n\n\n==== Local buses ====\nIn 2006, Tijuana underwent a major overhaul of its existing system of guayines, or shared fixed-route station wagons, forcing the replacement of the guayines with new models of vans, serving as fixed-route taxis. Major transit hubs include Centro (Downtown Tijuana), Otay, Soler, and the Cinco y Diez avenues. Taxi lines operating in the city include Free Taxis, those that do not maintain a specific route; Economic Taxis; Diamond Taxis \u2013 black or yellow cabs; and regular taxis maintaining a set route. There are as many bus lines and routes as fixed-route taxi ones or calafias, and new routes for buses, taxis or calafias are frequently created, due to high demand of public transportation. Public transportation service is inexpensive, with bus tickets at maximum, USD $0.75. Fixed-route taxis are somewhat more expensive, depending on the taxi route, reaching USD $2.00. Bus, taxi and calafia lines and routes are distinguished from one another by their vehicles colors.\n\n\n==== Bus rapid transit ====\n\nA bus rapid transit system SITT operates one route from Downtown Tijuana and Garita Puerto Mexico near the San Ysidro Port of Entry, southeasterly along the Tijuana River to Terminal Insurgentes in the southeast of the city. It is part of a planned system of main and feeder lines to replace other buses and minibuses.\n\n\n==== Light rail ====\nPreviously there have been plans for a light rail service, for example in January 2009, the City Council and the Ministry of Communications and Transportation announced such a system along the Tijuana River, however so far nothing has come of these plans.There is, however, a light rail connection to downtown San Diego and beyond, starting immediately north of the San Ysidro Port of Entry to the U.S. at the San Ysidro Transit Center, where municipal buses also operate.\n\n\n==== Ride share ====\nRide share services Uber and DiDi operate throughout Tijuana and surrounding cities.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nTijuana has multiple sister cities and twin towns. These relations have been formalized by a variety of organizations as well as municipal governments. Currently twinned with the City of Tijuana are:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n Mexico portal\nTijuana Cartel\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nKun, Josh, and Fiamma Montezemolo, eds.

          "went to Mercado Hidalgo and decided to take a walk to Tijuana Cultural Center, almost empty place, no too much to see, one o two expositions.. nothing interesting.. continued to Plaza Rio Tijuana Shopping Mall for a diner",
          "I have seen several performances here and they have been excellent quality in a fabulous venue. This time, there was an artisan craft market going on as well which added to the festive quality of the evening out.",
          "You'd be surprised at some of the fascinating exhibits they get. For example, we saw an exhibit of medieval torture devices (very disturbing) and another time saw photography from all over the world. I especially like the garden with replicas of real Aztec deities.",
          "CECUT center is a must visit if you are in Tijuana, it's a Culture Center, ... It has a historic museum , and a theater that host a variety of events. From Musical , theater shows, Concerts, it has a OMNIMAX Theater, lecture rooms , with top writers.",
          "This is a large facility with a mega screen...2 different museums...large theater...presentation halls....killer book store and more. Many outside shows, fairs and the like. Check out the museum of the California's and more. The big concrete ball is a iMax theater. Worth a",
          "Nice place to see relax and cool off from the heat. ... and it's free. Just be careful taking pics. You can on somethings but kids all in spanish so if you do not read the language don't take any. Some neat things to see in here. It's pretty large and if you read add u go",
          "Incredible Omnimax movies. Interesting museum of the Baja California origins. Always there are some visiting exhibit weather in paintings, sculpture, etc. The fountain in the courtyard is fantastic",
          "the museum it has been part of tj for the longest time. Is the best place to visit to get to know the cultural aspect of tijuana. it has many movies and art galleries. is very family oriented.",
          "Spent the day at the venue. Lots to do & see. Loved the History of Baja Museum! The art section was cool but not my cup of tea. The Imaz was great but wife wished it was in English - I reminded her that we were in MEXICO ! Over all very well done - note: lots of schools on field",
          "We saw only the three galleries that were on one side of the building. It is a great facility and requires much more time than we allowed it. A knowledge of Spanish would be an asset here for sure. However the few precolonial pieces on display were well worth the price of",
          "Very helpful, friendly and educational. Loved all the wonderful art pieces. Very reasonable priced and I believe free on sundays.",
          "Everytime my family and I visit Tijuana, we make it a must to watch a film at the IMAX theater. Any film before 11am is only $1.50 which I think is a steal. Our only complaint is that the A/C was not working and it was very stuffy in there.",
          "Very pleasant art museum, local work, nice aesthetic change of pace from US museums. The building itself is worthwhile also. The natural history museum is kind of eh, but might be fun for kids",
          "had the pleasure to watch concha buika in concert at Cecuts Sala de Espectaculos. A great little venue for concerts and plays in tijuana rio zone. the acoustics are great and seating is numbered and comfortable.",
          "A very good place to visit for fun or just to know more of the cultural things related to Tijuana, there are small restaurants , big circular screen movies, theater, music, museum, art exhibitions, documentals, and a friendly staff. they have big and accesible parking lot.",
          "This complex features a history museum of the Californias, an OmniMax theatre, gift and book shops, coffee shops and sporadic cultural events. Check their website calendar for events. I've enjoyed going there often since I was a kid.",
          "Close to Rio Mall or Galeria with nice expositions going on at the time of my visit, righy after the visit just cross the street and have a nice bite at the mall which is well served of a variety of kinds of restaurants.",
          "Great place to visit!!! From i-max to theater. No se lo pueden perder. There's a great book store, expositions & many things to do.",
          "we viewed the exhibit on Baja California. Was interesting to see from their perspective. The site has potential as a cultural center but their programming is light, they are not geared toward tourists. The IMAX has good reviews but it makes me seasick so we didn't see it.",
          "It's just interesting to learn a history a city or place i visit. Interesting attraction. Enjoyed an educational movie in IMAX",
          "It could use a paint job. Besides that, it is one of the finest structures in Tijuana. If you're coming from the US, leave your expectations in the states when you visit Mexico. Look with fresh eyes. If you're going to visit CECUT, don't go when it's boring. Follow their web",
          "Interesting attraction, but overall, not as informative (or clean) as we'd thought it would be. There are a number of people there to answer questions.",
          "Unless you are from Tijuana, the last thing you think about is \"Cultural Center\". As a Tijuanense (what us native Tijuana peeps are called), I can honestly say this OmniMax/Planetarium theater is world class. I have been to IMAXs and planetariums all over the U.S. and Europe,",
          "This is a must if you know your spanish the theater is incredible inside and out! It has a very iconic shape you cant miss it.",
          "When visiting Tijuana, try to see where the locals go. Not only is the cultural center an architectural feat, but the exhibits, performances and people watching is worth the detour from the tourist area.",
          "The options are very good, you always have a good educational movie in the IMAX, several expositions of art. the place is well maintained and located. Even if you have a couple of hours to spare this is a good option.",
          "If you are coming to Tijuana for vacation or a day trip then CECUT is a must. During my visit I decided to do their permanent exhibit of Museum of Californias (Museo de las Californias), the aquarium and walk through their gardens. The museum was a walk through the history of",
          "Although we visited on a Monday and everything was closed, we were still able to tour the jaw dropping CECUT with its amazing architecture that so well speaks to modern Mexico with a traditional language from its ancient cultures. A landmark!",
          "Everyone who visits Tijuana should try to find some time to visit the Culteral Center (Spanish Acronym CECUT). There is a lovely free botanical garden, an IMAX theater, a concert hall, a permanent history of the Californias exhibit and multiple traveling exhibits. The new",
          "Lots of activities for families and young children,Sunday so some attractions were free. Attractions include Imax, art galleries, exhibit on the history of Baja, aquarium and while we were there a performance of traditional Mexican dancing. Worth a visit.",
          "Oh CECUT, how you do try. And don't... I probably know a bit more about the politics of this place than most tourists passing through, but I'll spare you so many details and recommend checking it out - without any expectations. (I should put that in bold lettering, but I don't",
          "In San Diego, we were picked up by Viotar touring bus and the driver's name was Mike. Before we could enter into Mexico we had to go through customs and get our passports stamped, armed police with machine guns. Once we were cleared to enter we were picked up by our tour bus.",
          "Loved the Cultural Center in downtown Tijuana. We visited on a Sunday so some attractions were free. Attractions include Imax, art galleries, exhibit on the history of Baja, aquarium and while we were there a performance of traditional Mexican dancing. Worth a visit.",
          "very good theater and museum, close to Pacific Dental Tijuana, where I visited Dr Lutz for a fantastic routine visit, had some work done last week and visited the theater about 2 blocks from his place",
          "Did think they did a good job on the main exhibit BUT to see the Aquarium, and any of the others, each one had another charge. Lots of walking. It was to hot to walk the gardens which were free. gift shop very pricey",
          "Cheap underground parking, two book shops, clean bathrooms, great art exhibits and spaces. Near a mall and restaurants a mile to the border.",
          "Sometimes they have a lot of events , but there is no budget for promoting their attractions and you have to do all the work looking for schedules and things of that nature. Very comfortable and classic modern look.",
          "We spent two hours at the Cultural Center, and learned a lot about Baja California and Mexico. It was extremely interesting.",
          "Have attended concerts, comedianes and art displays many times at CeCut. Centrally located in Zona Rio CeCut provides a wide variety of events and activities throughout each month with special artists, IMAX theatre films, political and cultural talks as well as just fun",
          "As my hometown i recomend the CECUT as the place ti visit while in Tijuana. It has a museum with Baja California history, art and photo expos all around the year, an aquarium, free matinee, shows, concerts,ballet,theater & the IMAX dome known in here as \"la bola\" . The prices",
          "Enjoyed both exhibits. Outdoor garden very nicely done. Loved the architecture. Did not stay for Imax film.",
          "We were so worried about going here with all the murders reported in this little city, so we took a tour. We felt very safe, however the only place we were let off is Revolutionary street were you can do nothing but eat and shop. its all about bargaining. You have the haggle and",
          "The Cecut is a great place to go see art and IMAC shows. They also do a lot of fun festivals, some are free and some have a cover. We've seen local bands, salsa bands, spanish rock bands. The Imac shows are great and the museum inside about Baja California is very interesting.",
          "Museum , IMAX theater and gallery all combined what else can u ask for, near to the shopping center mall and food district",
          "We took a tour bus that offered few hour tours to Tijuana. There they let us out to shop and eat. Stroll around a bit to find neat souvenirs. We also tried a taco restaurant too. It was a bit sad to see children begging on the street and selling gum to bring money home.",
          "When you come to Tijuana, your #1 priority should be visiting CECUT. Start with the museum, and then finish your tour by watching a film in the Omnimax theater, one of the best experiences you'll ever have. Also, check the schedule, you may be lucky enough to catch a food, music",
          "We go here everytime we are in TJ - you will never know what you might find. We attended an amazing free concert once -- We use CECUT as a central place to meet friends when we travel to TJ, but often, we go inside and enjoy it first.",
          "The city is growing, and so is the cultural experience in Tijuana. with the new Tijuana Cultural Center there are always great festivals with traditional folk dancing, traditional foods, art and expositions, not to mention the Omnimax theater",

          "We used the San Diego Scenic Tours company for an afternoon in Tijuana on 5-30-13. The experience with this company was excellent. I will definitely use them again since it was a great price, professional and fun. We did the San Diego & Tijuana Tours (Tour A-222). They picked us",
          "My teen grandkids wanted to cross the border, but what do do there to justify the drive? I do not like to drive across the border, I walk, so I needed something within walking distance. I searched for something clean and interesting that reflected the culture rather than the",
          "Since the new director arrived CECUT has gottn a facelift inside and out. Everything has changed for the better. If you haven't been there for a while I definitely recommend you go again...Love watching the IMAX movies",
          "Check out the dates for the book fair. It was wonderful just wish I had known about it in advance. Live music, food, authors, and of course, loads of books-Spanish/English.",
          "CECUT really has lots of nice expositions every now and then. Not to mention, the screening of many foreign films and the IMAX dome which is a landmark of the city. They added an aquarium that is good for the price you pay (about 3-5 Dlls I think) some really nice fish but it's",
          "Boring...there was nothing going on while we were there. I would call ahead to make certain you can actually do something.",
          "We spent five hours here seeing exhibits in the Cultural Center and an IMax movie in the beautiful theatre known as \"La Bola\". We came across surprising performances in different parts of the complex including Folklorico Dance, bands and singers. On Sundays the museum is free",
          "Stopped in here with a friend to see what was new. It was my first time here. It was definitely worth a visit. Tijuana has such a negative imagine north of the border which is definitely misplaced. I was surprised at what this place has to offer. People were practicing",
          "There is opera, music and theatre and an interesting local community attending, also many San Diego residents are subscribed to regular programmes. Probably the most active cultural center in Baja California.",
          "Tijuana can be a little intimidating, especially if you haven't been there for awhile. But the area near CECUT is an oasis of calm and beauty. CECUT is a \"find.\" It is a gem - one of the great secrets of this border city. Its architecture can rival any museum in the US.",
          "Most people who visit Tijuana never see the attactions of this area. There is a performing arts center that has world class ballet, music, and other shows. The museum has revolving exhibits including recently a macabre display of execution equipment. The art museum is small",
          "We drove down from San Diego for a day trip, left the car in the USA and walked over, it was a great day of experience, colour and sunshine... we ate some fantastic food, and had some beers in the sun, enjoyed the markets and outdoor music, did a bit of shopping... It was",

          "Modern, architecturally beautiful building-- clean lines and open spaces. I visited with friends today and just had to write a great review for them. The staff at the museum is helpful and will stay out of your way. The area around the ticket booth is used for photography",
          "This very modern, architecturally interesting building houses a range of exhibits and programs, some but not all for free. On the January day we visited there was an intriguing show of hanging panels (some painted, others in montage) featuring artists from all of Latin America.",
          "An exhibit of the Mexican surrealist. Extensive exhibit of sculpture paintings, prints. Excellent art. Excellent presentation and venue,",
          "great mo 3D movies. it always has expositions, art , theater plays, pain exhibits; you name it. CECUT is one of Tij icons",
          "Visited this weekend for a big art exhibition, many many local artists in a festival type presentation food stall and music, did not go to museum this time around but looks like they have renovated a lot since last time I was there.",
          "Most Americans think of Tijuana in terms of downtown, cheap beer and crime. But there's another Tijuana of elegant suburbs, excellent restaurants and great art. CECUT is a fabulous establishment. Its exhibition on Baja alone is worthwhile -- highly creative and excellently",
          "Saw a movie their theater, seats not as comfortable as a Cinepolis and small screen. Volume was too low, but wide isles if you need to get out and not bother others too much. The IMAX theater needs better titles like USA IMAX locations. Remodeling was in progress, hopefully",
          "Very interesting visit, I hadn't been aware of the diverse selection of cultural and educational events it offers. Worth a visit.",
          "Took taxi drive to museum, ($3.00) and was kinda lost when I got there. They are working in construction onsite and I didn't even know if the place was open. I was so lost and confused, but I asked and was directed to the ticket booth where I paid $5.00 for three tickets to see",
          "This place has a museum and an omnimax. Plays and conserts and more everyday. if you want culture here you will find it.",
          "nice imax show and the place is beautiful. The rio plaza is a close walk and the taxi from Revolucion only cost me 30 pesos.",
          "Enjoyed a wonderful art exhibit here, I thought from reading the outside I was going to see a Freida C. exhibit, but my spanish was rusty and it was more modern art, but it was really good and interesting.",
          "love their CUBO , just the place to walk around w/ a cup of coffe , they have ENTIJUANARTE comming a must to check out",
          "Famous for tis \"globe like\" IMAX teather, this cultural center has a very nice areas. I was here to visit an international congress of entrepreneaurs. And before that I ente to watch an IMAX movie.",

          "wether it been taking the kids to an amazingly produced play, browsing the current artist in residence expo or taking a casual guitar class taught by a prodigious 13 year old, this place has everything you need for a fun and relaxing cultural outing - don't miss out the constant",
          "The Museo de las Californias was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. It has tons of replicas of, as well as a few original, artifacts and detailed explanations of everything on display. I also really liked all the old photographs of TJ and pictures taken from the air back",
          "If you're headed to Tijuana for a day or three, I highly recommend spending a few hours at CECUT (Centro Cultural Tijuana), the cultural center of the city located in Zona Rio (a nice area). There are art exhibitions, an OMNIMAX theatre, an archaeological outdoor garden museum,",
          "This place made our Tijuana visit really memorable. The history of northern Baja inside is fascinating, the IMAX theater is excellent, and we even saw the Grammy-nominated Baja Orchestra play in the new orchestra hall, which has excellent acoustics. For anybody who thinks"

        "wiki": "Tijuana (US:  tee-(H)WAH-n\u0259, Spanish: [ti\u02c8xwana] (listen)) is the largest city of both Baja California State and the Baja California Peninsula. It is part of the San Diego\u2013Tijuana transborder urban agglomeration and the larger Southern California megalopolis. As the 6th-largest city in Mexico and center of the 6th-largest metro area in Mexico, Tijuana exerts a strong influence in education and politics \u2013 across Mexico, in transportation, culture and art \u2013  across all three Californias (the U.S. state of California, Baja California and Baja California Sur), and in manufacturing and as a migration hub \u2013 across the North American continent. Currently one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in Mexico, Tijuana maintains GaWC 'sufficiency city' status. As of 2015, the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,641,570.Tijuana is located on the Pacific coast of Baja California, and is the municipal seat and the cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality (Mexican states are divided into municipalities, rather than counties as in the U.S.). Tijuana covers 70% of the territory of the municipality and contains 80% of its population. A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent, the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies. In the early 21st century,  Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America. Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca. The city is the most visited border city in the world; sharing a border of about 24 km (15 mi) with its sister city San Diego. More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year. This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the fourth busiest land-border crossing in the world. It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone.Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico.  According to the 2015 census, the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico, with a population of 1,840,710, but rankings vary, the city (locality) itself was 6th largest and the municipality (administrative) 3rd largest nationally.  The international metropolitan region was estimated at about 5,158,459 in 2016, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region, 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas, and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico.  Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego.\nTijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias. As the American occupation of the Mexican capital ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Tijuana's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure. The city was founded on July 11, 1889 as urban development began. Often known by its supposed initials, T.J., and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico, the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe city's name comes from the rancho that Santiago Arg\u00fcello Moraga established in 1829 on his Mexican land grant, naming it Rancho T\u00eda Juana.The first Spanish mission call the settlement variously as La T\u00eda Juana, Tiguana, Tiuana, Tiwana, Tijuan, Ticuan, as well as Tijuana. While the Mexican city standardized to Tijuana, the American term for both the river and a U.S. settlement which is now part of San Ysidro remained T\u00eda Juana until the mid-20th century.\nThe commonly accepted theory among historians is that T\u00eda Juana, as Arg\u00fcello named his rancho, is derived from the word Tiwan (\"by the sea\") in the language of the Kumeyaay\u2014the original aboriginal inhabitants of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Urban legend, however, states that T\u00eda Juana, which means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, was a real person whose inn provided food and lodging to travelers. There is however no record of such an inn; in fact the first building in the area was built by Arg\u00fcello in any case, after naming his ranch Rancho T\u00eda Juana.\n\n\n=== Nicknames ===\nIn Southern California, Tijuana is often referred to as TJ or T.J. Baja Californians have adopted this pronunciation as Tiyei. In Spanish the demonym for someone from Tijuana is Tijuanense, while in English the demonym is Tijuanan. A very common slang term used for a person from Tijuana is Tijuanero.The nickname Tijuas is increasingly popular among residents and visitors alike. Due to a recent increase in violence in the city, a new term is developing. The phrase Yo Tijuaneo, \u00bfy t\u00fa? translates to I Tijuanate, and you?. This term comes from a new popular local verb Tijuanear meaning to Tijuana, describing the cosmopolitan aspects of living in the city and frequently crossing the border.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe land was originally inhabited by the Kumeyaay, a tribe of Yuman-speaking hunter-gatherers. Europeans arrived in 1542, when the explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo toured the coastline of the area, which Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno mapped in 1602. In 1769, Juan Cresp\u00ed documented more details about the area that was later called the Valley of Tijuana. Jun\u00edpero Serra founded the first mission of Alta California in nearby San Diego.\nFurther settlement took place near the end of the mission era when Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda, governor of the Baja California and Alta California, awarded a large land grant to Santiago Arg\u00fcello in 1829. This large cattle ranch, Rancho T\u00eda Juana, covered 100 km2 (40 sq mi). Although \"Tia Juana\" means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, the name was actually an adaptation of the word 'Tihuan' or 'Tiju\u00e1n' in the Kumeyaay language, the name of a nearby Kumeyaay settlement and whose meaning is disputed.In 1848, as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War with the United States, Mexico lost all of Alta California. The majority of the 1,000 Hispanic families living in Alta California stayed there, though some moved south to remain inside Mexico. Because of this Tijuana gained a different purpose on the international border. The area had been populated by ranchers, but Tijuana developed a new social economic structure. These were farming and livestock grazing, plus as a transit area for prospectors.\n\n\n=== 1889\u20131915: Town established ===\nUrban settlement began in 1889, when descendants of Santiago Arg\u00fcello and August\u00edn Olvera entered an agreement to begin developing the city of Tijuana. The date of the agreement, July 11, 1889, is recognized as the founding of the city. Tijuana saw its future in tourism from the beginning. From the late 19th century to the first few decades of the 20th century, the city attracted large numbers of Californians coming for trade and entertainment. The California land boom of the 1880s led to the first big wave of tourists, who were called \"excursionists\" and came looking for echoes of the famous novel \"Ramona\" by Helen Hunt Jackson.\nIn 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, revolutionaries claiming loyalty to Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n took over the city for shortly over a month. Federal troops then arrived. Assisted by the \"defensores de Tijuana\", they routed the revolutionaries, who fled north and were promptly arrested by the United States Army.\nThe Panama-California Exposition of 1915 brought many visitors to the nearby California city of San Diego. Tijuana attracted these tourists with a Feria T\u00edpica Mexicana \u2013 Typical Mexican Fair. This included curio shops, regional food, thermal baths, horse racing and boxing.\n\n\n=== 1916\u20131935: Gambling and drinking destination ===\nThe first professional race track opened in January 1916, just south of the border gate. It was almost immediately destroyed by the great \"Hatfield rainmaker\" flood of 1916. Rebuilt in the general area, it ran horse races until the new Agua Caliente track opened in 1929, several miles south and across the river on higher ground.\nLegal drinking and gambling attracted U.S nationals in the 1920s during Prohibition. The Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area became the city's tourist center, with casinos and the Hotel Caesar's, birthplace of the Caesar salad.\nIn 1925, the city by presidential decree changed his name to   ciudad Zaragoza, but its name reverted to Tijuana in 1929.\nIn 1928, the Agua Caliente Touristic Complex was opened, including hotel, spa, dog-track, private airport, golf course and gambling casino. A year later, the new Agua Caliente Racetrack joined the complex. During the eight years it operated, the Agua Caliente hotel, casino and spa achieved a near mythical status, with Hollywood stars and gangsters flying in and playing. Rita Hayworth was discovered there. Musical nightclub productions were broadcast over the radio. A singer known as \"la Faraona\" got shot in a love-triangle and gave birth to the myth of a beautiful lady ghost. Remnants of the Agua Caliente casino can be seen in the outdoor swimming pool and the \"minarete\" (actually a former incinerator chimney) nearby the southern end of Avenida Sanchez Taboada, on the grounds of what is now the Lazaro Cardenas educational complex.\n\n\n=== 1935\u20131965: Tourism broadens ===\nIn 1935, President C\u00e1rdenas decreed an end to gambling and casinos in Baja California, and the Agua Caliente complex faltered, then closed. In 1939, it was reopened as a junior high school (now, Preparatoria L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas). The buildings themselves were torn down in the 1970s and replaced by modern scholastic architecture.\nWith increased tourism and a large number of Mexican citizens relocating to Tijuana, the city's population grew from 21,971 to 65,364 between 1940 and 1950.\n\nWith the decline of nightlife and tourism in the 1950s, the city restructured its tourist industry, by promoting a more family-oriented scene. Tijuana developed a greater variety of attractions and activities to offer its visitors.\n\n\n=== 1965\u20132001: The city matures ===\nIn 1965 the Mexican federal government launched the Border Industrialization Program to attract foreign investment. Tijuana and other border cities became attractive for foreign companies to open maquiladoras (factories), and the Tijuana economy started to diversify. Manufacturing jobs attracted workers from other parts of Mexico and the city's population grew from less than half a million in 1980 to almost 1 million in 1985.\nIn 1972, work began on the first concrete channeling of the Tijuana River; previously the river would flood across a wide plain east and southeast of downtown, inundating an area of wood, cardboard and metal shacks called Cartolandia (\u201cPaperland\u201d).  The project removed the shacks and added 1.8 million sq. m. of usable land, on which the Zona R\u00edo was built. With the 1981 opening of the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana mall and the 1982 Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT), Zona R\u00edo became the new commercial center of a modern Tijuana, and with its new boulevards with monument-filled glorietas (roundabouts), reminiscent of the grand Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, the city created the new image and allure of a modern, large city, rather than just a border town focused on tourism and vice.In 1994, PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana while making an appearance in the plaza of Lomas Taurinas, a neighborhood nestled in a valley near Centro. The shooter was caught and imprisoned, but doubts remain about who the mastermind might have been.\n\n\n=== 2001\u20132011: Violence and decline of US tourism ===\nAfter 9/11, tighter US border controls resulted in hours-long waits to return to the US. The number of US visitors dropped sharply due to this factor, as well as subsequent drug violence.Around 2008, thousands of Tijuana's elite bought houses in and moved to Bonita and Eastlake in Chula Vista, California to escape violence, kidnapping and other crimes taking place during that period. An article in The Los Angeles Times reported that the emigration to San Diego County has transformed the demographic and cultural character of some cities to a degree.\n\n\n=== 2011\u2013present: Tijuana strengthens ===\nIn recent years, Tijuana has become an important city of commerce and migration for Mexico and US. In spite of the violence and border crossing issues, the city has received a large number of tourists from US, China, Japan and the south of Mexico. Thanks to the realization of cultural and business festivals, the city has improved its image before the world, standing out as a competitive city for investment. Currently, the commercial and business sector is committed to the boom in the gastronomic industry, craft beer, entertainment and real estate, as well as medical tourism, to attract visitors and investors.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTijuana is the westernmost city in Mexico, and consequently in Latin America, and the second largest city of northern Mexico. Located about 210 kilometers (130 mi) west of the state capital, Mexicali, the city is bordered to the north by the cities of Imperial Beach, and the San Diego neighborhoods of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, California. To the southwest of the city is Rosarito Beach, while to the south is unincorporated territory of Tijuana Municipality. The city is nestled among hills, canyons, and gullies. The central part of the city lies in a valley through which flows the channeled Tijuana River.\nHousing development in the Tijuana Hills has led to eradication of many seasonal mountain streams. This lack of natural drainage makes places within the city vulnerable to landslides during the rainy season. The varied terrain of Tijuana gives the city elevation extremes that range from sea level to 790 meters (2,590 ft).\nTijuana is noted for its rough terrain, which includes many canyons, steep hills, and mesas. Among noted canyons in Tijuana are Canyon K and Canyon Johnson. Large Tijuana hills include Red Hill (Cerro Colorado) and Hill of the Bees (Cerro de las Abejas) in the eastern part of the city.\nThe city is located near the terminus of the Tijuana River and within the Tijuana River Basin. The Tijuana River is an intermittent river, 195 km (121 mi) long, on the Pacific coast of northern Baja California in Mexico and Southern California in the United States. It drains an arid area along the California\u2013Baja California border, flowing through Mexico for most of its course and then crossing the border for the last 8 km (5 mi) of its course where it forms an estuary that empties into the ocean. The river's lower reaches harbor the last undeveloped coastal wetlands in San Diego County, and some of the last in Southern California, amidst a highly urbanized environment at the southern city limits of Imperial Beach.\nAs downtown Tijuana was built at the bottom of the river valley, the district is subject to seasonal flooding created by drain-off from the Tijuana Hills. During this time, east-bound portions of the Via Rapida (east-west highway) may be blocked off by the Tijuana Police due to hazardous conditions.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city's skyscraper history is relatively recent. Some of the first highrise building complexes constructed in the city were the twin towers of Grand Hotel Tijuana. Tijuana experienced a building boom that was brought to a halt by the Great Recession. Among buildings that succumbed to the time period was the Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico that would have been located in Playas and reached 98 m (322 ft). Currently the tallest building, and soon to be the largest complex in footage, New City Residential reaches 102 m (335 ft). Overall, the city maintains 33 completed structures with other proposed and under-construction skyscrapers.\n\nThe Tijuana skyline is the fifth largest skyline in Mexico and is located in the Zona Rio and to a smaller extent, Playas de Tijuana. In the Zona Rio the buildings are concentrated on the Tijuana River, lined parallel to the river; and on the edges of the Tijuana Country Club. In Playas the high rises are currently focused on the coast. Recent construction on high rises has begun in the aforementioned areas, as buildings such as New City Residential and Grand Hotel Tijuana have been developed and taken prominent places in the skyline as the tallest buildings. From Tijuana's skyline the San Diego skyline can also be seen, although the reverse is mostly not true on account of the high hills surrounding central Tijuana.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Tijuana is divided into eight administrative boroughs, or Delegaciones. The Tijuana metropolitan area occupies all of borough seats. The boroughs are in turn divided into colonias or ejidos. These boroughs offer administrative services such as urban planning, civil registry, inspection, verification, public works and community development and are served by a delegado.\n\nCentro \u2014 \"Delegaci\u00f3n Centro\" includes the old downtown (Zona Centro), new business district (Zona R\u00edo), red light district (Zona Norte), and other adjacent neighborhoods (\"zonas\"). This is the historical midpoint of Tijuana; the municipal palace is located here as well as most of the tourist zones, such as Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n and the business district. The Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT for CEntro CUltural de Tijuana) is located here as well as the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana, until recently the largest mall in the state, within the Zona Rio.\nCerro Colorado \u2014 The Cerro Colorado (\"Red Hill\") is located here and it is surrounded by houses. Because of its height many of the area's antennae for radio and television stations are located on its peak.\nLa Mesa \u2014 This is where the Morelos Park, the largest public park in the city, is located, as well as the retail and transit hub Cinco y Diez, Plaza Mundo Divertido, the new Macroplaza and the CETYS University.\nOtay Centenario \u2014 This borough was created in 2014 by merging Mesa de Otay and Centenario boroughs. In this borough sits the Tijuana International Airport.  The Tijuana campus of the Autonomous University of Baja California and the Technologico are also located here as well as many maquiladoras. This is the borough with the largest number of factories and maquiladoras. Its largest colony is Ciudad Industrial (\"Industrial City\"). Three of the city's most important streets, Boulevard Bellas Artes, Boulevard Industrial and Fed 2, are located here.  This delegacion contains the Otay Mesa entry to the United States and the Friendship Park (Parque de la amistad).\nPlayas de Tijuana \u2014 This is the westernmost borough of the city bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the United States border on the north. This is where the beaches of Tijuana are located (hence the name) and it is also one of the two exits to the south towards Rosarito and Ensenada.\nLa Presa \u2014 literally \"'the dam'\", this is the largest borough in size and the Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez Dam is located within its limits, hence its name. The new Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 and the Tijuana-Tecate freeways run through it.\nSan Antonio de los Buenos \u2014 This is mostly a residential area although it also has two industrial parks.\nSanchez Taboada \u2014 Like the previous borough this is mostly a residential area, but within its borders are located many \"maquiladoras\" specially at Pacific Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTijuana's climate is a semi-arid (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh), with about 231 mm (9.09 in) of annual precipitation, and generally mild to warm weather year-round. It has characteristics of the Mediterranean climate (Csa) found to the immediate north, with most of the annual precipitation falling in the winter, between the months of November and March.\n\nBetween November and March, storms originate from fronts entering off of the Pacific Ocean. January is the wettest month of the year for the city and during this time a periodic event, similar to June Gloom, is observed created by marine layer. January is the coolest month, during which temperatures average 13.6 \u00b0C (56.5 \u00b0F). In the city April signifies the end of winter and the start of Santa Ana winds. Though the daytime highs are generally around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), heat waves can reach up to 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F). The hottest months in the city are August and September, during which temperatures average 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Summers are by far the driest time of year since influences from the California Current and the North Pacific High suppress the formation of rainfall caused by the North American Monsoon. As in coastal Southern California, air pollution sometimes occurs during periods of temperature inversion, especially during summer and fall, but (unlike Mexico City) is seldom severe and in recent years has lessened due to cleaner car engines.Frost and snow are rare phenomena in the city as temperatures are usually well above freezing. Yet, in December 1967, snow fell in the city and in January 2007 feather light snow fell in the east of the city. However, excessive amounts of snow fall have never been recorded in the city. On February 14, 2008 a winter storm caused an unusual snowfall in the upper reaches of the hills of the city.\nThe record low temperature recorded in the city was \u22126 \u00b0C (21 \u00b0F), while the highest was 49 \u00b0C (120 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nTijuana has a diverse cosmopolitan population which includes migrants from other parts of Mexico and from all over the world. Tijuana has one of Mexico's largest Asian populations, predominantly consisting of Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese immigrants. Tijuana also has a large and rapidly growing population of United States citizens, mostly from Southern California.  Many Latin Americans, notably Cubans, and Guatemalans, have made Tijuana their home. The city also has many Lebanese, Italian, French, Spanish citizens. Recently, the city has received a large influx of Haitian immigrants.\n\nThe majority of Tijuana's migrant Mexican population hail from Sinaloa, Michoac\u00e1n, Jalisco, Oaxaca, and the Federal District. Because of the diversity of Mexico and the influx of immigrants from almost every region in the country, there are no accurate estimates on ethnicity or race of the current population. The heavy influx of immigrants to the city and municipality of Tijuana has led to job creation in the form of over 700 twin-plant (maquiladora) factories, which serve as the basis of employment for the majority of the working-class people in northern Mexico.  The high poverty level in Tijuana is attributed to the city's \"magnet status\" for people who have come from the poorer south of the nation and citizens from other nations seeking to escape from extreme poverty.  Tijuana holds a status that provides the possibility of employment as well as higher education and the dream of crossing the border.  Tijuana and Baja California in general have much stronger economies and higher incomes than other Mexican cities along the United States border, as well as more moderate weather.\nTijuana today is one of the fastest growing cities in Mexico with an average of 80,000 people moving to Tijuana yearly.  In terms of area, the city grows by approximately three hectares a day, mostly east and south as the city is mostly built out to the beach already with the exception of some canyons.  Along with settlements separated from Tijuana proper and other communities unimproved land, big business moves in providing supermarkets and retail to marginal areas, along with paved roads.  The city experiences the construction of 26,000 new settlers a year that has led to the unregulated, illegal squatter homes that takes place in the hills and valleys of ever expanding Tijuana, most of these areas are still without city services like sidewalks, paving, streetlights, and public transit. This is an ongoing process: as older and existing squatter areas are brought into the city services, more marginal areas become occupied by squatters.\nSquatter areas are home to displaced and uprooted people, among them the indigenous and poverty stricken, as well as migrants deported from the USA, many of whom are also without Mexican citizenship.  In recent years, working-class suburban housing estates have sprung up in the fringes to provide a sense of safety and land ownership.  These suburbs enable young families to isolate their families from the violence of the drug war and squatter areas.  These outlying communities tend to be much better equipped than their squatter counterparts.  Nevertheless, some remote areas are drug plantations for narcotics, and delinquency has spread to areas once considered safe havens.  These issues occasionally come to light in the newspapers.\nNational Population Council (CONAPO) data has estimated that by 2030, growth rates maintaining, the city will become the second largest in Mexico and anchor to the fourth largest metropolitan area in Mexico. The suburban sprawl observed in Tijuana leaves the downtown and beach areas relatively affluent.\n\nWhile the INEGI Census 2010 placed Tijuana's population at 1.3 million, only two percent more than in 2005 Census, Tijuana City Council estimates from 2010 place the population closer to two million, at 1.6 million. As funding for cities is based on the populace of the city, the Council worries about receiving adequate funds to provide for the needs of the city.  The population discrepancies may be explained by a few factors.  Shanty towns that have not been rasterized and an undercount, people having left Tijuana for United States, and people leaving Tijuana for the interior of Mexico due to the intensification of the drug war, and suburbanization outside city limits but still inside the municipality.  Tijuana, because of the dreams of border crossers, and its relatively higher wages compared to the rest of Mexico, naturally attracts immigrants.  Since an improvement in security since 2011, the population of Tijuana as reflected in the 2015 Mexican census is expected to return to its normal growth curve; the great reduction in violence should make the settlement of Tijuana an attractive option again versus fringe valleys, nevertheless exact figures from the census await.\nAccording to the Second Census of Population and Housing of the year 2010 conducted by the INEGI (National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics) the municipality of Tijuana has 1,559,683 inhabitants within 879 km2, the city or settlement of Tijuana only covers \u2154 of that area.  While the metropolitan area of Tijuana (1392 km2), composed of Tijuana Municipality and Rosarito Beach Municipality, has 1,751,302 inhabitants. Tecate Municipality, adjacent to Tijuana Municipality, has not yet been considered by the government as part of the metropolitan area.  However, there is great economic and cultural exchange between the cities regions though there are still expanses of rural land. As Tijuana grows, many of its suburbs have been built increasingly inland, and in the direction of Tecate; Valley of the Palms is a large planned city between the two.\nAs of 2005 the large majority of the city's population, 96%, adhere to the beliefs of Christianity. The denominations are further divided into followers of Catholicism \u2013 61% \u2013 and of Protestantism \u2013 35%.  While other beliefs occupying a 4% margin in the city include Taoism (among other Asian and European religions), atheism and agnosticism is also found.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nTijuana is the birthplace and base of the Tijuana Cartel.  From 2007 through 2010, Tijuana experienced an unusually high level of violent crime related to gang violence, in part derived from the Mexican drug war and human trafficking.  Homicides peaked in 2010, when 844 people were killed, compared with 355 in 2004 and 349 in the first eight months of 2011. Reportedly, the wave of violence resulted from a turf war as the administration of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n weakened the local Arellano F\u00e9lix cartel; violence slowed when the larger Sinaloa cartel took control.During peak years of violent crime in the city, gun battles between rival cartels, and between cartels and the police, erupted in public. In April 2008, police found 1,500 shell casings on various streets after one battle left 13 suspected drug traffickers dead. In 2009 and depending on the source, Tijuana Municipality experienced either 556 or 1,118 murders, mostly as a result of the drug war.There were 492 murders in 2013, a 48% increase in the homicide rate between 2012 and 2013. This was the highest number of murders since 2010. By the end of 2017, the number of murders in Tijuana increased to 1,744, which was almost double those in 2016.As of 2018, Tijuana had the highest per capita rate for homicides in the world at 138 murders per 100,000 people.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Region ===\n\nAt present the parties with greater presence in Tijuana are the National Action Party (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). The PAN has been the dominant party in the city for 20 years. Historically the PRI had been the dominant party in regional politics, until 1989 when the PAN began to dominate the city, until yet again, in 2004, PRI began regaining prominence and won the Mayor's Office.\nLess prominent parties also maintain relations with the dominant parties. These other parties, with less presence include the New Alliance Party (PANAL), Social Encounter Party (PES), and Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Allied with the PAN at the state and local level under the Alliance for Baja California are the Social Encounter Party (PES) and New Alliance Party (PANAL). Allied with the PRI at the state and local level under the \"Alliance for Better Living\" are the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) and Baja California State Party (PEBC).\n\n\n=== International ===\nTijuana's importance and rise to a global city has led to its recognition among countries worldwide. In addition to international cultural recognition, Tijuana has received political recognition and is a developing a political center currently host to eight consulates from European, Asian, and North American countries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\n\nTijuana is a large manufacturing center, and in addition to tourism, it serves as a cornerstone of the city economy. In the past decade alone, Tijuana became the medical device manufacture capital of the North American continent, surpassing previous leader Minneapolis - Saint Paul.The city's proximity to Southern California and its large, skilled, diverse, and relatively inexpensive workforce make it an attractive city for foreign companies looking to establish extensive industrial parks composed of assembly plants that are called maquiladoras, even more so than other cities in the US-Mexican border zone, taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to export products. At its peak, in 2001 Tijuana had roughly 820 of these 'maquiladoras'. Foreign and domestic companies employ thousands of employees in these plants, usually in assembly-related labor. Such jobs are not demanding but typically offer above average salaries for Mexico, with most maqiladoras jobs beginning at Mex$100 per day (about 5 US dollars, as of September 2016), significantly above the Mexican minimum wage of Mex$57.46 (about 3 US dollars, as of September 2016). Companies that have set up maquiladoras in Tijuana include Lanix, Hyundai, Sony, Vortec, BMW, Vizio, Toyota, Dell, Samsung, Kodak, Matsushita/Panasonic, GE, Nabisco, Ford, Microsoft, Cemex, Zonda, Philips, Pioneer, Airbus, Plantronics, Siemens Mexico, Jaguar, Pall Medical, Tara, Sanyo and Volkswagen. Many of the maquiladoras are located in the Otay Mesa and Florido sections of Tijuana.\nEconomic development has its central business district at Zona R\u00edo, which together, with the corridor along Blvd. Agua Caliente (the extension of Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n), contains the majority of the higher-end office space in the city.\n\n\n=== Tourist economy and entertainment ===\nTijuana also relies on tourism for a major part of its revenue. About 300,000 visitors cross by foot or car from the San Ysidro point of entry in the United States every day. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs, and shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are part of the draw for the city's tourists, many located within walking distance of the border. The city's tourist centers include Downtown Tijuana including the nightlife hot spots around La Sexta, Avenida Revolucion, souvenir shopping at the Mercado de Artesan\u00edas and Plaza Viva Tijuana, Tijuana's Cultural Center (CECUT) and neighboring Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana shopping center, and the city's best known vices, in the form of its legal Red Light District and gambling (Agua Caliente). Mexico's drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college aged Southern Californians who tend to stay on Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n.\nTijuana is also known for its red-light district Zona Norte (also referred to as La Coahuila after one of its main streets) with legal prostitution in strip clubs and on the street. The strip clubs are typically full-contact, meaning the dancers let patrons fondle them. Many dancers also sell their sexual services. In a 1999 estimation, there were 15,000 women engaged in prostitution in Tijuana outside of clubs and brothels.Tijuana has many pharmacies that target visitors from the United States, which sell some medicines without prescriptions and/or at much lower costs than in the U.S. Many medications still require a Mexican prescription, which can be obtained from adjacent doctors' offices. People filling up prescriptions for drugs classified in the US as Schedule II or Schedule III have found it more difficult to locate such medications, and the purchase of pseudoephedrine also has become restricted by Tijuana pharmacies, just as in the U.S. To fill a prescription in Tijuana for any drug covered by the US Controlled Substances Act  and legally bring it into the United States requires a prescription from the United States for re-import.  Americans can import up to a 90-day supply of non-controlled medications for personal use to the USA from Mexico and other countries.\nBusinesses such as auto detailing, medical and dental services and plastic surgery are heavily marketed, and are usually much less expensive than in the U.S.\nTijuana is headquarters for Mexico's largest gambling concern, Grupo Caliente, which operates the only casinos in the city, more than twenty branches.Tourists are sometimes robbed by municipal police.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nPlaza Rio Tijuana is a large regional mall anchored by Cin\u00e9polis, Sanborns, S\u00faper DAX and Sears.\nAll across the city, there are dozens of plazas comerciales, which may be strip malls or small enclosed or open-air centers, with a combination of any or all of the following anchors:\n\none of the 26 Tijuana branches of the small department store Coppel,\na supermarket or hypermarket,\na cin\u00e9polis or cinemex multicinema,\na branch of the electronics and motorcycle retailer ElektraAn important concentration of plazas is in the Cinco y Diez around an eponymous intersection, named for a former American-style five and dime store that was located there. It is also a major hub for public transit. Plaza Carrousel, with its namesake merry-go-round, is located here.\nCostco, Sam's Club, and Walmart each have multiple branches across the city.\nTraditional markets with vendors include the large Mercado Hidalgo in Zona R\u00edo, smaller neighborhood markets and the Mercado Municipal downtown.\nTijuana was the headquarters of 14-store Dorian's department store chain until its demise in 2009; most were converted to Sears stores.\n\n\n=== Culinary ===\nTijuana, along with the nearby Valle de Guadalupe, has recently become a culinary hotspot due to its Baja Med cuisine, including chefs such as Javier Plascencia, but also for its tacos, other street food, food trucks, coffee houses and artisanal beer.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTijuana is home to many private Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and High Schools as well as nationally high ranked colleges and universities. Notable primary and secondary schools include Metropolitan, Instituto M\u00e9xico, Instituto Cumbres, President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas School, Agua Caliente School Center High, Polit\u00e9cnico de Baja California(CLUB DE QU\u00cdMICA), Jos\u00e9 Fimbres Moreno School and the State High School, and Ignacio Ram\u00edrez School located in Cerro Colorado. These schools maintain recognition for their demands and high standards.\nTijuana maintains multiple higher education institutions. These include the Autonomous University of Baja California, Tijuana (UABC), Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Tijuana (ITT), Universidad Iberoamericana (UIA-Tijuana), CETYS Universidad, Universidad Xochicalco, and University of the Californias. Other colleges include Tijuana University Center, Tijuana University of Technology, Graduate Center of the Northwest, and the University of Professional Development. The city is the seat of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), an institution of scientific research and higher education, specializing in the study of the problems in the border region between Mexico and the United States. In August 2009, Metropolitan UABC opened in Valle de Las Palmas, in the Tijuana metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Culture and contemporary life ==\nMany foreigners travel to Tijuana to drink and dance, buy prescription drugs, purchase bootleg brand-name clothing, timepieces, and other personal accessories found globally, as well as manufactured and hand-crafted local curiosities. Locals and regular tourists avoid hassles by visiting the clubs at Plaza Fiesta or other areas of the Zona R\u00edo without the crowds, heavy marketing, and occasional tourist misbehavior or outright lawbreaking common on the Revoluci\u00f3n strip. However, Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n has been known for its proliferation of nightclub shows, primarily catering to casual tourists. While still an entertaining town with an enjoyable atmosphere, some locals and tourists feel it has lost an \"anything goes\" atmosphere, that was dangerous to locals, tourists, and the tourism industry.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nAs Tijuana matured from a tourist-oriented border town into one of Mexico's largest cities, the 1982 opening of the Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT) marked a milestone. CECUT's mission was to strengthening Tijuana's image, both to US visitors and to Mexicans, as a destination for culture and not only shopping and vice. The center includes an OMNIMAX cinema showing IMAX films, the Museum of the Californias, contemporary art exhibition halls, a restaurant, caf\u00e9, bookstore,  and other cultural facilities.\nLa Casa de la Cultura cultural center comprises a school, a theater, and a public library, and teaches dance, painting, music, plastic arts, photography and languages.\nOther cultural venues include the Instituto Municipal de Arte y Cultura (Municipal Institute of Art and Culture), the Tijuana Wax Museum, the Museo El Trompo (Trompo Museum), and El Foro, the former Jai Alai Palace, that is now a concert venue. Concerts are also held at the Estadio Caliente stadium, Hip\u00f3dromo Agua Caliente Racetrack, and at the \"Audiorama\" at the Museo El Trompo children's museum of science and technology.The Tijuana Country Club (Club Campestre de Tijuana) has many affluent members and a famous golf course and also functions as an entertainment and events venue. Tijuana also has a large Rotary Club.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\nParque Morelos has a small zoo and park space; Parque de la Amistad in Otay Centenario has a small pond, and a running and dirt-bike track. Parque Teniente Guerrero is a downtown park with a public library and weekend entertainment by clowns.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nTijuana's nightlife scene is one of the city's strongest attractions. The area surrounding \"La Sexta\", the intersection at Calle Sexta and Av. Revoluci\u00f3n, is now a major hub of new bars and dance clubs. Zona Rio, Tijuana's new Downtown, is home to some of the city's finest restaurants and bars. Another capstone of Tijuana's entertainment offerings is its adult nightlife industry, which includes the city's red light district as well as less conspicuous adult entertainment venues.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nTijuana also has a very active and independent artist community whose internationally recognized work has earned Tijuana the title of \"one of the most important new cultural meccas\", according to Newsweek, an exhibition of Tijuana's current art scene, is being curated by the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and is traveling across the USA in 2006 and 2007. Art collectives like Bulbo and film production like Palenque Filmaciones explore the use of film like the award-winning Tijuana Makes Me Happy, media like television bulbo TV and print \"bulbo PRESS\", to show different realities of Tijuana out of Mexico. In 2004, Tijuana earned international acclaim for an art exhibition displayed on the cement banks of the Tijuana River and along the Mexico/U.S. border fence in Otay Mesa.\nGraffiti is widespread in Tijuana. They can range from free-hand writing in spray can and marker form, often carrying social or sexual commentary in English or Spanish, pictures in wheatpaste and stencils, consisting of stenciled renderings of personalities crucial to Hispanic culture from past and present eras, such as television news announcers or stars, but also extending to images of artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed. Graffiti in Tijuana may seem at first to consist largely of simplistic tags and thus not as technically evolved, colorful, or accepted in the mainstream as the \"pieces\" of graffiti scenes of the United States, Europe, or Japan, but large, colorful graffiti murals adorn walls from both native Tijuanan artists as well as visiting graffiti writers, especially from California. The Tijuanan art pieces show as much prowess and skill as those made by their more renowned U.S. counterparts, although illicit graffiti are strongly discouraged by the Tijuana government, as in other major metropolitan areas.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nSince the decade of the 1920s, Tijuana has excelled in the musical field, thanks to the first groups of ranchera music that began to set the tourist establishments in the area with the visit of foreigners, including the former Casino Agua Caliente.\nRock music was very popular and popular among young people in the mid-50s, leaving the ranch rhythm aside years ago. Another event that added the arrival of Rock to Tijuana was the visit of the African-American pianist and guitarist, Gene Ross, who came to play at the Convoy Club on Revolution Avenue. The presence of this artist was the beginning of the rock scene in the region that marked a new style in the country.54 Some groupings of the nascent Mexican rock began, an example of which was \"The Tijuana Five\", who made some covers in Spanish of Anglo-Saxon successes.\nJavier Batiz founded in 1957 he founded a group called \"Los TJ's\" with which he collected musical influences that were received in the Mexican border cities of black music, blues and R&B from people like T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin 'Wolf, James Brown, among others. Later he would start his solo career in the rest of the country and participating in some bands in Mexico City.\nDuring the 60s, the American trumpeter Herb Alpert, in a visit to the bullfights made in the old Bullfight, found musical inspiration so after the recording of his single \"The Lonely Bull\", which was a radio hit in 1962. With the success, he decided to make a casting and formed \"The Tijuana Brass\", with whom he toured and had a presentation on television. It was a musical collaboration with artists from Los Angeles, with style called \"Tijuana Marimba\u00b4s Brass\". The band was dissolved in 1969 but they continued with some presentations under the name of T.J.B. 55\nAt the end of the 60s and during the 70s, rock and roll still had great acceptance in the public. In those years bands such as \"The Moonlights\" had national and international recognition, who achieved successes such as \"Tijuana Funky\" or \"Are you\"; the \"Rockin Devils\", recognized for their Spanish cover of \"Bule Bule\", which achieved international success. The Roble Cinema, La Caba\u00f1a club and Flamingos club, would be some of the main stages of the decade for musical performances in the city.56\nIn the 70s, rock groups and musicians experienced government rejection and censorship for the lyrics of the songs. Romantic music took a boom and from there came bands like \"The Battle of Tijuana\", \"Los Solitarios\", \"Los Terr\u00edcolas\", \"Old Memories\", \"Tito Pantoja and his friends\", \"Ritmo 7\", \"Los Old Friends \",\" California Brass \"and \"Los Corazones Solitarios\", among others.\nIn the late 80s, Antonio De Carlo, was recognized as a revelation artist at the OTI Festival, having a successful career during the 90s, with songs such as \"In A Thousand Pieces\", \"A Pecho Discovery\", \"Revolution\" and \"Like It Hurts \". Lynda also gained national relevance in pop, achieving hits in songs like \"Lost Heart\", \"Tell\", \"A Thousand for an Hour\", among others.\nDespite the downturn in rock artists for some years, in the 90s Tijuana No! emerged, returning a bit of the genre to the city. They also incorporated ska, punk and reggae. \"No\" would be the first album released, from which successes like \"Pobre de ti\", which had Julieta Venegas as a vocalist, would emerge. Later the singer began her solo career already in the 00s of the 21st century. Her musical career reached the recording of six studio albums, and she won two Grammys, six Latin Grammys, six MTV Latin America and two Latin Music Billboard.\nThe city continued to be a hotbed of important rock bands, among them, especially at the international level, Specimen, other bands and prominent artists could be Ohtli, Nona Delichas, Canseco, Sonoro 2 and Headlongs. Electronic music boomed in the 90s, Murcof and the Nortec Collective, entered the scene and began to gain worldwide recognition for merging electronic music with northern and band music. This group was enriched with the visual contribution of designers and videographers who, under the same concept, provided images to this musical proposal.\nRegarding Mexican regional music, some groups of the northern genre were emerging, highlighting Los Tucanes de Tijuana, who since the 80s began their musical career until popularizing songs such as \"La Chona\", \"El Tucanazo\", \"La Chica Sexy\", among others. The Agua Caliente Band, Explosi\u00f3n Norte\u00f1a, among others, would be a new generation of Mexican popular music artists.\nAmong other things, Tijuana has been the inspiration for the birthplace of Nortec music style and Ruidoson, resulting in a very large and active electronic music scene where groups and artists like Los Macuanos, Maria y Jose, Siberium, Hidhawk and Harpocrates emerged. Tijuana also enjoys a large base of support in many other musical scenes such as mexican hip hop, reggae, hardcore, punk, black metal and house music. Famous musicians are from Tijuana including the pop-rock singer-songwriter Lynda Thomas and Vanessa Zamora and international indie punk bands like Delux and Los Kung-Fu Monkeys.\nTo promote the cultural development in children and youth of Tijuana, since 1996 the Tijuana Youth Symphony (SJT) has been promoted, which promotes education and musical training through instrument practices, music reading and public concerts. In addition, Tijuana has an opera season. There are also several musical festivals throughout the year, among which the Latin American Guitar Festival, Mainly Mozart Binacional, and the International Exhibition of contemporary dance \"Bodies in Transit\" stand out.\nTijuana is home to the Baja California Orchestra, one of the most prestigious and solid artistic institutions in northwestern Mexico, which was nominated for the Latin Grammy in the category of best classical album by the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Inc ., with the album Tango kills Danz\u00f3n kills Tango. This phonogram was distinguished as 'Best Classical Album of the year 2001' by the Mexican Union of Theater and Music Chroniclers. Currently, it maintains an annual season, offering symphonic and chamber music concerts in the most important forums of Tijuana and Baja California.\nAlready in the new century, many local bands have emerged, from all musical genres, some of them staying with local and national recognition. Highlights Nosis, High Slogan, Go Future, Ramona, The Children of the Saint, Among Deserts, Ziruela, Palos Verdes, Edwin, among others. Each of them have contributed and tried to revive the musical talent for which Tijuana has always been characterized.\nMusical clubs along the Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area and others often cater to a diverse range of tastes by offering nightly variations on musical fare, such as new wave music one night, and punk rock bands on the next. Some European metal bands whose members cannot perform in the United States due to prior felony convictions in their own countries play music festivals in Tijuana for fans from both Mexico and the United States.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city is home to the Tijuana Zonkeys professional basketball team of the CIBACOPA basketball league. The team is composed mostly of players from Mexico and plays from February to July in the Municipal Auditorium.\nThe city has a strong tradition of association football, Club Tijuana began playing in the Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n on the 2011/12 season, winning the 2012 Apertura title. They play their matches at the Estadio Caliente, a new 33,000 seat stadium. The team's mascot is the Xoloitzcuintle, a famous Mexican hairless dog.\nTijuana also has a long history of producing many world champion professional boxers, such as Antonio Margarito and Erik Morales.\n\n\n=== Stadiums ===\nEstadio Caliente\n\nThe stadium is the Estadio Caliente, match venue for Club Tijuana, a Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n football team. It is located in the Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Baja California (Mexico). Caliente Homes Stadium, is a multi-purpose center in Tijuana. It is mainly used for football matches, has a seating capacity of 21,000 spectators.  Opened in June 2008, according to the work schedule. It was a significant reason for Tijuana Club was promoted to the M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n; FEMEXFUT requires participating teams should have a stadium with a seating capacity of over 15,000. It is at this stage the U-17 FIBA Americas Championship 2009 was held bound for Nigeria. Was introduced in M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n during the Apertura 2011 tournament of the Mexican Football Federation.Estadio Chevron\n\nThe Chevron Stadium  is the home of the Toros de Tijuana. It opened in 1977 and housed the Colts missing Tijuana Mexican Pacific League. Subsequently, the stadium was used for football matches. For 2004, professional baseball returned, now with a franchise LMB under the name of Toros de Tijuana, which, the following year, changed its name to Colts as it had been known previously. At first the facility was called Cerro Colorado Stadium, due to its location at the foot of the hill of that name. With the return of baseball, chain supermarkets Calimax bought the naming rights to the stadium.  In 2004, the first season of Toros, the fans filled the stadium for most matches.  On April 4, 2013, the stadium was remodeled, marking the beginning of a new era for Toros de Tijuana.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\n\n\n==== Water ====\nThe Tijuana State Commission of Public Services (CESPT) supplies the city with its water, while the city receives its electricity from La Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE).\nIn 2019, due to extremely low water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir, CESPT began a city-wide water rationing scheme. This rationing scheme would divide Tijuana and nearby Rosarito into 5 zones. Each zone would be cut-off from the water supply on a rotating schedule of 4 days with water and 1 day without water. This scheme was expected to last for at least 2 months until the water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir were improved.\n\n\n==== Wastewater ====\nThe International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) developed, as a joint project of the USA and Mexico in the mid-1980s following substantial environmental studies, treats 25 million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Tijuana River; directly pumped across the border from the central collection point in Mexico. When the river is flowing, the diversion system of the plant begins operating and diverts up to about 12-13mgd to the IWTP. The total amount of water being diverted must not exceed 25 mgd, based on a monthly average decided upon by permit conditions, although the IWTP can treat sustained flows up to 45mgd daily and peaks of 70mgd for a short period. The diversion system regularly sends approximately six to eight million gallons of water daily to the IWTP. The plant is currently being upgraded to include a secondary treatment facility.\nThe city also four to five decentralize units that are part of the Tijuana/Rosarito Potable Water and Wastewater Master Plan. This plan was required as part of Public Law 106-457, put into order November 7, 2000, which was written to allow the Bajagua project to move forward. The master plan was a binational collaborative effort by EPA and CESPT and addressed San Diego-Tijuana's needs for the next 20 years. The plants are intended to treat approximately 5mgd each, to tertiary levels and provide the reclaimed water to the surrounding areas for agriculture, industry etc. There are several issues that they are facing: no infrastructure to convey the reclaimed water to customers and inadequate groundwater recharge infrastructure.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications ====\nTijuana's telephonic system operates under area code 664, but it is not the same area code 664 that is part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) because Mexico is not one of the countries represented in the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) where the country code is 1. So, to dial a phone number from San Diego to Tijuana requires an international access code and Mexico's Country Code, 52, before dialing the area code and the number.  It is similar for anyone calling from Tijuana to the United States.\nTelephonic landlines in Tijuana are provided by the company Telnor; other companies include Axtel, Izzi Telecom and Alestra. Popular cell phone carriers in the city-region include Movistar, Telcel, and AT&T Mexico. Many U.S. carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile offer free roaming in Mexico and it is possible to connect to U.S. based cell phone towers in many northern parts of the city. Cell phones also have historic usage in Tijuana as the first cellular call in Mexico was made in Tijuana in 1989.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nTijuana is a major gateway to the interior of Mexico to which it is connected by air and road directly, and by sea via the ports of Ensenada and San Diego. Within Tijuana there are freeways and other roads, and buses, but no passenger rail.\nLocal public transportation in Tijuana is run by semiprivate companies, and has one of the most complex, or perhaps unorganized networks.\n\n\n==== Air ====\nThe Tijuana International Airport (General Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez IA) is the city's main airport, one of the busiest in Mexico, and serves eleven airlines with destinations across Mexico and Shanghai, China. Tijuana Airport is also a second main airport for the San Diego area for passengers heading south into Mexico and Latin America, who may use the airport's Cross Border Xpress terminal located on the U.S. side of the border in Otay Mesa and connected to the rest of the airport on the Mexican side by a pedestrian toll bridge. U.S. and Canadian destinations can be reached via the San Diego International Airport, located about 35 kilometers (22 mi) north of the international border.\n\n\n==== Road ====\nTwo important Mexican federal highway corridors start in Tijuana, one of them is Fed 1, which runs south through the Baja California Peninsula through Rosarito Beach, Baja Mar, and Ensenada before ending in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. From Tijuana to Ensenada, most travelers take Fed 1D (scenic road), a four-lane, limited access toll road that runs by the coast starting at Playas de Tijuana. Fed 2 runs east for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) near the international border, as far as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua.\nWithin the metropolitan area the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 freeway connecte Mesa de Otay in the northeast of the city with Rosarito Beach in the southwest.\nJust north of the San Ysidro border crossing, Interstate 5 and Interstate 805 head northbound to San Diego and beyond. From the Otay Mesa border crossing, Interstate 905 takes drivers west to connect with both I-805 and I-5.\n\n\n==== Intercity buses ====\nThe city's main bus station is in its eastern borough. A small terminal downtown serves a few Mexican bus lines, and U.S.-based Greyhound Lines and Crucero USA. Another bus station near the border provides frequent service to Ensenada, and other major cities\u2014including Mazatl\u00e1n, Culiac\u00e1n, Hermosillo, and Guadalajara. Major bus lines operating in Tijuana include Azul y Blanco de Magallanes (Blue & White) and Transporte Efectivo Express de Tijuana \u2013 TEEXTI; modernizing system originally intended to phase out the other lines that partially introduced but ceased and merged with Azul y Blanco.\n\n\n==== Local buses ====\nIn 2006, Tijuana underwent a major overhaul of its existing system of guayines, or shared fixed-route station wagons, forcing the replacement of the guayines with new models of vans, serving as fixed-route taxis. Major transit hubs include Centro (Downtown Tijuana), Otay, Soler, and the Cinco y Diez avenues. Taxi lines operating in the city include Free Taxis, those that do not maintain a specific route; Economic Taxis; Diamond Taxis \u2013 black or yellow cabs; and regular taxis maintaining a set route. There are as many bus lines and routes as fixed-route taxi ones or calafias, and new routes for buses, taxis or calafias are frequently created, due to high demand of public transportation. Public transportation service is inexpensive, with bus tickets at maximum, USD $0.75. Fixed-route taxis are somewhat more expensive, depending on the taxi route, reaching USD $2.00. Bus, taxi and calafia lines and routes are distinguished from one another by their vehicles colors.\n\n\n==== Bus rapid transit ====\n\nA bus rapid transit system SITT operates one route from Downtown Tijuana and Garita Puerto Mexico near the San Ysidro Port of Entry, southeasterly along the Tijuana River to Terminal Insurgentes in the southeast of the city. It is part of a planned system of main and feeder lines to replace other buses and minibuses.\n\n\n==== Light rail ====\nPreviously there have been plans for a light rail service, for example in January 2009, the City Council and the Ministry of Communications and Transportation announced such a system along the Tijuana River, however so far nothing has come of these plans.There is, however, a light rail connection to downtown San Diego and beyond, starting immediately north of the San Ysidro Port of Entry to the U.S. at the San Ysidro Transit Center, where municipal buses also operate.\n\n\n==== Ride share ====\nRide share services Uber and DiDi operate throughout Tijuana and surrounding cities.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nTijuana has multiple sister cities and twin towns. These relations have been formalized by a variety of organizations as well as municipal governments. Currently twinned with the City of Tijuana are:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n Mexico portal\nTijuana Cartel\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nKun, Josh, and Fiamma Montezemolo, eds.

          "It is a church. Some might be surprised that in an officially secular country like Mexico most people are very devout. At all times you will find young and old, male and female locals here praying. No special arts or architecture here, this is a place of worship, not a museum.",
          "Stopped by the Cathedral while visiting Tijuana. Noticed the Clock Bell Towers with the Tijuana Arch from the pedestrian bridge at the border and decided to see it. It was interesting and a little different. The outside looks better than the inside which looks sort of",
          "Well kept building in and out in the heart of down town Tijuana , Mexico they have a few daily mass schedules .",
          "This Catedral De Nuestra Senora De Guadalupe in Centro Tijuana or Downtown for the Gringo's. Is a Tijuana Landmark and can be seen from quite a distance.",
          "While in Tijuana I walked the few blocks from Revolution over to the Church. It is in an older part of town, but on a weekday there were many people around and I never felt unsafe. The church is very nice both outside and inside. The stained glass windows were worth seeing. You",
          "We visited the church this morning and happened to catch the last half of a mass. The stained glass windows are lovely and the main Guadalupe decor above the altar is great. It was obviously a local, well used church and on a rainy Tuesday morning in January there were no",
          "Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe Cathedral is not far from Avenida Revolucion, so you might want to visit, now you\u00b4re near by. It\u00b4s nicer outside than inside and there is a lot of life going on at the small plaza in fron of the Cathedral. It\u00b4s a fairly new church.",
          "It's a very nice church. Upon entering a group of teenagers were offering candles and little Guadalupe necklaces. My two kids (3 and 1) were very impressed with inside of the church. Loved it!",
          "Is a Tijuana most! Is in downtown Tijuana in second street.. If you visit here don't forget to pass to the Popo market..",
          "It's a church that's in a bad part of town. I'm sure back in the day it was in its glory days but it is nothing to see now. It's the main church in Tijuana with all kinds of vendors trying to sell cheap trinkets. I'm sure Jesus would approve.",
          "A beautiful historical church located in downtown Tijuana (Centro). I always enjoy the historical significance of landmarks such as this beautiful cathedral.",
          "But i find it sad that one of the nicest buildings in centro or downtown tj is a Catholic church. Couldnt that money jave been better used to sever the people of tj instead.",
          "I don't like to belittle religious sites and don't mean to say that a trip to a cathedral is ever bad, but it is situated in a bad area and outside it is surrounded by street vendors who sell cheap tokens. It seemed kind of disgraceful.",
          "I've wandered in here a few times over the years, usually when we come to skate at the skatepark built behind some apartments across the street. ask a local who looks like they might no whats up, and they might direct u to the gate where the park is, where admittance can be had",
          "La Catedral de Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe is a catholic church has been in TJ for more then 50 yrs. It's location is in the heart of TJ's down town. The inside it's very beautiful; it's capacity about 400 people easy. My mom use to take me when I was a young child. I remember"

        "wiki": "Tijuana (US:  tee-(H)WAH-n\u0259, Spanish: [ti\u02c8xwana] (listen)) is the largest city of both Baja California State and the Baja California Peninsula. It is part of the San Diego\u2013Tijuana transborder urban agglomeration and the larger Southern California megalopolis. As the 6th-largest city in Mexico and center of the 6th-largest metro area in Mexico, Tijuana exerts a strong influence in education and politics \u2013 across Mexico, in transportation, culture and art \u2013  across all three Californias (the U.S. state of California, Baja California and Baja California Sur), and in manufacturing and as a migration hub \u2013 across the North American continent. Currently one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in Mexico, Tijuana maintains GaWC 'sufficiency city' status. As of 2015, the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,641,570.Tijuana is located on the Pacific coast of Baja California, and is the municipal seat and the cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality (Mexican states are divided into municipalities, rather than counties as in the U.S.). Tijuana covers 70% of the territory of the municipality and contains 80% of its population. A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent, the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies. In the early 21st century,  Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America. Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca. The city is the most visited border city in the world; sharing a border of about 24 km (15 mi) with its sister city San Diego. More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year. This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the fourth busiest land-border crossing in the world. It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone.Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico.  According to the 2015 census, the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico, with a population of 1,840,710, but rankings vary, the city (locality) itself was 6th largest and the municipality (administrative) 3rd largest nationally.  The international metropolitan region was estimated at about 5,158,459 in 2016, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region, 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas, and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico.  Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego.\nTijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias. As the American occupation of the Mexican capital ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Tijuana's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure. The city was founded on July 11, 1889 as urban development began. Often known by its supposed initials, T.J., and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico, the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe city's name comes from the rancho that Santiago Arg\u00fcello Moraga established in 1829 on his Mexican land grant, naming it Rancho T\u00eda Juana.The first Spanish mission call the settlement variously as La T\u00eda Juana, Tiguana, Tiuana, Tiwana, Tijuan, Ticuan, as well as Tijuana. While the Mexican city standardized to Tijuana, the American term for both the river and a U.S. settlement which is now part of San Ysidro remained T\u00eda Juana until the mid-20th century.\nThe commonly accepted theory among historians is that T\u00eda Juana, as Arg\u00fcello named his rancho, is derived from the word Tiwan (\"by the sea\") in the language of the Kumeyaay\u2014the original aboriginal inhabitants of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Urban legend, however, states that T\u00eda Juana, which means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, was a real person whose inn provided food and lodging to travelers. There is however no record of such an inn; in fact the first building in the area was built by Arg\u00fcello in any case, after naming his ranch Rancho T\u00eda Juana.\n\n\n=== Nicknames ===\nIn Southern California, Tijuana is often referred to as TJ or T.J. Baja Californians have adopted this pronunciation as Tiyei. In Spanish the demonym for someone from Tijuana is Tijuanense, while in English the demonym is Tijuanan. A very common slang term used for a person from Tijuana is Tijuanero.The nickname Tijuas is increasingly popular among residents and visitors alike. Due to a recent increase in violence in the city, a new term is developing. The phrase Yo Tijuaneo, \u00bfy t\u00fa? translates to I Tijuanate, and you?. This term comes from a new popular local verb Tijuanear meaning to Tijuana, describing the cosmopolitan aspects of living in the city and frequently crossing the border.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe land was originally inhabited by the Kumeyaay, a tribe of Yuman-speaking hunter-gatherers. Europeans arrived in 1542, when the explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo toured the coastline of the area, which Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno mapped in 1602. In 1769, Juan Cresp\u00ed documented more details about the area that was later called the Valley of Tijuana. Jun\u00edpero Serra founded the first mission of Alta California in nearby San Diego.\nFurther settlement took place near the end of the mission era when Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda, governor of the Baja California and Alta California, awarded a large land grant to Santiago Arg\u00fcello in 1829. This large cattle ranch, Rancho T\u00eda Juana, covered 100 km2 (40 sq mi). Although \"Tia Juana\" means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, the name was actually an adaptation of the word 'Tihuan' or 'Tiju\u00e1n' in the Kumeyaay language, the name of a nearby Kumeyaay settlement and whose meaning is disputed.In 1848, as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War with the United States, Mexico lost all of Alta California. The majority of the 1,000 Hispanic families living in Alta California stayed there, though some moved south to remain inside Mexico. Because of this Tijuana gained a different purpose on the international border. The area had been populated by ranchers, but Tijuana developed a new social economic structure. These were farming and livestock grazing, plus as a transit area for prospectors.\n\n\n=== 1889\u20131915: Town established ===\nUrban settlement began in 1889, when descendants of Santiago Arg\u00fcello and August\u00edn Olvera entered an agreement to begin developing the city of Tijuana. The date of the agreement, July 11, 1889, is recognized as the founding of the city. Tijuana saw its future in tourism from the beginning. From the late 19th century to the first few decades of the 20th century, the city attracted large numbers of Californians coming for trade and entertainment. The California land boom of the 1880s led to the first big wave of tourists, who were called \"excursionists\" and came looking for echoes of the famous novel \"Ramona\" by Helen Hunt Jackson.\nIn 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, revolutionaries claiming loyalty to Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n took over the city for shortly over a month. Federal troops then arrived. Assisted by the \"defensores de Tijuana\", they routed the revolutionaries, who fled north and were promptly arrested by the United States Army.\nThe Panama-California Exposition of 1915 brought many visitors to the nearby California city of San Diego. Tijuana attracted these tourists with a Feria T\u00edpica Mexicana \u2013 Typical Mexican Fair. This included curio shops, regional food, thermal baths, horse racing and boxing.\n\n\n=== 1916\u20131935: Gambling and drinking destination ===\nThe first professional race track opened in January 1916, just south of the border gate. It was almost immediately destroyed by the great \"Hatfield rainmaker\" flood of 1916. Rebuilt in the general area, it ran horse races until the new Agua Caliente track opened in 1929, several miles south and across the river on higher ground.\nLegal drinking and gambling attracted U.S nationals in the 1920s during Prohibition. The Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area became the city's tourist center, with casinos and the Hotel Caesar's, birthplace of the Caesar salad.\nIn 1925, the city by presidential decree changed his name to   ciudad Zaragoza, but its name reverted to Tijuana in 1929.\nIn 1928, the Agua Caliente Touristic Complex was opened, including hotel, spa, dog-track, private airport, golf course and gambling casino. A year later, the new Agua Caliente Racetrack joined the complex. During the eight years it operated, the Agua Caliente hotel, casino and spa achieved a near mythical status, with Hollywood stars and gangsters flying in and playing. Rita Hayworth was discovered there. Musical nightclub productions were broadcast over the radio. A singer known as \"la Faraona\" got shot in a love-triangle and gave birth to the myth of a beautiful lady ghost. Remnants of the Agua Caliente casino can be seen in the outdoor swimming pool and the \"minarete\" (actually a former incinerator chimney) nearby the southern end of Avenida Sanchez Taboada, on the grounds of what is now the Lazaro Cardenas educational complex.\n\n\n=== 1935\u20131965: Tourism broadens ===\nIn 1935, President C\u00e1rdenas decreed an end to gambling and casinos in Baja California, and the Agua Caliente complex faltered, then closed. In 1939, it was reopened as a junior high school (now, Preparatoria L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas). The buildings themselves were torn down in the 1970s and replaced by modern scholastic architecture.\nWith increased tourism and a large number of Mexican citizens relocating to Tijuana, the city's population grew from 21,971 to 65,364 between 1940 and 1950.\n\nWith the decline of nightlife and tourism in the 1950s, the city restructured its tourist industry, by promoting a more family-oriented scene. Tijuana developed a greater variety of attractions and activities to offer its visitors.\n\n\n=== 1965\u20132001: The city matures ===\nIn 1965 the Mexican federal government launched the Border Industrialization Program to attract foreign investment. Tijuana and other border cities became attractive for foreign companies to open maquiladoras (factories), and the Tijuana economy started to diversify. Manufacturing jobs attracted workers from other parts of Mexico and the city's population grew from less than half a million in 1980 to almost 1 million in 1985.\nIn 1972, work began on the first concrete channeling of the Tijuana River; previously the river would flood across a wide plain east and southeast of downtown, inundating an area of wood, cardboard and metal shacks called Cartolandia (\u201cPaperland\u201d).  The project removed the shacks and added 1.8 million sq. m. of usable land, on which the Zona R\u00edo was built. With the 1981 opening of the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana mall and the 1982 Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT), Zona R\u00edo became the new commercial center of a modern Tijuana, and with its new boulevards with monument-filled glorietas (roundabouts), reminiscent of the grand Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, the city created the new image and allure of a modern, large city, rather than just a border town focused on tourism and vice.In 1994, PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana while making an appearance in the plaza of Lomas Taurinas, a neighborhood nestled in a valley near Centro. The shooter was caught and imprisoned, but doubts remain about who the mastermind might have been.\n\n\n=== 2001\u20132011: Violence and decline of US tourism ===\nAfter 9/11, tighter US border controls resulted in hours-long waits to return to the US. The number of US visitors dropped sharply due to this factor, as well as subsequent drug violence.Around 2008, thousands of Tijuana's elite bought houses in and moved to Bonita and Eastlake in Chula Vista, California to escape violence, kidnapping and other crimes taking place during that period. An article in The Los Angeles Times reported that the emigration to San Diego County has transformed the demographic and cultural character of some cities to a degree.\n\n\n=== 2011\u2013present: Tijuana strengthens ===\nIn recent years, Tijuana has become an important city of commerce and migration for Mexico and US. In spite of the violence and border crossing issues, the city has received a large number of tourists from US, China, Japan and the south of Mexico. Thanks to the realization of cultural and business festivals, the city has improved its image before the world, standing out as a competitive city for investment. Currently, the commercial and business sector is committed to the boom in the gastronomic industry, craft beer, entertainment and real estate, as well as medical tourism, to attract visitors and investors.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTijuana is the westernmost city in Mexico, and consequently in Latin America, and the second largest city of northern Mexico. Located about 210 kilometers (130 mi) west of the state capital, Mexicali, the city is bordered to the north by the cities of Imperial Beach, and the San Diego neighborhoods of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, California. To the southwest of the city is Rosarito Beach, while to the south is unincorporated territory of Tijuana Municipality. The city is nestled among hills, canyons, and gullies. The central part of the city lies in a valley through which flows the channeled Tijuana River.\nHousing development in the Tijuana Hills has led to eradication of many seasonal mountain streams. This lack of natural drainage makes places within the city vulnerable to landslides during the rainy season. The varied terrain of Tijuana gives the city elevation extremes that range from sea level to 790 meters (2,590 ft).\nTijuana is noted for its rough terrain, which includes many canyons, steep hills, and mesas. Among noted canyons in Tijuana are Canyon K and Canyon Johnson. Large Tijuana hills include Red Hill (Cerro Colorado) and Hill of the Bees (Cerro de las Abejas) in the eastern part of the city.\nThe city is located near the terminus of the Tijuana River and within the Tijuana River Basin. The Tijuana River is an intermittent river, 195 km (121 mi) long, on the Pacific coast of northern Baja California in Mexico and Southern California in the United States. It drains an arid area along the California\u2013Baja California border, flowing through Mexico for most of its course and then crossing the border for the last 8 km (5 mi) of its course where it forms an estuary that empties into the ocean. The river's lower reaches harbor the last undeveloped coastal wetlands in San Diego County, and some of the last in Southern California, amidst a highly urbanized environment at the southern city limits of Imperial Beach.\nAs downtown Tijuana was built at the bottom of the river valley, the district is subject to seasonal flooding created by drain-off from the Tijuana Hills. During this time, east-bound portions of the Via Rapida (east-west highway) may be blocked off by the Tijuana Police due to hazardous conditions.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city's skyscraper history is relatively recent. Some of the first highrise building complexes constructed in the city were the twin towers of Grand Hotel Tijuana. Tijuana experienced a building boom that was brought to a halt by the Great Recession. Among buildings that succumbed to the time period was the Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico that would have been located in Playas and reached 98 m (322 ft). Currently the tallest building, and soon to be the largest complex in footage, New City Residential reaches 102 m (335 ft). Overall, the city maintains 33 completed structures with other proposed and under-construction skyscrapers.\n\nThe Tijuana skyline is the fifth largest skyline in Mexico and is located in the Zona Rio and to a smaller extent, Playas de Tijuana. In the Zona Rio the buildings are concentrated on the Tijuana River, lined parallel to the river; and on the edges of the Tijuana Country Club. In Playas the high rises are currently focused on the coast. Recent construction on high rises has begun in the aforementioned areas, as buildings such as New City Residential and Grand Hotel Tijuana have been developed and taken prominent places in the skyline as the tallest buildings. From Tijuana's skyline the San Diego skyline can also be seen, although the reverse is mostly not true on account of the high hills surrounding central Tijuana.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Tijuana is divided into eight administrative boroughs, or Delegaciones. The Tijuana metropolitan area occupies all of borough seats. The boroughs are in turn divided into colonias or ejidos. These boroughs offer administrative services such as urban planning, civil registry, inspection, verification, public works and community development and are served by a delegado.\n\nCentro \u2014 \"Delegaci\u00f3n Centro\" includes the old downtown (Zona Centro), new business district (Zona R\u00edo), red light district (Zona Norte), and other adjacent neighborhoods (\"zonas\"). This is the historical midpoint of Tijuana; the municipal palace is located here as well as most of the tourist zones, such as Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n and the business district. The Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT for CEntro CUltural de Tijuana) is located here as well as the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana, until recently the largest mall in the state, within the Zona Rio.\nCerro Colorado \u2014 The Cerro Colorado (\"Red Hill\") is located here and it is surrounded by houses. Because of its height many of the area's antennae for radio and television stations are located on its peak.\nLa Mesa \u2014 This is where the Morelos Park, the largest public park in the city, is located, as well as the retail and transit hub Cinco y Diez, Plaza Mundo Divertido, the new Macroplaza and the CETYS University.\nOtay Centenario \u2014 This borough was created in 2014 by merging Mesa de Otay and Centenario boroughs. In this borough sits the Tijuana International Airport.  The Tijuana campus of the Autonomous University of Baja California and the Technologico are also located here as well as many maquiladoras. This is the borough with the largest number of factories and maquiladoras. Its largest colony is Ciudad Industrial (\"Industrial City\"). Three of the city's most important streets, Boulevard Bellas Artes, Boulevard Industrial and Fed 2, are located here.  This delegacion contains the Otay Mesa entry to the United States and the Friendship Park (Parque de la amistad).\nPlayas de Tijuana \u2014 This is the westernmost borough of the city bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the United States border on the north. This is where the beaches of Tijuana are located (hence the name) and it is also one of the two exits to the south towards Rosarito and Ensenada.\nLa Presa \u2014 literally \"'the dam'\", this is the largest borough in size and the Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez Dam is located within its limits, hence its name. The new Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 and the Tijuana-Tecate freeways run through it.\nSan Antonio de los Buenos \u2014 This is mostly a residential area although it also has two industrial parks.\nSanchez Taboada \u2014 Like the previous borough this is mostly a residential area, but within its borders are located many \"maquiladoras\" specially at Pacific Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTijuana's climate is a semi-arid (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh), with about 231 mm (9.09 in) of annual precipitation, and generally mild to warm weather year-round. It has characteristics of the Mediterranean climate (Csa) found to the immediate north, with most of the annual precipitation falling in the winter, between the months of November and March.\n\nBetween November and March, storms originate from fronts entering off of the Pacific Ocean. January is the wettest month of the year for the city and during this time a periodic event, similar to June Gloom, is observed created by marine layer. January is the coolest month, during which temperatures average 13.6 \u00b0C (56.5 \u00b0F). In the city April signifies the end of winter and the start of Santa Ana winds. Though the daytime highs are generally around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), heat waves can reach up to 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F). The hottest months in the city are August and September, during which temperatures average 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Summers are by far the driest time of year since influences from the California Current and the North Pacific High suppress the formation of rainfall caused by the North American Monsoon. As in coastal Southern California, air pollution sometimes occurs during periods of temperature inversion, especially during summer and fall, but (unlike Mexico City) is seldom severe and in recent years has lessened due to cleaner car engines.Frost and snow are rare phenomena in the city as temperatures are usually well above freezing. Yet, in December 1967, snow fell in the city and in January 2007 feather light snow fell in the east of the city. However, excessive amounts of snow fall have never been recorded in the city. On February 14, 2008 a winter storm caused an unusual snowfall in the upper reaches of the hills of the city.\nThe record low temperature recorded in the city was \u22126 \u00b0C (21 \u00b0F), while the highest was 49 \u00b0C (120 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nTijuana has a diverse cosmopolitan population which includes migrants from other parts of Mexico and from all over the world. Tijuana has one of Mexico's largest Asian populations, predominantly consisting of Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese immigrants. Tijuana also has a large and rapidly growing population of United States citizens, mostly from Southern California.  Many Latin Americans, notably Cubans, and Guatemalans, have made Tijuana their home. The city also has many Lebanese, Italian, French, Spanish citizens. Recently, the city has received a large influx of Haitian immigrants.\n\nThe majority of Tijuana's migrant Mexican population hail from Sinaloa, Michoac\u00e1n, Jalisco, Oaxaca, and the Federal District. Because of the diversity of Mexico and the influx of immigrants from almost every region in the country, there are no accurate estimates on ethnicity or race of the current population. The heavy influx of immigrants to the city and municipality of Tijuana has led to job creation in the form of over 700 twin-plant (maquiladora) factories, which serve as the basis of employment for the majority of the working-class people in northern Mexico.  The high poverty level in Tijuana is attributed to the city's \"magnet status\" for people who have come from the poorer south of the nation and citizens from other nations seeking to escape from extreme poverty.  Tijuana holds a status that provides the possibility of employment as well as higher education and the dream of crossing the border.  Tijuana and Baja California in general have much stronger economies and higher incomes than other Mexican cities along the United States border, as well as more moderate weather.\nTijuana today is one of the fastest growing cities in Mexico with an average of 80,000 people moving to Tijuana yearly.  In terms of area, the city grows by approximately three hectares a day, mostly east and south as the city is mostly built out to the beach already with the exception of some canyons.  Along with settlements separated from Tijuana proper and other communities unimproved land, big business moves in providing supermarkets and retail to marginal areas, along with paved roads.  The city experiences the construction of 26,000 new settlers a year that has led to the unregulated, illegal squatter homes that takes place in the hills and valleys of ever expanding Tijuana, most of these areas are still without city services like sidewalks, paving, streetlights, and public transit. This is an ongoing process: as older and existing squatter areas are brought into the city services, more marginal areas become occupied by squatters.\nSquatter areas are home to displaced and uprooted people, among them the indigenous and poverty stricken, as well as migrants deported from the USA, many of whom are also without Mexican citizenship.  In recent years, working-class suburban housing estates have sprung up in the fringes to provide a sense of safety and land ownership.  These suburbs enable young families to isolate their families from the violence of the drug war and squatter areas.  These outlying communities tend to be much better equipped than their squatter counterparts.  Nevertheless, some remote areas are drug plantations for narcotics, and delinquency has spread to areas once considered safe havens.  These issues occasionally come to light in the newspapers.\nNational Population Council (CONAPO) data has estimated that by 2030, growth rates maintaining, the city will become the second largest in Mexico and anchor to the fourth largest metropolitan area in Mexico. The suburban sprawl observed in Tijuana leaves the downtown and beach areas relatively affluent.\n\nWhile the INEGI Census 2010 placed Tijuana's population at 1.3 million, only two percent more than in 2005 Census, Tijuana City Council estimates from 2010 place the population closer to two million, at 1.6 million. As funding for cities is based on the populace of the city, the Council worries about receiving adequate funds to provide for the needs of the city.  The population discrepancies may be explained by a few factors.  Shanty towns that have not been rasterized and an undercount, people having left Tijuana for United States, and people leaving Tijuana for the interior of Mexico due to the intensification of the drug war, and suburbanization outside city limits but still inside the municipality.  Tijuana, because of the dreams of border crossers, and its relatively higher wages compared to the rest of Mexico, naturally attracts immigrants.  Since an improvement in security since 2011, the population of Tijuana as reflected in the 2015 Mexican census is expected to return to its normal growth curve; the great reduction in violence should make the settlement of Tijuana an attractive option again versus fringe valleys, nevertheless exact figures from the census await.\nAccording to the Second Census of Population and Housing of the year 2010 conducted by the INEGI (National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics) the municipality of Tijuana has 1,559,683 inhabitants within 879 km2, the city or settlement of Tijuana only covers \u2154 of that area.  While the metropolitan area of Tijuana (1392 km2), composed of Tijuana Municipality and Rosarito Beach Municipality, has 1,751,302 inhabitants. Tecate Municipality, adjacent to Tijuana Municipality, has not yet been considered by the government as part of the metropolitan area.  However, there is great economic and cultural exchange between the cities regions though there are still expanses of rural land. As Tijuana grows, many of its suburbs have been built increasingly inland, and in the direction of Tecate; Valley of the Palms is a large planned city between the two.\nAs of 2005 the large majority of the city's population, 96%, adhere to the beliefs of Christianity. The denominations are further divided into followers of Catholicism \u2013 61% \u2013 and of Protestantism \u2013 35%.  While other beliefs occupying a 4% margin in the city include Taoism (among other Asian and European religions), atheism and agnosticism is also found.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nTijuana is the birthplace and base of the Tijuana Cartel.  From 2007 through 2010, Tijuana experienced an unusually high level of violent crime related to gang violence, in part derived from the Mexican drug war and human trafficking.  Homicides peaked in 2010, when 844 people were killed, compared with 355 in 2004 and 349 in the first eight months of 2011. Reportedly, the wave of violence resulted from a turf war as the administration of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n weakened the local Arellano F\u00e9lix cartel; violence slowed when the larger Sinaloa cartel took control.During peak years of violent crime in the city, gun battles between rival cartels, and between cartels and the police, erupted in public. In April 2008, police found 1,500 shell casings on various streets after one battle left 13 suspected drug traffickers dead. In 2009 and depending on the source, Tijuana Municipality experienced either 556 or 1,118 murders, mostly as a result of the drug war.There were 492 murders in 2013, a 48% increase in the homicide rate between 2012 and 2013. This was the highest number of murders since 2010. By the end of 2017, the number of murders in Tijuana increased to 1,744, which was almost double those in 2016.As of 2018, Tijuana had the highest per capita rate for homicides in the world at 138 murders per 100,000 people.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Region ===\n\nAt present the parties with greater presence in Tijuana are the National Action Party (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). The PAN has been the dominant party in the city for 20 years. Historically the PRI had been the dominant party in regional politics, until 1989 when the PAN began to dominate the city, until yet again, in 2004, PRI began regaining prominence and won the Mayor's Office.\nLess prominent parties also maintain relations with the dominant parties. These other parties, with less presence include the New Alliance Party (PANAL), Social Encounter Party (PES), and Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Allied with the PAN at the state and local level under the Alliance for Baja California are the Social Encounter Party (PES) and New Alliance Party (PANAL). Allied with the PRI at the state and local level under the \"Alliance for Better Living\" are the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) and Baja California State Party (PEBC).\n\n\n=== International ===\nTijuana's importance and rise to a global city has led to its recognition among countries worldwide. In addition to international cultural recognition, Tijuana has received political recognition and is a developing a political center currently host to eight consulates from European, Asian, and North American countries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\n\nTijuana is a large manufacturing center, and in addition to tourism, it serves as a cornerstone of the city economy. In the past decade alone, Tijuana became the medical device manufacture capital of the North American continent, surpassing previous leader Minneapolis - Saint Paul.The city's proximity to Southern California and its large, skilled, diverse, and relatively inexpensive workforce make it an attractive city for foreign companies looking to establish extensive industrial parks composed of assembly plants that are called maquiladoras, even more so than other cities in the US-Mexican border zone, taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to export products. At its peak, in 2001 Tijuana had roughly 820 of these 'maquiladoras'. Foreign and domestic companies employ thousands of employees in these plants, usually in assembly-related labor. Such jobs are not demanding but typically offer above average salaries for Mexico, with most maqiladoras jobs beginning at Mex$100 per day (about 5 US dollars, as of September 2016), significantly above the Mexican minimum wage of Mex$57.46 (about 3 US dollars, as of September 2016). Companies that have set up maquiladoras in Tijuana include Lanix, Hyundai, Sony, Vortec, BMW, Vizio, Toyota, Dell, Samsung, Kodak, Matsushita/Panasonic, GE, Nabisco, Ford, Microsoft, Cemex, Zonda, Philips, Pioneer, Airbus, Plantronics, Siemens Mexico, Jaguar, Pall Medical, Tara, Sanyo and Volkswagen. Many of the maquiladoras are located in the Otay Mesa and Florido sections of Tijuana.\nEconomic development has its central business district at Zona R\u00edo, which together, with the corridor along Blvd. Agua Caliente (the extension of Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n), contains the majority of the higher-end office space in the city.\n\n\n=== Tourist economy and entertainment ===\nTijuana also relies on tourism for a major part of its revenue. About 300,000 visitors cross by foot or car from the San Ysidro point of entry in the United States every day. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs, and shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are part of the draw for the city's tourists, many located within walking distance of the border. The city's tourist centers include Downtown Tijuana including the nightlife hot spots around La Sexta, Avenida Revolucion, souvenir shopping at the Mercado de Artesan\u00edas and Plaza Viva Tijuana, Tijuana's Cultural Center (CECUT) and neighboring Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana shopping center, and the city's best known vices, in the form of its legal Red Light District and gambling (Agua Caliente). Mexico's drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college aged Southern Californians who tend to stay on Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n.\nTijuana is also known for its red-light district Zona Norte (also referred to as La Coahuila after one of its main streets) with legal prostitution in strip clubs and on the street. The strip clubs are typically full-contact, meaning the dancers let patrons fondle them. Many dancers also sell their sexual services. In a 1999 estimation, there were 15,000 women engaged in prostitution in Tijuana outside of clubs and brothels.Tijuana has many pharmacies that target visitors from the United States, which sell some medicines without prescriptions and/or at much lower costs than in the U.S. Many medications still require a Mexican prescription, which can be obtained from adjacent doctors' offices. People filling up prescriptions for drugs classified in the US as Schedule II or Schedule III have found it more difficult to locate such medications, and the purchase of pseudoephedrine also has become restricted by Tijuana pharmacies, just as in the U.S. To fill a prescription in Tijuana for any drug covered by the US Controlled Substances Act  and legally bring it into the United States requires a prescription from the United States for re-import.  Americans can import up to a 90-day supply of non-controlled medications for personal use to the USA from Mexico and other countries.\nBusinesses such as auto detailing, medical and dental services and plastic surgery are heavily marketed, and are usually much less expensive than in the U.S.\nTijuana is headquarters for Mexico's largest gambling concern, Grupo Caliente, which operates the only casinos in the city, more than twenty branches.Tourists are sometimes robbed by municipal police.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nPlaza Rio Tijuana is a large regional mall anchored by Cin\u00e9polis, Sanborns, S\u00faper DAX and Sears.\nAll across the city, there are dozens of plazas comerciales, which may be strip malls or small enclosed or open-air centers, with a combination of any or all of the following anchors:\n\none of the 26 Tijuana branches of the small department store Coppel,\na supermarket or hypermarket,\na cin\u00e9polis or cinemex multicinema,\na branch of the electronics and motorcycle retailer ElektraAn important concentration of plazas is in the Cinco y Diez around an eponymous intersection, named for a former American-style five and dime store that was located there. It is also a major hub for public transit. Plaza Carrousel, with its namesake merry-go-round, is located here.\nCostco, Sam's Club, and Walmart each have multiple branches across the city.\nTraditional markets with vendors include the large Mercado Hidalgo in Zona R\u00edo, smaller neighborhood markets and the Mercado Municipal downtown.\nTijuana was the headquarters of 14-store Dorian's department store chain until its demise in 2009; most were converted to Sears stores.\n\n\n=== Culinary ===\nTijuana, along with the nearby Valle de Guadalupe, has recently become a culinary hotspot due to its Baja Med cuisine, including chefs such as Javier Plascencia, but also for its tacos, other street food, food trucks, coffee houses and artisanal beer.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTijuana is home to many private Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and High Schools as well as nationally high ranked colleges and universities. Notable primary and secondary schools include Metropolitan, Instituto M\u00e9xico, Instituto Cumbres, President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas School, Agua Caliente School Center High, Polit\u00e9cnico de Baja California(CLUB DE QU\u00cdMICA), Jos\u00e9 Fimbres Moreno School and the State High School, and Ignacio Ram\u00edrez School located in Cerro Colorado. These schools maintain recognition for their demands and high standards.\nTijuana maintains multiple higher education institutions. These include the Autonomous University of Baja California, Tijuana (UABC), Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Tijuana (ITT), Universidad Iberoamericana (UIA-Tijuana), CETYS Universidad, Universidad Xochicalco, and University of the Californias. Other colleges include Tijuana University Center, Tijuana University of Technology, Graduate Center of the Northwest, and the University of Professional Development. The city is the seat of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), an institution of scientific research and higher education, specializing in the study of the problems in the border region between Mexico and the United States. In August 2009, Metropolitan UABC opened in Valle de Las Palmas, in the Tijuana metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Culture and contemporary life ==\nMany foreigners travel to Tijuana to drink and dance, buy prescription drugs, purchase bootleg brand-name clothing, timepieces, and other personal accessories found globally, as well as manufactured and hand-crafted local curiosities. Locals and regular tourists avoid hassles by visiting the clubs at Plaza Fiesta or other areas of the Zona R\u00edo without the crowds, heavy marketing, and occasional tourist misbehavior or outright lawbreaking common on the Revoluci\u00f3n strip. However, Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n has been known for its proliferation of nightclub shows, primarily catering to casual tourists. While still an entertaining town with an enjoyable atmosphere, some locals and tourists feel it has lost an \"anything goes\" atmosphere, that was dangerous to locals, tourists, and the tourism industry.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nAs Tijuana matured from a tourist-oriented border town into one of Mexico's largest cities, the 1982 opening of the Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT) marked a milestone. CECUT's mission was to strengthening Tijuana's image, both to US visitors and to Mexicans, as a destination for culture and not only shopping and vice. The center includes an OMNIMAX cinema showing IMAX films, the Museum of the Californias, contemporary art exhibition halls, a restaurant, caf\u00e9, bookstore,  and other cultural facilities.\nLa Casa de la Cultura cultural center comprises a school, a theater, and a public library, and teaches dance, painting, music, plastic arts, photography and languages.\nOther cultural venues include the Instituto Municipal de Arte y Cultura (Municipal Institute of Art and Culture), the Tijuana Wax Museum, the Museo El Trompo (Trompo Museum), and El Foro, the former Jai Alai Palace, that is now a concert venue. Concerts are also held at the Estadio Caliente stadium, Hip\u00f3dromo Agua Caliente Racetrack, and at the \"Audiorama\" at the Museo El Trompo children's museum of science and technology.The Tijuana Country Club (Club Campestre de Tijuana) has many affluent members and a famous golf course and also functions as an entertainment and events venue. Tijuana also has a large Rotary Club.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\nParque Morelos has a small zoo and park space; Parque de la Amistad in Otay Centenario has a small pond, and a running and dirt-bike track. Parque Teniente Guerrero is a downtown park with a public library and weekend entertainment by clowns.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nTijuana's nightlife scene is one of the city's strongest attractions. The area surrounding \"La Sexta\", the intersection at Calle Sexta and Av. Revoluci\u00f3n, is now a major hub of new bars and dance clubs. Zona Rio, Tijuana's new Downtown, is home to some of the city's finest restaurants and bars. Another capstone of Tijuana's entertainment offerings is its adult nightlife industry, which includes the city's red light district as well as less conspicuous adult entertainment venues.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nTijuana also has a very active and independent artist community whose internationally recognized work has earned Tijuana the title of \"one of the most important new cultural meccas\", according to Newsweek, an exhibition of Tijuana's current art scene, is being curated by the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and is traveling across the USA in 2006 and 2007. Art collectives like Bulbo and film production like Palenque Filmaciones explore the use of film like the award-winning Tijuana Makes Me Happy, media like television bulbo TV and print \"bulbo PRESS\", to show different realities of Tijuana out of Mexico. In 2004, Tijuana earned international acclaim for an art exhibition displayed on the cement banks of the Tijuana River and along the Mexico/U.S. border fence in Otay Mesa.\nGraffiti is widespread in Tijuana. They can range from free-hand writing in spray can and marker form, often carrying social or sexual commentary in English or Spanish, pictures in wheatpaste and stencils, consisting of stenciled renderings of personalities crucial to Hispanic culture from past and present eras, such as television news announcers or stars, but also extending to images of artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed. Graffiti in Tijuana may seem at first to consist largely of simplistic tags and thus not as technically evolved, colorful, or accepted in the mainstream as the \"pieces\" of graffiti scenes of the United States, Europe, or Japan, but large, colorful graffiti murals adorn walls from both native Tijuanan artists as well as visiting graffiti writers, especially from California. The Tijuanan art pieces show as much prowess and skill as those made by their more renowned U.S. counterparts, although illicit graffiti are strongly discouraged by the Tijuana government, as in other major metropolitan areas.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nSince the decade of the 1920s, Tijuana has excelled in the musical field, thanks to the first groups of ranchera music that began to set the tourist establishments in the area with the visit of foreigners, including the former Casino Agua Caliente.\nRock music was very popular and popular among young people in the mid-50s, leaving the ranch rhythm aside years ago. Another event that added the arrival of Rock to Tijuana was the visit of the African-American pianist and guitarist, Gene Ross, who came to play at the Convoy Club on Revolution Avenue. The presence of this artist was the beginning of the rock scene in the region that marked a new style in the country.54 Some groupings of the nascent Mexican rock began, an example of which was \"The Tijuana Five\", who made some covers in Spanish of Anglo-Saxon successes.\nJavier Batiz founded in 1957 he founded a group called \"Los TJ's\" with which he collected musical influences that were received in the Mexican border cities of black music, blues and R&B from people like T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin 'Wolf, James Brown, among others. Later he would start his solo career in the rest of the country and participating in some bands in Mexico City.\nDuring the 60s, the American trumpeter Herb Alpert, in a visit to the bullfights made in the old Bullfight, found musical inspiration so after the recording of his single \"The Lonely Bull\", which was a radio hit in 1962. With the success, he decided to make a casting and formed \"The Tijuana Brass\", with whom he toured and had a presentation on television. It was a musical collaboration with artists from Los Angeles, with style called \"Tijuana Marimba\u00b4s Brass\". The band was dissolved in 1969 but they continued with some presentations under the name of T.J.B. 55\nAt the end of the 60s and during the 70s, rock and roll still had great acceptance in the public. In those years bands such as \"The Moonlights\" had national and international recognition, who achieved successes such as \"Tijuana Funky\" or \"Are you\"; the \"Rockin Devils\", recognized for their Spanish cover of \"Bule Bule\", which achieved international success. The Roble Cinema, La Caba\u00f1a club and Flamingos club, would be some of the main stages of the decade for musical performances in the city.56\nIn the 70s, rock groups and musicians experienced government rejection and censorship for the lyrics of the songs. Romantic music took a boom and from there came bands like \"The Battle of Tijuana\", \"Los Solitarios\", \"Los Terr\u00edcolas\", \"Old Memories\", \"Tito Pantoja and his friends\", \"Ritmo 7\", \"Los Old Friends \",\" California Brass \"and \"Los Corazones Solitarios\", among others.\nIn the late 80s, Antonio De Carlo, was recognized as a revelation artist at the OTI Festival, having a successful career during the 90s, with songs such as \"In A Thousand Pieces\", \"A Pecho Discovery\", \"Revolution\" and \"Like It Hurts \". Lynda also gained national relevance in pop, achieving hits in songs like \"Lost Heart\", \"Tell\", \"A Thousand for an Hour\", among others.\nDespite the downturn in rock artists for some years, in the 90s Tijuana No! emerged, returning a bit of the genre to the city. They also incorporated ska, punk and reggae. \"No\" would be the first album released, from which successes like \"Pobre de ti\", which had Julieta Venegas as a vocalist, would emerge. Later the singer began her solo career already in the 00s of the 21st century. Her musical career reached the recording of six studio albums, and she won two Grammys, six Latin Grammys, six MTV Latin America and two Latin Music Billboard.\nThe city continued to be a hotbed of important rock bands, among them, especially at the international level, Specimen, other bands and prominent artists could be Ohtli, Nona Delichas, Canseco, Sonoro 2 and Headlongs. Electronic music boomed in the 90s, Murcof and the Nortec Collective, entered the scene and began to gain worldwide recognition for merging electronic music with northern and band music. This group was enriched with the visual contribution of designers and videographers who, under the same concept, provided images to this musical proposal.\nRegarding Mexican regional music, some groups of the northern genre were emerging, highlighting Los Tucanes de Tijuana, who since the 80s began their musical career until popularizing songs such as \"La Chona\", \"El Tucanazo\", \"La Chica Sexy\", among others. The Agua Caliente Band, Explosi\u00f3n Norte\u00f1a, among others, would be a new generation of Mexican popular music artists.\nAmong other things, Tijuana has been the inspiration for the birthplace of Nortec music style and Ruidoson, resulting in a very large and active electronic music scene where groups and artists like Los Macuanos, Maria y Jose, Siberium, Hidhawk and Harpocrates emerged. Tijuana also enjoys a large base of support in many other musical scenes such as mexican hip hop, reggae, hardcore, punk, black metal and house music. Famous musicians are from Tijuana including the pop-rock singer-songwriter Lynda Thomas and Vanessa Zamora and international indie punk bands like Delux and Los Kung-Fu Monkeys.\nTo promote the cultural development in children and youth of Tijuana, since 1996 the Tijuana Youth Symphony (SJT) has been promoted, which promotes education and musical training through instrument practices, music reading and public concerts. In addition, Tijuana has an opera season. There are also several musical festivals throughout the year, among which the Latin American Guitar Festival, Mainly Mozart Binacional, and the International Exhibition of contemporary dance \"Bodies in Transit\" stand out.\nTijuana is home to the Baja California Orchestra, one of the most prestigious and solid artistic institutions in northwestern Mexico, which was nominated for the Latin Grammy in the category of best classical album by the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Inc ., with the album Tango kills Danz\u00f3n kills Tango. This phonogram was distinguished as 'Best Classical Album of the year 2001' by the Mexican Union of Theater and Music Chroniclers. Currently, it maintains an annual season, offering symphonic and chamber music concerts in the most important forums of Tijuana and Baja California.\nAlready in the new century, many local bands have emerged, from all musical genres, some of them staying with local and national recognition. Highlights Nosis, High Slogan, Go Future, Ramona, The Children of the Saint, Among Deserts, Ziruela, Palos Verdes, Edwin, among others. Each of them have contributed and tried to revive the musical talent for which Tijuana has always been characterized.\nMusical clubs along the Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area and others often cater to a diverse range of tastes by offering nightly variations on musical fare, such as new wave music one night, and punk rock bands on the next. Some European metal bands whose members cannot perform in the United States due to prior felony convictions in their own countries play music festivals in Tijuana for fans from both Mexico and the United States.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city is home to the Tijuana Zonkeys professional basketball team of the CIBACOPA basketball league. The team is composed mostly of players from Mexico and plays from February to July in the Municipal Auditorium.\nThe city has a strong tradition of association football, Club Tijuana began playing in the Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n on the 2011/12 season, winning the 2012 Apertura title. They play their matches at the Estadio Caliente, a new 33,000 seat stadium. The team's mascot is the Xoloitzcuintle, a famous Mexican hairless dog.\nTijuana also has a long history of producing many world champion professional boxers, such as Antonio Margarito and Erik Morales.\n\n\n=== Stadiums ===\nEstadio Caliente\n\nThe stadium is the Estadio Caliente, match venue for Club Tijuana, a Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n football team. It is located in the Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Baja California (Mexico). Caliente Homes Stadium, is a multi-purpose center in Tijuana. It is mainly used for football matches, has a seating capacity of 21,000 spectators.  Opened in June 2008, according to the work schedule. It was a significant reason for Tijuana Club was promoted to the M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n; FEMEXFUT requires participating teams should have a stadium with a seating capacity of over 15,000. It is at this stage the U-17 FIBA Americas Championship 2009 was held bound for Nigeria. Was introduced in M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n during the Apertura 2011 tournament of the Mexican Football Federation.Estadio Chevron\n\nThe Chevron Stadium  is the home of the Toros de Tijuana. It opened in 1977 and housed the Colts missing Tijuana Mexican Pacific League. Subsequently, the stadium was used for football matches. For 2004, professional baseball returned, now with a franchise LMB under the name of Toros de Tijuana, which, the following year, changed its name to Colts as it had been known previously. At first the facility was called Cerro Colorado Stadium, due to its location at the foot of the hill of that name. With the return of baseball, chain supermarkets Calimax bought the naming rights to the stadium.  In 2004, the first season of Toros, the fans filled the stadium for most matches.  On April 4, 2013, the stadium was remodeled, marking the beginning of a new era for Toros de Tijuana.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\n\n\n==== Water ====\nThe Tijuana State Commission of Public Services (CESPT) supplies the city with its water, while the city receives its electricity from La Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE).\nIn 2019, due to extremely low water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir, CESPT began a city-wide water rationing scheme. This rationing scheme would divide Tijuana and nearby Rosarito into 5 zones. Each zone would be cut-off from the water supply on a rotating schedule of 4 days with water and 1 day without water. This scheme was expected to last for at least 2 months until the water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir were improved.\n\n\n==== Wastewater ====\nThe International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) developed, as a joint project of the USA and Mexico in the mid-1980s following substantial environmental studies, treats 25 million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Tijuana River; directly pumped across the border from the central collection point in Mexico. When the river is flowing, the diversion system of the plant begins operating and diverts up to about 12-13mgd to the IWTP. The total amount of water being diverted must not exceed 25 mgd, based on a monthly average decided upon by permit conditions, although the IWTP can treat sustained flows up to 45mgd daily and peaks of 70mgd for a short period. The diversion system regularly sends approximately six to eight million gallons of water daily to the IWTP. The plant is currently being upgraded to include a secondary treatment facility.\nThe city also four to five decentralize units that are part of the Tijuana/Rosarito Potable Water and Wastewater Master Plan. This plan was required as part of Public Law 106-457, put into order November 7, 2000, which was written to allow the Bajagua project to move forward. The master plan was a binational collaborative effort by EPA and CESPT and addressed San Diego-Tijuana's needs for the next 20 years. The plants are intended to treat approximately 5mgd each, to tertiary levels and provide the reclaimed water to the surrounding areas for agriculture, industry etc. There are several issues that they are facing: no infrastructure to convey the reclaimed water to customers and inadequate groundwater recharge infrastructure.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications ====\nTijuana's telephonic system operates under area code 664, but it is not the same area code 664 that is part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) because Mexico is not one of the countries represented in the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) where the country code is 1. So, to dial a phone number from San Diego to Tijuana requires an international access code and Mexico's Country Code, 52, before dialing the area code and the number.  It is similar for anyone calling from Tijuana to the United States.\nTelephonic landlines in Tijuana are provided by the company Telnor; other companies include Axtel, Izzi Telecom and Alestra. Popular cell phone carriers in the city-region include Movistar, Telcel, and AT&T Mexico. Many U.S. carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile offer free roaming in Mexico and it is possible to connect to U.S. based cell phone towers in many northern parts of the city. Cell phones also have historic usage in Tijuana as the first cellular call in Mexico was made in Tijuana in 1989.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nTijuana is a major gateway to the interior of Mexico to which it is connected by air and road directly, and by sea via the ports of Ensenada and San Diego. Within Tijuana there are freeways and other roads, and buses, but no passenger rail.\nLocal public transportation in Tijuana is run by semiprivate companies, and has one of the most complex, or perhaps unorganized networks.\n\n\n==== Air ====\nThe Tijuana International Airport (General Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez IA) is the city's main airport, one of the busiest in Mexico, and serves eleven airlines with destinations across Mexico and Shanghai, China. Tijuana Airport is also a second main airport for the San Diego area for passengers heading south into Mexico and Latin America, who may use the airport's Cross Border Xpress terminal located on the U.S. side of the border in Otay Mesa and connected to the rest of the airport on the Mexican side by a pedestrian toll bridge. U.S. and Canadian destinations can be reached via the San Diego International Airport, located about 35 kilometers (22 mi) north of the international border.\n\n\n==== Road ====\nTwo important Mexican federal highway corridors start in Tijuana, one of them is Fed 1, which runs south through the Baja California Peninsula through Rosarito Beach, Baja Mar, and Ensenada before ending in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. From Tijuana to Ensenada, most travelers take Fed 1D (scenic road), a four-lane, limited access toll road that runs by the coast starting at Playas de Tijuana. Fed 2 runs east for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) near the international border, as far as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua.\nWithin the metropolitan area the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 freeway connecte Mesa de Otay in the northeast of the city with Rosarito Beach in the southwest.\nJust north of the San Ysidro border crossing, Interstate 5 and Interstate 805 head northbound to San Diego and beyond. From the Otay Mesa border crossing, Interstate 905 takes drivers west to connect with both I-805 and I-5.\n\n\n==== Intercity buses ====\nThe city's main bus station is in its eastern borough. A small terminal downtown serves a few Mexican bus lines, and U.S.-based Greyhound Lines and Crucero USA. Another bus station near the border provides frequent service to Ensenada, and other major cities\u2014including Mazatl\u00e1n, Culiac\u00e1n, Hermosillo, and Guadalajara. Major bus lines operating in Tijuana include Azul y Blanco de Magallanes (Blue & White) and Transporte Efectivo Express de Tijuana \u2013 TEEXTI; modernizing system originally intended to phase out the other lines that partially introduced but ceased and merged with Azul y Blanco.\n\n\n==== Local buses ====\nIn 2006, Tijuana underwent a major overhaul of its existing system of guayines, or shared fixed-route station wagons, forcing the replacement of the guayines with new models of vans, serving as fixed-route taxis. Major transit hubs include Centro (Downtown Tijuana), Otay, Soler, and the Cinco y Diez avenues. Taxi lines operating in the city include Free Taxis, those that do not maintain a specific route; Economic Taxis; Diamond Taxis \u2013 black or yellow cabs; and regular taxis maintaining a set route. There are as many bus lines and routes as fixed-route taxi ones or calafias, and new routes for buses, taxis or calafias are frequently created, due to high demand of public transportation. Public transportation service is inexpensive, with bus tickets at maximum, USD $0.75. Fixed-route taxis are somewhat more expensive, depending on the taxi route, reaching USD $2.00. Bus, taxi and calafia lines and routes are distinguished from one another by their vehicles colors.\n\n\n==== Bus rapid transit ====\n\nA bus rapid transit system SITT operates one route from Downtown Tijuana and Garita Puerto Mexico near the San Ysidro Port of Entry, southeasterly along the Tijuana River to Terminal Insurgentes in the southeast of the city. It is part of a planned system of main and feeder lines to replace other buses and minibuses.\n\n\n==== Light rail ====\nPreviously there have been plans for a light rail service, for example in January 2009, the City Council and the Ministry of Communications and Transportation announced such a system along the Tijuana River, however so far nothing has come of these plans.There is, however, a light rail connection to downtown San Diego and beyond, starting immediately north of the San Ysidro Port of Entry to the U.S. at the San Ysidro Transit Center, where municipal buses also operate.\n\n\n==== Ride share ====\nRide share services Uber and DiDi operate throughout Tijuana and surrounding cities.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nTijuana has multiple sister cities and twin towns. These relations have been formalized by a variety of organizations as well as municipal governments. Currently twinned with the City of Tijuana are:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n Mexico portal\nTijuana Cartel\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nKun, Josh, and Fiamma Montezemolo, eds.

        "wiki": "Tijuana (US:  tee-(H)WAH-n\u0259, Spanish: [ti\u02c8xwana] (listen)) is the largest city of both Baja California State and the Baja California Peninsula. It is part of the San Diego\u2013Tijuana transborder urban agglomeration and the larger Southern California megalopolis. As the 6th-largest city in Mexico and center of the 6th-largest metro area in Mexico, Tijuana exerts a strong influence in education and politics \u2013 across Mexico, in transportation, culture and art \u2013  across all three Californias (the U.S. state of California, Baja California and Baja California Sur), and in manufacturing and as a migration hub \u2013 across the North American continent. Currently one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in Mexico, Tijuana maintains GaWC 'sufficiency city' status. As of 2015, the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,641,570.Tijuana is located on the Pacific coast of Baja California, and is the municipal seat and the cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality (Mexican states are divided into municipalities, rather than counties as in the U.S.). Tijuana covers 70% of the territory of the municipality and contains 80% of its population. A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent, the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies. In the early 21st century,  Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America. Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca. The city is the most visited border city in the world; sharing a border of about 24 km (15 mi) with its sister city San Diego. More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year. This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the fourth busiest land-border crossing in the world. It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone.Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico.  According to the 2015 census, the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico, with a population of 1,840,710, but rankings vary, the city (locality) itself was 6th largest and the municipality (administrative) 3rd largest nationally.  The international metropolitan region was estimated at about 5,158,459 in 2016, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region, 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas, and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico.  Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego.\nTijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias. As the American occupation of the Mexican capital ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Tijuana's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure. The city was founded on July 11, 1889 as urban development began. Often known by its supposed initials, T.J., and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico, the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe city's name comes from the rancho that Santiago Arg\u00fcello Moraga established in 1829 on his Mexican land grant, naming it Rancho T\u00eda Juana.The first Spanish mission call the settlement variously as La T\u00eda Juana, Tiguana, Tiuana, Tiwana, Tijuan, Ticuan, as well as Tijuana. While the Mexican city standardized to Tijuana, the American term for both the river and a U.S. settlement which is now part of San Ysidro remained T\u00eda Juana until the mid-20th century.\nThe commonly accepted theory among historians is that T\u00eda Juana, as Arg\u00fcello named his rancho, is derived from the word Tiwan (\"by the sea\") in the language of the Kumeyaay\u2014the original aboriginal inhabitants of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Urban legend, however, states that T\u00eda Juana, which means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, was a real person whose inn provided food and lodging to travelers. There is however no record of such an inn; in fact the first building in the area was built by Arg\u00fcello in any case, after naming his ranch Rancho T\u00eda Juana.\n\n\n=== Nicknames ===\nIn Southern California, Tijuana is often referred to as TJ or T.J. Baja Californians have adopted this pronunciation as Tiyei. In Spanish the demonym for someone from Tijuana is Tijuanense, while in English the demonym is Tijuanan. A very common slang term used for a person from Tijuana is Tijuanero.The nickname Tijuas is increasingly popular among residents and visitors alike. Due to a recent increase in violence in the city, a new term is developing. The phrase Yo Tijuaneo, \u00bfy t\u00fa? translates to I Tijuanate, and you?. This term comes from a new popular local verb Tijuanear meaning to Tijuana, describing the cosmopolitan aspects of living in the city and frequently crossing the border.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe land was originally inhabited by the Kumeyaay, a tribe of Yuman-speaking hunter-gatherers. Europeans arrived in 1542, when the explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo toured the coastline of the area, which Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno mapped in 1602. In 1769, Juan Cresp\u00ed documented more details about the area that was later called the Valley of Tijuana. Jun\u00edpero Serra founded the first mission of Alta California in nearby San Diego.\nFurther settlement took place near the end of the mission era when Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda, governor of the Baja California and Alta California, awarded a large land grant to Santiago Arg\u00fcello in 1829. This large cattle ranch, Rancho T\u00eda Juana, covered 100 km2 (40 sq mi). Although \"Tia Juana\" means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, the name was actually an adaptation of the word 'Tihuan' or 'Tiju\u00e1n' in the Kumeyaay language, the name of a nearby Kumeyaay settlement and whose meaning is disputed.In 1848, as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War with the United States, Mexico lost all of Alta California. The majority of the 1,000 Hispanic families living in Alta California stayed there, though some moved south to remain inside Mexico. Because of this Tijuana gained a different purpose on the international border. The area had been populated by ranchers, but Tijuana developed a new social economic structure. These were farming and livestock grazing, plus as a transit area for prospectors.\n\n\n=== 1889\u20131915: Town established ===\nUrban settlement began in 1889, when descendants of Santiago Arg\u00fcello and August\u00edn Olvera entered an agreement to begin developing the city of Tijuana. The date of the agreement, July 11, 1889, is recognized as the founding of the city. Tijuana saw its future in tourism from the beginning. From the late 19th century to the first few decades of the 20th century, the city attracted large numbers of Californians coming for trade and entertainment. The California land boom of the 1880s led to the first big wave of tourists, who were called \"excursionists\" and came looking for echoes of the famous novel \"Ramona\" by Helen Hunt Jackson.\nIn 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, revolutionaries claiming loyalty to Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n took over the city for shortly over a month. Federal troops then arrived. Assisted by the \"defensores de Tijuana\", they routed the revolutionaries, who fled north and were promptly arrested by the United States Army.\nThe Panama-California Exposition of 1915 brought many visitors to the nearby California city of San Diego. Tijuana attracted these tourists with a Feria T\u00edpica Mexicana \u2013 Typical Mexican Fair. This included curio shops, regional food, thermal baths, horse racing and boxing.\n\n\n=== 1916\u20131935: Gambling and drinking destination ===\nThe first professional race track opened in January 1916, just south of the border gate. It was almost immediately destroyed by the great \"Hatfield rainmaker\" flood of 1916. Rebuilt in the general area, it ran horse races until the new Agua Caliente track opened in 1929, several miles south and across the river on higher ground.\nLegal drinking and gambling attracted U.S nationals in the 1920s during Prohibition. The Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area became the city's tourist center, with casinos and the Hotel Caesar's, birthplace of the Caesar salad.\nIn 1925, the city by presidential decree changed his name to   ciudad Zaragoza, but its name reverted to Tijuana in 1929.\nIn 1928, the Agua Caliente Touristic Complex was opened, including hotel, spa, dog-track, private airport, golf course and gambling casino. A year later, the new Agua Caliente Racetrack joined the complex. During the eight years it operated, the Agua Caliente hotel, casino and spa achieved a near mythical status, with Hollywood stars and gangsters flying in and playing. Rita Hayworth was discovered there. Musical nightclub productions were broadcast over the radio. A singer known as \"la Faraona\" got shot in a love-triangle and gave birth to the myth of a beautiful lady ghost. Remnants of the Agua Caliente casino can be seen in the outdoor swimming pool and the \"minarete\" (actually a former incinerator chimney) nearby the southern end of Avenida Sanchez Taboada, on the grounds of what is now the Lazaro Cardenas educational complex.\n\n\n=== 1935\u20131965: Tourism broadens ===\nIn 1935, President C\u00e1rdenas decreed an end to gambling and casinos in Baja California, and the Agua Caliente complex faltered, then closed. In 1939, it was reopened as a junior high school (now, Preparatoria L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas). The buildings themselves were torn down in the 1970s and replaced by modern scholastic architecture.\nWith increased tourism and a large number of Mexican citizens relocating to Tijuana, the city's population grew from 21,971 to 65,364 between 1940 and 1950.\n\nWith the decline of nightlife and tourism in the 1950s, the city restructured its tourist industry, by promoting a more family-oriented scene. Tijuana developed a greater variety of attractions and activities to offer its visitors.\n\n\n=== 1965\u20132001: The city matures ===\nIn 1965 the Mexican federal government launched the Border Industrialization Program to attract foreign investment. Tijuana and other border cities became attractive for foreign companies to open maquiladoras (factories), and the Tijuana economy started to diversify. Manufacturing jobs attracted workers from other parts of Mexico and the city's population grew from less than half a million in 1980 to almost 1 million in 1985.\nIn 1972, work began on the first concrete channeling of the Tijuana River; previously the river would flood across a wide plain east and southeast of downtown, inundating an area of wood, cardboard and metal shacks called Cartolandia (\u201cPaperland\u201d).  The project removed the shacks and added 1.8 million sq. m. of usable land, on which the Zona R\u00edo was built. With the 1981 opening of the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana mall and the 1982 Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT), Zona R\u00edo became the new commercial center of a modern Tijuana, and with its new boulevards with monument-filled glorietas (roundabouts), reminiscent of the grand Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, the city created the new image and allure of a modern, large city, rather than just a border town focused on tourism and vice.In 1994, PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana while making an appearance in the plaza of Lomas Taurinas, a neighborhood nestled in a valley near Centro. The shooter was caught and imprisoned, but doubts remain about who the mastermind might have been.\n\n\n=== 2001\u20132011: Violence and decline of US tourism ===\nAfter 9/11, tighter US border controls resulted in hours-long waits to return to the US. The number of US visitors dropped sharply due to this factor, as well as subsequent drug violence.Around 2008, thousands of Tijuana's elite bought houses in and moved to Bonita and Eastlake in Chula Vista, California to escape violence, kidnapping and other crimes taking place during that period. An article in The Los Angeles Times reported that the emigration to San Diego County has transformed the demographic and cultural character of some cities to a degree.\n\n\n=== 2011\u2013present: Tijuana strengthens ===\nIn recent years, Tijuana has become an important city of commerce and migration for Mexico and US. In spite of the violence and border crossing issues, the city has received a large number of tourists from US, China, Japan and the south of Mexico. Thanks to the realization of cultural and business festivals, the city has improved its image before the world, standing out as a competitive city for investment. Currently, the commercial and business sector is committed to the boom in the gastronomic industry, craft beer, entertainment and real estate, as well as medical tourism, to attract visitors and investors.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTijuana is the westernmost city in Mexico, and consequently in Latin America, and the second largest city of northern Mexico. Located about 210 kilometers (130 mi) west of the state capital, Mexicali, the city is bordered to the north by the cities of Imperial Beach, and the San Diego neighborhoods of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, California. To the southwest of the city is Rosarito Beach, while to the south is unincorporated territory of Tijuana Municipality. The city is nestled among hills, canyons, and gullies. The central part of the city lies in a valley through which flows the channeled Tijuana River.\nHousing development in the Tijuana Hills has led to eradication of many seasonal mountain streams. This lack of natural drainage makes places within the city vulnerable to landslides during the rainy season. The varied terrain of Tijuana gives the city elevation extremes that range from sea level to 790 meters (2,590 ft).\nTijuana is noted for its rough terrain, which includes many canyons, steep hills, and mesas. Among noted canyons in Tijuana are Canyon K and Canyon Johnson. Large Tijuana hills include Red Hill (Cerro Colorado) and Hill of the Bees (Cerro de las Abejas) in the eastern part of the city.\nThe city is located near the terminus of the Tijuana River and within the Tijuana River Basin. The Tijuana River is an intermittent river, 195 km (121 mi) long, on the Pacific coast of northern Baja California in Mexico and Southern California in the United States. It drains an arid area along the California\u2013Baja California border, flowing through Mexico for most of its course and then crossing the border for the last 8 km (5 mi) of its course where it forms an estuary that empties into the ocean. The river's lower reaches harbor the last undeveloped coastal wetlands in San Diego County, and some of the last in Southern California, amidst a highly urbanized environment at the southern city limits of Imperial Beach.\nAs downtown Tijuana was built at the bottom of the river valley, the district is subject to seasonal flooding created by drain-off from the Tijuana Hills. During this time, east-bound portions of the Via Rapida (east-west highway) may be blocked off by the Tijuana Police due to hazardous conditions.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city's skyscraper history is relatively recent. Some of the first highrise building complexes constructed in the city were the twin towers of Grand Hotel Tijuana. Tijuana experienced a building boom that was brought to a halt by the Great Recession. Among buildings that succumbed to the time period was the Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico that would have been located in Playas and reached 98 m (322 ft). Currently the tallest building, and soon to be the largest complex in footage, New City Residential reaches 102 m (335 ft). Overall, the city maintains 33 completed structures with other proposed and under-construction skyscrapers.\n\nThe Tijuana skyline is the fifth largest skyline in Mexico and is located in the Zona Rio and to a smaller extent, Playas de Tijuana. In the Zona Rio the buildings are concentrated on the Tijuana River, lined parallel to the river; and on the edges of the Tijuana Country Club. In Playas the high rises are currently focused on the coast. Recent construction on high rises has begun in the aforementioned areas, as buildings such as New City Residential and Grand Hotel Tijuana have been developed and taken prominent places in the skyline as the tallest buildings. From Tijuana's skyline the San Diego skyline can also be seen, although the reverse is mostly not true on account of the high hills surrounding central Tijuana.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Tijuana is divided into eight administrative boroughs, or Delegaciones. The Tijuana metropolitan area occupies all of borough seats. The boroughs are in turn divided into colonias or ejidos. These boroughs offer administrative services such as urban planning, civil registry, inspection, verification, public works and community development and are served by a delegado.\n\nCentro \u2014 \"Delegaci\u00f3n Centro\" includes the old downtown (Zona Centro), new business district (Zona R\u00edo), red light district (Zona Norte), and other adjacent neighborhoods (\"zonas\"). This is the historical midpoint of Tijuana; the municipal palace is located here as well as most of the tourist zones, such as Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n and the business district. The Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT for CEntro CUltural de Tijuana) is located here as well as the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana, until recently the largest mall in the state, within the Zona Rio.\nCerro Colorado \u2014 The Cerro Colorado (\"Red Hill\") is located here and it is surrounded by houses. Because of its height many of the area's antennae for radio and television stations are located on its peak.\nLa Mesa \u2014 This is where the Morelos Park, the largest public park in the city, is located, as well as the retail and transit hub Cinco y Diez, Plaza Mundo Divertido, the new Macroplaza and the CETYS University.\nOtay Centenario \u2014 This borough was created in 2014 by merging Mesa de Otay and Centenario boroughs. In this borough sits the Tijuana International Airport.  The Tijuana campus of the Autonomous University of Baja California and the Technologico are also located here as well as many maquiladoras. This is the borough with the largest number of factories and maquiladoras. Its largest colony is Ciudad Industrial (\"Industrial City\"). Three of the city's most important streets, Boulevard Bellas Artes, Boulevard Industrial and Fed 2, are located here.  This delegacion contains the Otay Mesa entry to the United States and the Friendship Park (Parque de la amistad).\nPlayas de Tijuana \u2014 This is the westernmost borough of the city bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the United States border on the north. This is where the beaches of Tijuana are located (hence the name) and it is also one of the two exits to the south towards Rosarito and Ensenada.\nLa Presa \u2014 literally \"'the dam'\", this is the largest borough in size and the Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez Dam is located within its limits, hence its name. The new Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 and the Tijuana-Tecate freeways run through it.\nSan Antonio de los Buenos \u2014 This is mostly a residential area although it also has two industrial parks.\nSanchez Taboada \u2014 Like the previous borough this is mostly a residential area, but within its borders are located many \"maquiladoras\" specially at Pacific Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTijuana's climate is a semi-arid (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh), with about 231 mm (9.09 in) of annual precipitation, and generally mild to warm weather year-round. It has characteristics of the Mediterranean climate (Csa) found to the immediate north, with most of the annual precipitation falling in the winter, between the months of November and March.\n\nBetween November and March, storms originate from fronts entering off of the Pacific Ocean. January is the wettest month of the year for the city and during this time a periodic event, similar to June Gloom, is observed created by marine layer. January is the coolest month, during which temperatures average 13.6 \u00b0C (56.5 \u00b0F). In the city April signifies the end of winter and the start of Santa Ana winds. Though the daytime highs are generally around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), heat waves can reach up to 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F). The hottest months in the city are August and September, during which temperatures average 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Summers are by far the driest time of year since influences from the California Current and the North Pacific High suppress the formation of rainfall caused by the North American Monsoon. As in coastal Southern California, air pollution sometimes occurs during periods of temperature inversion, especially during summer and fall, but (unlike Mexico City) is seldom severe and in recent years has lessened due to cleaner car engines.Frost and snow are rare phenomena in the city as temperatures are usually well above freezing. Yet, in December 1967, snow fell in the city and in January 2007 feather light snow fell in the east of the city. However, excessive amounts of snow fall have never been recorded in the city. On February 14, 2008 a winter storm caused an unusual snowfall in the upper reaches of the hills of the city.\nThe record low temperature recorded in the city was \u22126 \u00b0C (21 \u00b0F), while the highest was 49 \u00b0C (120 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nTijuana has a diverse cosmopolitan population which includes migrants from other parts of Mexico and from all over the world. Tijuana has one of Mexico's largest Asian populations, predominantly consisting of Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese immigrants. Tijuana also has a large and rapidly growing population of United States citizens, mostly from Southern California.  Many Latin Americans, notably Cubans, and Guatemalans, have made Tijuana their home. The city also has many Lebanese, Italian, French, Spanish citizens. Recently, the city has received a large influx of Haitian immigrants.\n\nThe majority of Tijuana's migrant Mexican population hail from Sinaloa, Michoac\u00e1n, Jalisco, Oaxaca, and the Federal District. Because of the diversity of Mexico and the influx of immigrants from almost every region in the country, there are no accurate estimates on ethnicity or race of the current population. The heavy influx of immigrants to the city and municipality of Tijuana has led to job creation in the form of over 700 twin-plant (maquiladora) factories, which serve as the basis of employment for the majority of the working-class people in northern Mexico.  The high poverty level in Tijuana is attributed to the city's \"magnet status\" for people who have come from the poorer south of the nation and citizens from other nations seeking to escape from extreme poverty.  Tijuana holds a status that provides the possibility of employment as well as higher education and the dream of crossing the border.  Tijuana and Baja California in general have much stronger economies and higher incomes than other Mexican cities along the United States border, as well as more moderate weather.\nTijuana today is one of the fastest growing cities in Mexico with an average of 80,000 people moving to Tijuana yearly.  In terms of area, the city grows by approximately three hectares a day, mostly east and south as the city is mostly built out to the beach already with the exception of some canyons.  Along with settlements separated from Tijuana proper and other communities unimproved land, big business moves in providing supermarkets and retail to marginal areas, along with paved roads.  The city experiences the construction of 26,000 new settlers a year that has led to the unregulated, illegal squatter homes that takes place in the hills and valleys of ever expanding Tijuana, most of these areas are still without city services like sidewalks, paving, streetlights, and public transit. This is an ongoing process: as older and existing squatter areas are brought into the city services, more marginal areas become occupied by squatters.\nSquatter areas are home to displaced and uprooted people, among them the indigenous and poverty stricken, as well as migrants deported from the USA, many of whom are also without Mexican citizenship.  In recent years, working-class suburban housing estates have sprung up in the fringes to provide a sense of safety and land ownership.  These suburbs enable young families to isolate their families from the violence of the drug war and squatter areas.  These outlying communities tend to be much better equipped than their squatter counterparts.  Nevertheless, some remote areas are drug plantations for narcotics, and delinquency has spread to areas once considered safe havens.  These issues occasionally come to light in the newspapers.\nNational Population Council (CONAPO) data has estimated that by 2030, growth rates maintaining, the city will become the second largest in Mexico and anchor to the fourth largest metropolitan area in Mexico. The suburban sprawl observed in Tijuana leaves the downtown and beach areas relatively affluent.\n\nWhile the INEGI Census 2010 placed Tijuana's population at 1.3 million, only two percent more than in 2005 Census, Tijuana City Council estimates from 2010 place the population closer to two million, at 1.6 million. As funding for cities is based on the populace of the city, the Council worries about receiving adequate funds to provide for the needs of the city.  The population discrepancies may be explained by a few factors.  Shanty towns that have not been rasterized and an undercount, people having left Tijuana for United States, and people leaving Tijuana for the interior of Mexico due to the intensification of the drug war, and suburbanization outside city limits but still inside the municipality.  Tijuana, because of the dreams of border crossers, and its relatively higher wages compared to the rest of Mexico, naturally attracts immigrants.  Since an improvement in security since 2011, the population of Tijuana as reflected in the 2015 Mexican census is expected to return to its normal growth curve; the great reduction in violence should make the settlement of Tijuana an attractive option again versus fringe valleys, nevertheless exact figures from the census await.\nAccording to the Second Census of Population and Housing of the year 2010 conducted by the INEGI (National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics) the municipality of Tijuana has 1,559,683 inhabitants within 879 km2, the city or settlement of Tijuana only covers \u2154 of that area.  While the metropolitan area of Tijuana (1392 km2), composed of Tijuana Municipality and Rosarito Beach Municipality, has 1,751,302 inhabitants. Tecate Municipality, adjacent to Tijuana Municipality, has not yet been considered by the government as part of the metropolitan area.  However, there is great economic and cultural exchange between the cities regions though there are still expanses of rural land. As Tijuana grows, many of its suburbs have been built increasingly inland, and in the direction of Tecate; Valley of the Palms is a large planned city between the two.\nAs of 2005 the large majority of the city's population, 96%, adhere to the beliefs of Christianity. The denominations are further divided into followers of Catholicism \u2013 61% \u2013 and of Protestantism \u2013 35%.  While other beliefs occupying a 4% margin in the city include Taoism (among other Asian and European religions), atheism and agnosticism is also found.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nTijuana is the birthplace and base of the Tijuana Cartel.  From 2007 through 2010, Tijuana experienced an unusually high level of violent crime related to gang violence, in part derived from the Mexican drug war and human trafficking.  Homicides peaked in 2010, when 844 people were killed, compared with 355 in 2004 and 349 in the first eight months of 2011. Reportedly, the wave of violence resulted from a turf war as the administration of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n weakened the local Arellano F\u00e9lix cartel; violence slowed when the larger Sinaloa cartel took control.During peak years of violent crime in the city, gun battles between rival cartels, and between cartels and the police, erupted in public. In April 2008, police found 1,500 shell casings on various streets after one battle left 13 suspected drug traffickers dead. In 2009 and depending on the source, Tijuana Municipality experienced either 556 or 1,118 murders, mostly as a result of the drug war.There were 492 murders in 2013, a 48% increase in the homicide rate between 2012 and 2013. This was the highest number of murders since 2010. By the end of 2017, the number of murders in Tijuana increased to 1,744, which was almost double those in 2016.As of 2018, Tijuana had the highest per capita rate for homicides in the world at 138 murders per 100,000 people.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Region ===\n\nAt present the parties with greater presence in Tijuana are the National Action Party (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). The PAN has been the dominant party in the city for 20 years. Historically the PRI had been the dominant party in regional politics, until 1989 when the PAN began to dominate the city, until yet again, in 2004, PRI began regaining prominence and won the Mayor's Office.\nLess prominent parties also maintain relations with the dominant parties. These other parties, with less presence include the New Alliance Party (PANAL), Social Encounter Party (PES), and Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Allied with the PAN at the state and local level under the Alliance for Baja California are the Social Encounter Party (PES) and New Alliance Party (PANAL). Allied with the PRI at the state and local level under the \"Alliance for Better Living\" are the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) and Baja California State Party (PEBC).\n\n\n=== International ===\nTijuana's importance and rise to a global city has led to its recognition among countries worldwide. In addition to international cultural recognition, Tijuana has received political recognition and is a developing a political center currently host to eight consulates from European, Asian, and North American countries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\n\nTijuana is a large manufacturing center, and in addition to tourism, it serves as a cornerstone of the city economy. In the past decade alone, Tijuana became the medical device manufacture capital of the North American continent, surpassing previous leader Minneapolis - Saint Paul.The city's proximity to Southern California and its large, skilled, diverse, and relatively inexpensive workforce make it an attractive city for foreign companies looking to establish extensive industrial parks composed of assembly plants that are called maquiladoras, even more so than other cities in the US-Mexican border zone, taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to export products. At its peak, in 2001 Tijuana had roughly 820 of these 'maquiladoras'. Foreign and domestic companies employ thousands of employees in these plants, usually in assembly-related labor. Such jobs are not demanding but typically offer above average salaries for Mexico, with most maqiladoras jobs beginning at Mex$100 per day (about 5 US dollars, as of September 2016), significantly above the Mexican minimum wage of Mex$57.46 (about 3 US dollars, as of September 2016). Companies that have set up maquiladoras in Tijuana include Lanix, Hyundai, Sony, Vortec, BMW, Vizio, Toyota, Dell, Samsung, Kodak, Matsushita/Panasonic, GE, Nabisco, Ford, Microsoft, Cemex, Zonda, Philips, Pioneer, Airbus, Plantronics, Siemens Mexico, Jaguar, Pall Medical, Tara, Sanyo and Volkswagen. Many of the maquiladoras are located in the Otay Mesa and Florido sections of Tijuana.\nEconomic development has its central business district at Zona R\u00edo, which together, with the corridor along Blvd. Agua Caliente (the extension of Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n), contains the majority of the higher-end office space in the city.\n\n\n=== Tourist economy and entertainment ===\nTijuana also relies on tourism for a major part of its revenue. About 300,000 visitors cross by foot or car from the San Ysidro point of entry in the United States every day. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs, and shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are part of the draw for the city's tourists, many located within walking distance of the border. The city's tourist centers include Downtown Tijuana including the nightlife hot spots around La Sexta, Avenida Revolucion, souvenir shopping at the Mercado de Artesan\u00edas and Plaza Viva Tijuana, Tijuana's Cultural Center (CECUT) and neighboring Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana shopping center, and the city's best known vices, in the form of its legal Red Light District and gambling (Agua Caliente). Mexico's drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college aged Southern Californians who tend to stay on Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n.\nTijuana is also known for its red-light district Zona Norte (also referred to as La Coahuila after one of its main streets) with legal prostitution in strip clubs and on the street. The strip clubs are typically full-contact, meaning the dancers let patrons fondle them. Many dancers also sell their sexual services. In a 1999 estimation, there were 15,000 women engaged in prostitution in Tijuana outside of clubs and brothels.Tijuana has many pharmacies that target visitors from the United States, which sell some medicines without prescriptions and/or at much lower costs than in the U.S. Many medications still require a Mexican prescription, which can be obtained from adjacent doctors' offices. People filling up prescriptions for drugs classified in the US as Schedule II or Schedule III have found it more difficult to locate such medications, and the purchase of pseudoephedrine also has become restricted by Tijuana pharmacies, just as in the U.S. To fill a prescription in Tijuana for any drug covered by the US Controlled Substances Act  and legally bring it into the United States requires a prescription from the United States for re-import.  Americans can import up to a 90-day supply of non-controlled medications for personal use to the USA from Mexico and other countries.\nBusinesses such as auto detailing, medical and dental services and plastic surgery are heavily marketed, and are usually much less expensive than in the U.S.\nTijuana is headquarters for Mexico's largest gambling concern, Grupo Caliente, which operates the only casinos in the city, more than twenty branches.Tourists are sometimes robbed by municipal police.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nPlaza Rio Tijuana is a large regional mall anchored by Cin\u00e9polis, Sanborns, S\u00faper DAX and Sears.\nAll across the city, there are dozens of plazas comerciales, which may be strip malls or small enclosed or open-air centers, with a combination of any or all of the following anchors:\n\none of the 26 Tijuana branches of the small department store Coppel,\na supermarket or hypermarket,\na cin\u00e9polis or cinemex multicinema,\na branch of the electronics and motorcycle retailer ElektraAn important concentration of plazas is in the Cinco y Diez around an eponymous intersection, named for a former American-style five and dime store that was located there. It is also a major hub for public transit. Plaza Carrousel, with its namesake merry-go-round, is located here.\nCostco, Sam's Club, and Walmart each have multiple branches across the city.\nTraditional markets with vendors include the large Mercado Hidalgo in Zona R\u00edo, smaller neighborhood markets and the Mercado Municipal downtown.\nTijuana was the headquarters of 14-store Dorian's department store chain until its demise in 2009; most were converted to Sears stores.\n\n\n=== Culinary ===\nTijuana, along with the nearby Valle de Guadalupe, has recently become a culinary hotspot due to its Baja Med cuisine, including chefs such as Javier Plascencia, but also for its tacos, other street food, food trucks, coffee houses and artisanal beer.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTijuana is home to many private Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and High Schools as well as nationally high ranked colleges and universities. Notable primary and secondary schools include Metropolitan, Instituto M\u00e9xico, Instituto Cumbres, President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas School, Agua Caliente School Center High, Polit\u00e9cnico de Baja California(CLUB DE QU\u00cdMICA), Jos\u00e9 Fimbres Moreno School and the State High School, and Ignacio Ram\u00edrez School located in Cerro Colorado. These schools maintain recognition for their demands and high standards.\nTijuana maintains multiple higher education institutions. These include the Autonomous University of Baja California, Tijuana (UABC), Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Tijuana (ITT), Universidad Iberoamericana (UIA-Tijuana), CETYS Universidad, Universidad Xochicalco, and University of the Californias. Other colleges include Tijuana University Center, Tijuana University of Technology, Graduate Center of the Northwest, and the University of Professional Development. The city is the seat of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), an institution of scientific research and higher education, specializing in the study of the problems in the border region between Mexico and the United States. In August 2009, Metropolitan UABC opened in Valle de Las Palmas, in the Tijuana metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Culture and contemporary life ==\nMany foreigners travel to Tijuana to drink and dance, buy prescription drugs, purchase bootleg brand-name clothing, timepieces, and other personal accessories found globally, as well as manufactured and hand-crafted local curiosities. Locals and regular tourists avoid hassles by visiting the clubs at Plaza Fiesta or other areas of the Zona R\u00edo without the crowds, heavy marketing, and occasional tourist misbehavior or outright lawbreaking common on the Revoluci\u00f3n strip. However, Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n has been known for its proliferation of nightclub shows, primarily catering to casual tourists. While still an entertaining town with an enjoyable atmosphere, some locals and tourists feel it has lost an \"anything goes\" atmosphere, that was dangerous to locals, tourists, and the tourism industry.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nAs Tijuana matured from a tourist-oriented border town into one of Mexico's largest cities, the 1982 opening of the Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT) marked a milestone. CECUT's mission was to strengthening Tijuana's image, both to US visitors and to Mexicans, as a destination for culture and not only shopping and vice. The center includes an OMNIMAX cinema showing IMAX films, the Museum of the Californias, contemporary art exhibition halls, a restaurant, caf\u00e9, bookstore,  and other cultural facilities.\nLa Casa de la Cultura cultural center comprises a school, a theater, and a public library, and teaches dance, painting, music, plastic arts, photography and languages.\nOther cultural venues include the Instituto Municipal de Arte y Cultura (Municipal Institute of Art and Culture), the Tijuana Wax Museum, the Museo El Trompo (Trompo Museum), and El Foro, the former Jai Alai Palace, that is now a concert venue. Concerts are also held at the Estadio Caliente stadium, Hip\u00f3dromo Agua Caliente Racetrack, and at the \"Audiorama\" at the Museo El Trompo children's museum of science and technology.The Tijuana Country Club (Club Campestre de Tijuana) has many affluent members and a famous golf course and also functions as an entertainment and events venue. Tijuana also has a large Rotary Club.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\nParque Morelos has a small zoo and park space; Parque de la Amistad in Otay Centenario has a small pond, and a running and dirt-bike track. Parque Teniente Guerrero is a downtown park with a public library and weekend entertainment by clowns.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nTijuana's nightlife scene is one of the city's strongest attractions. The area surrounding \"La Sexta\", the intersection at Calle Sexta and Av. Revoluci\u00f3n, is now a major hub of new bars and dance clubs. Zona Rio, Tijuana's new Downtown, is home to some of the city's finest restaurants and bars. Another capstone of Tijuana's entertainment offerings is its adult nightlife industry, which includes the city's red light district as well as less conspicuous adult entertainment venues.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nTijuana also has a very active and independent artist community whose internationally recognized work has earned Tijuana the title of \"one of the most important new cultural meccas\", according to Newsweek, an exhibition of Tijuana's current art scene, is being curated by the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and is traveling across the USA in 2006 and 2007. Art collectives like Bulbo and film production like Palenque Filmaciones explore the use of film like the award-winning Tijuana Makes Me Happy, media like television bulbo TV and print \"bulbo PRESS\", to show different realities of Tijuana out of Mexico. In 2004, Tijuana earned international acclaim for an art exhibition displayed on the cement banks of the Tijuana River and along the Mexico/U.S. border fence in Otay Mesa.\nGraffiti is widespread in Tijuana. They can range from free-hand writing in spray can and marker form, often carrying social or sexual commentary in English or Spanish, pictures in wheatpaste and stencils, consisting of stenciled renderings of personalities crucial to Hispanic culture from past and present eras, such as television news announcers or stars, but also extending to images of artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed. Graffiti in Tijuana may seem at first to consist largely of simplistic tags and thus not as technically evolved, colorful, or accepted in the mainstream as the \"pieces\" of graffiti scenes of the United States, Europe, or Japan, but large, colorful graffiti murals adorn walls from both native Tijuanan artists as well as visiting graffiti writers, especially from California. The Tijuanan art pieces show as much prowess and skill as those made by their more renowned U.S. counterparts, although illicit graffiti are strongly discouraged by the Tijuana government, as in other major metropolitan areas.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nSince the decade of the 1920s, Tijuana has excelled in the musical field, thanks to the first groups of ranchera music that began to set the tourist establishments in the area with the visit of foreigners, including the former Casino Agua Caliente.\nRock music was very popular and popular among young people in the mid-50s, leaving the ranch rhythm aside years ago. Another event that added the arrival of Rock to Tijuana was the visit of the African-American pianist and guitarist, Gene Ross, who came to play at the Convoy Club on Revolution Avenue. The presence of this artist was the beginning of the rock scene in the region that marked a new style in the country.54 Some groupings of the nascent Mexican rock began, an example of which was \"The Tijuana Five\", who made some covers in Spanish of Anglo-Saxon successes.\nJavier Batiz founded in 1957 he founded a group called \"Los TJ's\" with which he collected musical influences that were received in the Mexican border cities of black music, blues and R&B from people like T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin 'Wolf, James Brown, among others. Later he would start his solo career in the rest of the country and participating in some bands in Mexico City.\nDuring the 60s, the American trumpeter Herb Alpert, in a visit to the bullfights made in the old Bullfight, found musical inspiration so after the recording of his single \"The Lonely Bull\", which was a radio hit in 1962. With the success, he decided to make a casting and formed \"The Tijuana Brass\", with whom he toured and had a presentation on television. It was a musical collaboration with artists from Los Angeles, with style called \"Tijuana Marimba\u00b4s Brass\". The band was dissolved in 1969 but they continued with some presentations under the name of T.J.B. 55\nAt the end of the 60s and during the 70s, rock and roll still had great acceptance in the public. In those years bands such as \"The Moonlights\" had national and international recognition, who achieved successes such as \"Tijuana Funky\" or \"Are you\"; the \"Rockin Devils\", recognized for their Spanish cover of \"Bule Bule\", which achieved international success. The Roble Cinema, La Caba\u00f1a club and Flamingos club, would be some of the main stages of the decade for musical performances in the city.56\nIn the 70s, rock groups and musicians experienced government rejection and censorship for the lyrics of the songs. Romantic music took a boom and from there came bands like \"The Battle of Tijuana\", \"Los Solitarios\", \"Los Terr\u00edcolas\", \"Old Memories\", \"Tito Pantoja and his friends\", \"Ritmo 7\", \"Los Old Friends \",\" California Brass \"and \"Los Corazones Solitarios\", among others.\nIn the late 80s, Antonio De Carlo, was recognized as a revelation artist at the OTI Festival, having a successful career during the 90s, with songs such as \"In A Thousand Pieces\", \"A Pecho Discovery\", \"Revolution\" and \"Like It Hurts \". Lynda also gained national relevance in pop, achieving hits in songs like \"Lost Heart\", \"Tell\", \"A Thousand for an Hour\", among others.\nDespite the downturn in rock artists for some years, in the 90s Tijuana No! emerged, returning a bit of the genre to the city. They also incorporated ska, punk and reggae. \"No\" would be the first album released, from which successes like \"Pobre de ti\", which had Julieta Venegas as a vocalist, would emerge. Later the singer began her solo career already in the 00s of the 21st century. Her musical career reached the recording of six studio albums, and she won two Grammys, six Latin Grammys, six MTV Latin America and two Latin Music Billboard.\nThe city continued to be a hotbed of important rock bands, among them, especially at the international level, Specimen, other bands and prominent artists could be Ohtli, Nona Delichas, Canseco, Sonoro 2 and Headlongs. Electronic music boomed in the 90s, Murcof and the Nortec Collective, entered the scene and began to gain worldwide recognition for merging electronic music with northern and band music. This group was enriched with the visual contribution of designers and videographers who, under the same concept, provided images to this musical proposal.\nRegarding Mexican regional music, some groups of the northern genre were emerging, highlighting Los Tucanes de Tijuana, who since the 80s began their musical career until popularizing songs such as \"La Chona\", \"El Tucanazo\", \"La Chica Sexy\", among others. The Agua Caliente Band, Explosi\u00f3n Norte\u00f1a, among others, would be a new generation of Mexican popular music artists.\nAmong other things, Tijuana has been the inspiration for the birthplace of Nortec music style and Ruidoson, resulting in a very large and active electronic music scene where groups and artists like Los Macuanos, Maria y Jose, Siberium, Hidhawk and Harpocrates emerged. Tijuana also enjoys a large base of support in many other musical scenes such as mexican hip hop, reggae, hardcore, punk, black metal and house music. Famous musicians are from Tijuana including the pop-rock singer-songwriter Lynda Thomas and Vanessa Zamora and international indie punk bands like Delux and Los Kung-Fu Monkeys.\nTo promote the cultural development in children and youth of Tijuana, since 1996 the Tijuana Youth Symphony (SJT) has been promoted, which promotes education and musical training through instrument practices, music reading and public concerts. In addition, Tijuana has an opera season. There are also several musical festivals throughout the year, among which the Latin American Guitar Festival, Mainly Mozart Binacional, and the International Exhibition of contemporary dance \"Bodies in Transit\" stand out.\nTijuana is home to the Baja California Orchestra, one of the most prestigious and solid artistic institutions in northwestern Mexico, which was nominated for the Latin Grammy in the category of best classical album by the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Inc ., with the album Tango kills Danz\u00f3n kills Tango. This phonogram was distinguished as 'Best Classical Album of the year 2001' by the Mexican Union of Theater and Music Chroniclers. Currently, it maintains an annual season, offering symphonic and chamber music concerts in the most important forums of Tijuana and Baja California.\nAlready in the new century, many local bands have emerged, from all musical genres, some of them staying with local and national recognition. Highlights Nosis, High Slogan, Go Future, Ramona, The Children of the Saint, Among Deserts, Ziruela, Palos Verdes, Edwin, among others. Each of them have contributed and tried to revive the musical talent for which Tijuana has always been characterized.\nMusical clubs along the Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area and others often cater to a diverse range of tastes by offering nightly variations on musical fare, such as new wave music one night, and punk rock bands on the next. Some European metal bands whose members cannot perform in the United States due to prior felony convictions in their own countries play music festivals in Tijuana for fans from both Mexico and the United States.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city is home to the Tijuana Zonkeys professional basketball team of the CIBACOPA basketball league. The team is composed mostly of players from Mexico and plays from February to July in the Municipal Auditorium.\nThe city has a strong tradition of association football, Club Tijuana began playing in the Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n on the 2011/12 season, winning the 2012 Apertura title. They play their matches at the Estadio Caliente, a new 33,000 seat stadium. The team's mascot is the Xoloitzcuintle, a famous Mexican hairless dog.\nTijuana also has a long history of producing many world champion professional boxers, such as Antonio Margarito and Erik Morales.\n\n\n=== Stadiums ===\nEstadio Caliente\n\nThe stadium is the Estadio Caliente, match venue for Club Tijuana, a Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n football team. It is located in the Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Baja California (Mexico). Caliente Homes Stadium, is a multi-purpose center in Tijuana. It is mainly used for football matches, has a seating capacity of 21,000 spectators.  Opened in June 2008, according to the work schedule. It was a significant reason for Tijuana Club was promoted to the M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n; FEMEXFUT requires participating teams should have a stadium with a seating capacity of over 15,000. It is at this stage the U-17 FIBA Americas Championship 2009 was held bound for Nigeria. Was introduced in M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n during the Apertura 2011 tournament of the Mexican Football Federation.Estadio Chevron\n\nThe Chevron Stadium  is the home of the Toros de Tijuana. It opened in 1977 and housed the Colts missing Tijuana Mexican Pacific League. Subsequently, the stadium was used for football matches. For 2004, professional baseball returned, now with a franchise LMB under the name of Toros de Tijuana, which, the following year, changed its name to Colts as it had been known previously. At first the facility was called Cerro Colorado Stadium, due to its location at the foot of the hill of that name. With the return of baseball, chain supermarkets Calimax bought the naming rights to the stadium.  In 2004, the first season of Toros, the fans filled the stadium for most matches.  On April 4, 2013, the stadium was remodeled, marking the beginning of a new era for Toros de Tijuana.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\n\n\n==== Water ====\nThe Tijuana State Commission of Public Services (CESPT) supplies the city with its water, while the city receives its electricity from La Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE).\nIn 2019, due to extremely low water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir, CESPT began a city-wide water rationing scheme. This rationing scheme would divide Tijuana and nearby Rosarito into 5 zones. Each zone would be cut-off from the water supply on a rotating schedule of 4 days with water and 1 day without water. This scheme was expected to last for at least 2 months until the water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir were improved.\n\n\n==== Wastewater ====\nThe International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) developed, as a joint project of the USA and Mexico in the mid-1980s following substantial environmental studies, treats 25 million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Tijuana River; directly pumped across the border from the central collection point in Mexico. When the river is flowing, the diversion system of the plant begins operating and diverts up to about 12-13mgd to the IWTP. The total amount of water being diverted must not exceed 25 mgd, based on a monthly average decided upon by permit conditions, although the IWTP can treat sustained flows up to 45mgd daily and peaks of 70mgd for a short period. The diversion system regularly sends approximately six to eight million gallons of water daily to the IWTP. The plant is currently being upgraded to include a secondary treatment facility.\nThe city also four to five decentralize units that are part of the Tijuana/Rosarito Potable Water and Wastewater Master Plan. This plan was required as part of Public Law 106-457, put into order November 7, 2000, which was written to allow the Bajagua project to move forward. The master plan was a binational collaborative effort by EPA and CESPT and addressed San Diego-Tijuana's needs for the next 20 years. The plants are intended to treat approximately 5mgd each, to tertiary levels and provide the reclaimed water to the surrounding areas for agriculture, industry etc. There are several issues that they are facing: no infrastructure to convey the reclaimed water to customers and inadequate groundwater recharge infrastructure.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications ====\nTijuana's telephonic system operates under area code 664, but it is not the same area code 664 that is part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) because Mexico is not one of the countries represented in the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) where the country code is 1. So, to dial a phone number from San Diego to Tijuana requires an international access code and Mexico's Country Code, 52, before dialing the area code and the number.  It is similar for anyone calling from Tijuana to the United States.\nTelephonic landlines in Tijuana are provided by the company Telnor; other companies include Axtel, Izzi Telecom and Alestra. Popular cell phone carriers in the city-region include Movistar, Telcel, and AT&T Mexico. Many U.S. carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile offer free roaming in Mexico and it is possible to connect to U.S. based cell phone towers in many northern parts of the city. Cell phones also have historic usage in Tijuana as the first cellular call in Mexico was made in Tijuana in 1989.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nTijuana is a major gateway to the interior of Mexico to which it is connected by air and road directly, and by sea via the ports of Ensenada and San Diego. Within Tijuana there are freeways and other roads, and buses, but no passenger rail.\nLocal public transportation in Tijuana is run by semiprivate companies, and has one of the most complex, or perhaps unorganized networks.\n\n\n==== Air ====\nThe Tijuana International Airport (General Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez IA) is the city's main airport, one of the busiest in Mexico, and serves eleven airlines with destinations across Mexico and Shanghai, China. Tijuana Airport is also a second main airport for the San Diego area for passengers heading south into Mexico and Latin America, who may use the airport's Cross Border Xpress terminal located on the U.S. side of the border in Otay Mesa and connected to the rest of the airport on the Mexican side by a pedestrian toll bridge. U.S. and Canadian destinations can be reached via the San Diego International Airport, located about 35 kilometers (22 mi) north of the international border.\n\n\n==== Road ====\nTwo important Mexican federal highway corridors start in Tijuana, one of them is Fed 1, which runs south through the Baja California Peninsula through Rosarito Beach, Baja Mar, and Ensenada before ending in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. From Tijuana to Ensenada, most travelers take Fed 1D (scenic road), a four-lane, limited access toll road that runs by the coast starting at Playas de Tijuana. Fed 2 runs east for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) near the international border, as far as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua.\nWithin the metropolitan area the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 freeway connecte Mesa de Otay in the northeast of the city with Rosarito Beach in the southwest.\nJust north of the San Ysidro border crossing, Interstate 5 and Interstate 805 head northbound to San Diego and beyond. From the Otay Mesa border crossing, Interstate 905 takes drivers west to connect with both I-805 and I-5.\n\n\n==== Intercity buses ====\nThe city's main bus station is in its eastern borough. A small terminal downtown serves a few Mexican bus lines, and U.S.-based Greyhound Lines and Crucero USA. Another bus station near the border provides frequent service to Ensenada, and other major cities\u2014including Mazatl\u00e1n, Culiac\u00e1n, Hermosillo, and Guadalajara. Major bus lines operating in Tijuana include Azul y Blanco de Magallanes (Blue & White) and Transporte Efectivo Express de Tijuana \u2013 TEEXTI; modernizing system originally intended to phase out the other lines that partially introduced but ceased and merged with Azul y Blanco.\n\n\n==== Local buses ====\nIn 2006, Tijuana underwent a major overhaul of its existing system of guayines, or shared fixed-route station wagons, forcing the replacement of the guayines with new models of vans, serving as fixed-route taxis. Major transit hubs include Centro (Downtown Tijuana), Otay, Soler, and the Cinco y Diez avenues. Taxi lines operating in the city include Free Taxis, those that do not maintain a specific route; Economic Taxis; Diamond Taxis \u2013 black or yellow cabs; and regular taxis maintaining a set route. There are as many bus lines and routes as fixed-route taxi ones or calafias, and new routes for buses, taxis or calafias are frequently created, due to high demand of public transportation. Public transportation service is inexpensive, with bus tickets at maximum, USD $0.75. Fixed-route taxis are somewhat more expensive, depending on the taxi route, reaching USD $2.00. Bus, taxi and calafia lines and routes are distinguished from one another by their vehicles colors.\n\n\n==== Bus rapid transit ====\n\nA bus rapid transit system SITT operates one route from Downtown Tijuana and Garita Puerto Mexico near the San Ysidro Port of Entry, southeasterly along the Tijuana River to Terminal Insurgentes in the southeast of the city. It is part of a planned system of main and feeder lines to replace other buses and minibuses.\n\n\n==== Light rail ====\nPreviously there have been plans for a light rail service, for example in January 2009, the City Council and the Ministry of Communications and Transportation announced such a system along the Tijuana River, however so far nothing has come of these plans.There is, however, a light rail connection to downtown San Diego and beyond, starting immediately north of the San Ysidro Port of Entry to the U.S. at the San Ysidro Transit Center, where municipal buses also operate.\n\n\n==== Ride share ====\nRide share services Uber and DiDi operate throughout Tijuana and surrounding cities.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nTijuana has multiple sister cities and twin towns. These relations have been formalized by a variety of organizations as well as municipal governments. Currently twinned with the City of Tijuana are:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n Mexico portal\nTijuana Cartel\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nKun, Josh, and Fiamma Montezemolo, eds.

        "wiki": "Tijuana (US:  tee-(H)WAH-n\u0259, Spanish: [ti\u02c8xwana] (listen)) is the largest city of both Baja California State and the Baja California Peninsula. It is part of the San Diego\u2013Tijuana transborder urban agglomeration and the larger Southern California megalopolis. As the 6th-largest city in Mexico and center of the 6th-largest metro area in Mexico, Tijuana exerts a strong influence in education and politics \u2013 across Mexico, in transportation, culture and art \u2013  across all three Californias (the U.S. state of California, Baja California and Baja California Sur), and in manufacturing and as a migration hub \u2013 across the North American continent. Currently one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in Mexico, Tijuana maintains GaWC 'sufficiency city' status. As of 2015, the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,641,570.Tijuana is located on the Pacific coast of Baja California, and is the municipal seat and the cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality (Mexican states are divided into municipalities, rather than counties as in the U.S.). Tijuana covers 70% of the territory of the municipality and contains 80% of its population. A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent, the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies. In the early 21st century,  Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America. Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca. The city is the most visited border city in the world; sharing a border of about 24 km (15 mi) with its sister city San Diego. More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year. This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the fourth busiest land-border crossing in the world. It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone.Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico.  According to the 2015 census, the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico, with a population of 1,840,710, but rankings vary, the city (locality) itself was 6th largest and the municipality (administrative) 3rd largest nationally.  The international metropolitan region was estimated at about 5,158,459 in 2016, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region, 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas, and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico.  Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego.\nTijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias. As the American occupation of the Mexican capital ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Tijuana's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure. The city was founded on July 11, 1889 as urban development began. Often known by its supposed initials, T.J., and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico, the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe city's name comes from the rancho that Santiago Arg\u00fcello Moraga established in 1829 on his Mexican land grant, naming it Rancho T\u00eda Juana.The first Spanish mission call the settlement variously as La T\u00eda Juana, Tiguana, Tiuana, Tiwana, Tijuan, Ticuan, as well as Tijuana. While the Mexican city standardized to Tijuana, the American term for both the river and a U.S. settlement which is now part of San Ysidro remained T\u00eda Juana until the mid-20th century.\nThe commonly accepted theory among historians is that T\u00eda Juana, as Arg\u00fcello named his rancho, is derived from the word Tiwan (\"by the sea\") in the language of the Kumeyaay\u2014the original aboriginal inhabitants of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Urban legend, however, states that T\u00eda Juana, which means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, was a real person whose inn provided food and lodging to travelers. There is however no record of such an inn; in fact the first building in the area was built by Arg\u00fcello in any case, after naming his ranch Rancho T\u00eda Juana.\n\n\n=== Nicknames ===\nIn Southern California, Tijuana is often referred to as TJ or T.J. Baja Californians have adopted this pronunciation as Tiyei. In Spanish the demonym for someone from Tijuana is Tijuanense, while in English the demonym is Tijuanan. A very common slang term used for a person from Tijuana is Tijuanero.The nickname Tijuas is increasingly popular among residents and visitors alike. Due to a recent increase in violence in the city, a new term is developing. The phrase Yo Tijuaneo, \u00bfy t\u00fa? translates to I Tijuanate, and you?. This term comes from a new popular local verb Tijuanear meaning to Tijuana, describing the cosmopolitan aspects of living in the city and frequently crossing the border.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe land was originally inhabited by the Kumeyaay, a tribe of Yuman-speaking hunter-gatherers. Europeans arrived in 1542, when the explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo toured the coastline of the area, which Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno mapped in 1602. In 1769, Juan Cresp\u00ed documented more details about the area that was later called the Valley of Tijuana. Jun\u00edpero Serra founded the first mission of Alta California in nearby San Diego.\nFurther settlement took place near the end of the mission era when Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda, governor of the Baja California and Alta California, awarded a large land grant to Santiago Arg\u00fcello in 1829. This large cattle ranch, Rancho T\u00eda Juana, covered 100 km2 (40 sq mi). Although \"Tia Juana\" means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, the name was actually an adaptation of the word 'Tihuan' or 'Tiju\u00e1n' in the Kumeyaay language, the name of a nearby Kumeyaay settlement and whose meaning is disputed.In 1848, as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War with the United States, Mexico lost all of Alta California. The majority of the 1,000 Hispanic families living in Alta California stayed there, though some moved south to remain inside Mexico. Because of this Tijuana gained a different purpose on the international border. The area had been populated by ranchers, but Tijuana developed a new social economic structure. These were farming and livestock grazing, plus as a transit area for prospectors.\n\n\n=== 1889\u20131915: Town established ===\nUrban settlement began in 1889, when descendants of Santiago Arg\u00fcello and August\u00edn Olvera entered an agreement to begin developing the city of Tijuana. The date of the agreement, July 11, 1889, is recognized as the founding of the city. Tijuana saw its future in tourism from the beginning. From the late 19th century to the first few decades of the 20th century, the city attracted large numbers of Californians coming for trade and entertainment. The California land boom of the 1880s led to the first big wave of tourists, who were called \"excursionists\" and came looking for echoes of the famous novel \"Ramona\" by Helen Hunt Jackson.\nIn 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, revolutionaries claiming loyalty to Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n took over the city for shortly over a month. Federal troops then arrived. Assisted by the \"defensores de Tijuana\", they routed the revolutionaries, who fled north and were promptly arrested by the United States Army.\nThe Panama-California Exposition of 1915 brought many visitors to the nearby California city of San Diego. Tijuana attracted these tourists with a Feria T\u00edpica Mexicana \u2013 Typical Mexican Fair. This included curio shops, regional food, thermal baths, horse racing and boxing.\n\n\n=== 1916\u20131935: Gambling and drinking destination ===\nThe first professional race track opened in January 1916, just south of the border gate. It was almost immediately destroyed by the great \"Hatfield rainmaker\" flood of 1916. Rebuilt in the general area, it ran horse races until the new Agua Caliente track opened in 1929, several miles south and across the river on higher ground.\nLegal drinking and gambling attracted U.S nationals in the 1920s during Prohibition. The Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area became the city's tourist center, with casinos and the Hotel Caesar's, birthplace of the Caesar salad.\nIn 1925, the city by presidential decree changed his name to   ciudad Zaragoza, but its name reverted to Tijuana in 1929.\nIn 1928, the Agua Caliente Touristic Complex was opened, including hotel, spa, dog-track, private airport, golf course and gambling casino. A year later, the new Agua Caliente Racetrack joined the complex. During the eight years it operated, the Agua Caliente hotel, casino and spa achieved a near mythical status, with Hollywood stars and gangsters flying in and playing. Rita Hayworth was discovered there. Musical nightclub productions were broadcast over the radio. A singer known as \"la Faraona\" got shot in a love-triangle and gave birth to the myth of a beautiful lady ghost. Remnants of the Agua Caliente casino can be seen in the outdoor swimming pool and the \"minarete\" (actually a former incinerator chimney) nearby the southern end of Avenida Sanchez Taboada, on the grounds of what is now the Lazaro Cardenas educational complex.\n\n\n=== 1935\u20131965: Tourism broadens ===\nIn 1935, President C\u00e1rdenas decreed an end to gambling and casinos in Baja California, and the Agua Caliente complex faltered, then closed. In 1939, it was reopened as a junior high school (now, Preparatoria L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas). The buildings themselves were torn down in the 1970s and replaced by modern scholastic architecture.\nWith increased tourism and a large number of Mexican citizens relocating to Tijuana, the city's population grew from 21,971 to 65,364 between 1940 and 1950.\n\nWith the decline of nightlife and tourism in the 1950s, the city restructured its tourist industry, by promoting a more family-oriented scene. Tijuana developed a greater variety of attractions and activities to offer its visitors.\n\n\n=== 1965\u20132001: The city matures ===\nIn 1965 the Mexican federal government launched the Border Industrialization Program to attract foreign investment. Tijuana and other border cities became attractive for foreign companies to open maquiladoras (factories), and the Tijuana economy started to diversify. Manufacturing jobs attracted workers from other parts of Mexico and the city's population grew from less than half a million in 1980 to almost 1 million in 1985.\nIn 1972, work began on the first concrete channeling of the Tijuana River; previously the river would flood across a wide plain east and southeast of downtown, inundating an area of wood, cardboard and metal shacks called Cartolandia (\u201cPaperland\u201d).  The project removed the shacks and added 1.8 million sq. m. of usable land, on which the Zona R\u00edo was built. With the 1981 opening of the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana mall and the 1982 Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT), Zona R\u00edo became the new commercial center of a modern Tijuana, and with its new boulevards with monument-filled glorietas (roundabouts), reminiscent of the grand Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, the city created the new image and allure of a modern, large city, rather than just a border town focused on tourism and vice.In 1994, PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana while making an appearance in the plaza of Lomas Taurinas, a neighborhood nestled in a valley near Centro. The shooter was caught and imprisoned, but doubts remain about who the mastermind might have been.\n\n\n=== 2001\u20132011: Violence and decline of US tourism ===\nAfter 9/11, tighter US border controls resulted in hours-long waits to return to the US. The number of US visitors dropped sharply due to this factor, as well as subsequent drug violence.Around 2008, thousands of Tijuana's elite bought houses in and moved to Bonita and Eastlake in Chula Vista, California to escape violence, kidnapping and other crimes taking place during that period. An article in The Los Angeles Times reported that the emigration to San Diego County has transformed the demographic and cultural character of some cities to a degree.\n\n\n=== 2011\u2013present: Tijuana strengthens ===\nIn recent years, Tijuana has become an important city of commerce and migration for Mexico and US. In spite of the violence and border crossing issues, the city has received a large number of tourists from US, China, Japan and the south of Mexico. Thanks to the realization of cultural and business festivals, the city has improved its image before the world, standing out as a competitive city for investment. Currently, the commercial and business sector is committed to the boom in the gastronomic industry, craft beer, entertainment and real estate, as well as medical tourism, to attract visitors and investors.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTijuana is the westernmost city in Mexico, and consequently in Latin America, and the second largest city of northern Mexico. Located about 210 kilometers (130 mi) west of the state capital, Mexicali, the city is bordered to the north by the cities of Imperial Beach, and the San Diego neighborhoods of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, California. To the southwest of the city is Rosarito Beach, while to the south is unincorporated territory of Tijuana Municipality. The city is nestled among hills, canyons, and gullies. The central part of the city lies in a valley through which flows the channeled Tijuana River.\nHousing development in the Tijuana Hills has led to eradication of many seasonal mountain streams. This lack of natural drainage makes places within the city vulnerable to landslides during the rainy season. The varied terrain of Tijuana gives the city elevation extremes that range from sea level to 790 meters (2,590 ft).\nTijuana is noted for its rough terrain, which includes many canyons, steep hills, and mesas. Among noted canyons in Tijuana are Canyon K and Canyon Johnson. Large Tijuana hills include Red Hill (Cerro Colorado) and Hill of the Bees (Cerro de las Abejas) in the eastern part of the city.\nThe city is located near the terminus of the Tijuana River and within the Tijuana River Basin. The Tijuana River is an intermittent river, 195 km (121 mi) long, on the Pacific coast of northern Baja California in Mexico and Southern California in the United States. It drains an arid area along the California\u2013Baja California border, flowing through Mexico for most of its course and then crossing the border for the last 8 km (5 mi) of its course where it forms an estuary that empties into the ocean. The river's lower reaches harbor the last undeveloped coastal wetlands in San Diego County, and some of the last in Southern California, amidst a highly urbanized environment at the southern city limits of Imperial Beach.\nAs downtown Tijuana was built at the bottom of the river valley, the district is subject to seasonal flooding created by drain-off from the Tijuana Hills. During this time, east-bound portions of the Via Rapida (east-west highway) may be blocked off by the Tijuana Police due to hazardous conditions.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city's skyscraper history is relatively recent. Some of the first highrise building complexes constructed in the city were the twin towers of Grand Hotel Tijuana. Tijuana experienced a building boom that was brought to a halt by the Great Recession. Among buildings that succumbed to the time period was the Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico that would have been located in Playas and reached 98 m (322 ft). Currently the tallest building, and soon to be the largest complex in footage, New City Residential reaches 102 m (335 ft). Overall, the city maintains 33 completed structures with other proposed and under-construction skyscrapers.\n\nThe Tijuana skyline is the fifth largest skyline in Mexico and is located in the Zona Rio and to a smaller extent, Playas de Tijuana. In the Zona Rio the buildings are concentrated on the Tijuana River, lined parallel to the river; and on the edges of the Tijuana Country Club. In Playas the high rises are currently focused on the coast. Recent construction on high rises has begun in the aforementioned areas, as buildings such as New City Residential and Grand Hotel Tijuana have been developed and taken prominent places in the skyline as the tallest buildings. From Tijuana's skyline the San Diego skyline can also be seen, although the reverse is mostly not true on account of the high hills surrounding central Tijuana.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Tijuana is divided into eight administrative boroughs, or Delegaciones. The Tijuana metropolitan area occupies all of borough seats. The boroughs are in turn divided into colonias or ejidos. These boroughs offer administrative services such as urban planning, civil registry, inspection, verification, public works and community development and are served by a delegado.\n\nCentro \u2014 \"Delegaci\u00f3n Centro\" includes the old downtown (Zona Centro), new business district (Zona R\u00edo), red light district (Zona Norte), and other adjacent neighborhoods (\"zonas\"). This is the historical midpoint of Tijuana; the municipal palace is located here as well as most of the tourist zones, such as Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n and the business district. The Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT for CEntro CUltural de Tijuana) is located here as well as the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana, until recently the largest mall in the state, within the Zona Rio.\nCerro Colorado \u2014 The Cerro Colorado (\"Red Hill\") is located here and it is surrounded by houses. Because of its height many of the area's antennae for radio and television stations are located on its peak.\nLa Mesa \u2014 This is where the Morelos Park, the largest public park in the city, is located, as well as the retail and transit hub Cinco y Diez, Plaza Mundo Divertido, the new Macroplaza and the CETYS University.\nOtay Centenario \u2014 This borough was created in 2014 by merging Mesa de Otay and Centenario boroughs. In this borough sits the Tijuana International Airport.  The Tijuana campus of the Autonomous University of Baja California and the Technologico are also located here as well as many maquiladoras. This is the borough with the largest number of factories and maquiladoras. Its largest colony is Ciudad Industrial (\"Industrial City\"). Three of the city's most important streets, Boulevard Bellas Artes, Boulevard Industrial and Fed 2, are located here.  This delegacion contains the Otay Mesa entry to the United States and the Friendship Park (Parque de la amistad).\nPlayas de Tijuana \u2014 This is the westernmost borough of the city bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the United States border on the north. This is where the beaches of Tijuana are located (hence the name) and it is also one of the two exits to the south towards Rosarito and Ensenada.\nLa Presa \u2014 literally \"'the dam'\", this is the largest borough in size and the Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez Dam is located within its limits, hence its name. The new Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 and the Tijuana-Tecate freeways run through it.\nSan Antonio de los Buenos \u2014 This is mostly a residential area although it also has two industrial parks.\nSanchez Taboada \u2014 Like the previous borough this is mostly a residential area, but within its borders are located many \"maquiladoras\" specially at Pacific Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTijuana's climate is a semi-arid (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh), with about 231 mm (9.09 in) of annual precipitation, and generally mild to warm weather year-round. It has characteristics of the Mediterranean climate (Csa) found to the immediate north, with most of the annual precipitation falling in the winter, between the months of November and March.\n\nBetween November and March, storms originate from fronts entering off of the Pacific Ocean. January is the wettest month of the year for the city and during this time a periodic event, similar to June Gloom, is observed created by marine layer. January is the coolest month, during which temperatures average 13.6 \u00b0C (56.5 \u00b0F). In the city April signifies the end of winter and the start of Santa Ana winds. Though the daytime highs are generally around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), heat waves can reach up to 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F). The hottest months in the city are August and September, during which temperatures average 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Summers are by far the driest time of year since influences from the California Current and the North Pacific High suppress the formation of rainfall caused by the North American Monsoon. As in coastal Southern California, air pollution sometimes occurs during periods of temperature inversion, especially during summer and fall, but (unlike Mexico City) is seldom severe and in recent years has lessened due to cleaner car engines.Frost and snow are rare phenomena in the city as temperatures are usually well above freezing. Yet, in December 1967, snow fell in the city and in January 2007 feather light snow fell in the east of the city. However, excessive amounts of snow fall have never been recorded in the city. On February 14, 2008 a winter storm caused an unusual snowfall in the upper reaches of the hills of the city.\nThe record low temperature recorded in the city was \u22126 \u00b0C (21 \u00b0F), while the highest was 49 \u00b0C (120 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nTijuana has a diverse cosmopolitan population which includes migrants from other parts of Mexico and from all over the world. Tijuana has one of Mexico's largest Asian populations, predominantly consisting of Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese immigrants. Tijuana also has a large and rapidly growing population of United States citizens, mostly from Southern California.  Many Latin Americans, notably Cubans, and Guatemalans, have made Tijuana their home. The city also has many Lebanese, Italian, French, Spanish citizens. Recently, the city has received a large influx of Haitian immigrants.\n\nThe majority of Tijuana's migrant Mexican population hail from Sinaloa, Michoac\u00e1n, Jalisco, Oaxaca, and the Federal District. Because of the diversity of Mexico and the influx of immigrants from almost every region in the country, there are no accurate estimates on ethnicity or race of the current population. The heavy influx of immigrants to the city and municipality of Tijuana has led to job creation in the form of over 700 twin-plant (maquiladora) factories, which serve as the basis of employment for the majority of the working-class people in northern Mexico.  The high poverty level in Tijuana is attributed to the city's \"magnet status\" for people who have come from the poorer south of the nation and citizens from other nations seeking to escape from extreme poverty.  Tijuana holds a status that provides the possibility of employment as well as higher education and the dream of crossing the border.  Tijuana and Baja California in general have much stronger economies and higher incomes than other Mexican cities along the United States border, as well as more moderate weather.\nTijuana today is one of the fastest growing cities in Mexico with an average of 80,000 people moving to Tijuana yearly.  In terms of area, the city grows by approximately three hectares a day, mostly east and south as the city is mostly built out to the beach already with the exception of some canyons.  Along with settlements separated from Tijuana proper and other communities unimproved land, big business moves in providing supermarkets and retail to marginal areas, along with paved roads.  The city experiences the construction of 26,000 new settlers a year that has led to the unregulated, illegal squatter homes that takes place in the hills and valleys of ever expanding Tijuana, most of these areas are still without city services like sidewalks, paving, streetlights, and public transit. This is an ongoing process: as older and existing squatter areas are brought into the city services, more marginal areas become occupied by squatters.\nSquatter areas are home to displaced and uprooted people, among them the indigenous and poverty stricken, as well as migrants deported from the USA, many of whom are also without Mexican citizenship.  In recent years, working-class suburban housing estates have sprung up in the fringes to provide a sense of safety and land ownership.  These suburbs enable young families to isolate their families from the violence of the drug war and squatter areas.  These outlying communities tend to be much better equipped than their squatter counterparts.  Nevertheless, some remote areas are drug plantations for narcotics, and delinquency has spread to areas once considered safe havens.  These issues occasionally come to light in the newspapers.\nNational Population Council (CONAPO) data has estimated that by 2030, growth rates maintaining, the city will become the second largest in Mexico and anchor to the fourth largest metropolitan area in Mexico. The suburban sprawl observed in Tijuana leaves the downtown and beach areas relatively affluent.\n\nWhile the INEGI Census 2010 placed Tijuana's population at 1.3 million, only two percent more than in 2005 Census, Tijuana City Council estimates from 2010 place the population closer to two million, at 1.6 million. As funding for cities is based on the populace of the city, the Council worries about receiving adequate funds to provide for the needs of the city.  The population discrepancies may be explained by a few factors.  Shanty towns that have not been rasterized and an undercount, people having left Tijuana for United States, and people leaving Tijuana for the interior of Mexico due to the intensification of the drug war, and suburbanization outside city limits but still inside the municipality.  Tijuana, because of the dreams of border crossers, and its relatively higher wages compared to the rest of Mexico, naturally attracts immigrants.  Since an improvement in security since 2011, the population of Tijuana as reflected in the 2015 Mexican census is expected to return to its normal growth curve; the great reduction in violence should make the settlement of Tijuana an attractive option again versus fringe valleys, nevertheless exact figures from the census await.\nAccording to the Second Census of Population and Housing of the year 2010 conducted by the INEGI (National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics) the municipality of Tijuana has 1,559,683 inhabitants within 879 km2, the city or settlement of Tijuana only covers \u2154 of that area.  While the metropolitan area of Tijuana (1392 km2), composed of Tijuana Municipality and Rosarito Beach Municipality, has 1,751,302 inhabitants. Tecate Municipality, adjacent to Tijuana Municipality, has not yet been considered by the government as part of the metropolitan area.  However, there is great economic and cultural exchange between the cities regions though there are still expanses of rural land. As Tijuana grows, many of its suburbs have been built increasingly inland, and in the direction of Tecate; Valley of the Palms is a large planned city between the two.\nAs of 2005 the large majority of the city's population, 96%, adhere to the beliefs of Christianity. The denominations are further divided into followers of Catholicism \u2013 61% \u2013 and of Protestantism \u2013 35%.  While other beliefs occupying a 4% margin in the city include Taoism (among other Asian and European religions), atheism and agnosticism is also found.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nTijuana is the birthplace and base of the Tijuana Cartel.  From 2007 through 2010, Tijuana experienced an unusually high level of violent crime related to gang violence, in part derived from the Mexican drug war and human trafficking.  Homicides peaked in 2010, when 844 people were killed, compared with 355 in 2004 and 349 in the first eight months of 2011. Reportedly, the wave of violence resulted from a turf war as the administration of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n weakened the local Arellano F\u00e9lix cartel; violence slowed when the larger Sinaloa cartel took control.During peak years of violent crime in the city, gun battles between rival cartels, and between cartels and the police, erupted in public. In April 2008, police found 1,500 shell casings on various streets after one battle left 13 suspected drug traffickers dead. In 2009 and depending on the source, Tijuana Municipality experienced either 556 or 1,118 murders, mostly as a result of the drug war.There were 492 murders in 2013, a 48% increase in the homicide rate between 2012 and 2013. This was the highest number of murders since 2010. By the end of 2017, the number of murders in Tijuana increased to 1,744, which was almost double those in 2016.As of 2018, Tijuana had the highest per capita rate for homicides in the world at 138 murders per 100,000 people.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Region ===\n\nAt present the parties with greater presence in Tijuana are the National Action Party (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). The PAN has been the dominant party in the city for 20 years. Historically the PRI had been the dominant party in regional politics, until 1989 when the PAN began to dominate the city, until yet again, in 2004, PRI began regaining prominence and won the Mayor's Office.\nLess prominent parties also maintain relations with the dominant parties. These other parties, with less presence include the New Alliance Party (PANAL), Social Encounter Party (PES), and Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Allied with the PAN at the state and local level under the Alliance for Baja California are the Social Encounter Party (PES) and New Alliance Party (PANAL). Allied with the PRI at the state and local level under the \"Alliance for Better Living\" are the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) and Baja California State Party (PEBC).\n\n\n=== International ===\nTijuana's importance and rise to a global city has led to its recognition among countries worldwide. In addition to international cultural recognition, Tijuana has received political recognition and is a developing a political center currently host to eight consulates from European, Asian, and North American countries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\n\nTijuana is a large manufacturing center, and in addition to tourism, it serves as a cornerstone of the city economy. In the past decade alone, Tijuana became the medical device manufacture capital of the North American continent, surpassing previous leader Minneapolis - Saint Paul.The city's proximity to Southern California and its large, skilled, diverse, and relatively inexpensive workforce make it an attractive city for foreign companies looking to establish extensive industrial parks composed of assembly plants that are called maquiladoras, even more so than other cities in the US-Mexican border zone, taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to export products. At its peak, in 2001 Tijuana had roughly 820 of these 'maquiladoras'. Foreign and domestic companies employ thousands of employees in these plants, usually in assembly-related labor. Such jobs are not demanding but typically offer above average salaries for Mexico, with most maqiladoras jobs beginning at Mex$100 per day (about 5 US dollars, as of September 2016), significantly above the Mexican minimum wage of Mex$57.46 (about 3 US dollars, as of September 2016). Companies that have set up maquiladoras in Tijuana include Lanix, Hyundai, Sony, Vortec, BMW, Vizio, Toyota, Dell, Samsung, Kodak, Matsushita/Panasonic, GE, Nabisco, Ford, Microsoft, Cemex, Zonda, Philips, Pioneer, Airbus, Plantronics, Siemens Mexico, Jaguar, Pall Medical, Tara, Sanyo and Volkswagen. Many of the maquiladoras are located in the Otay Mesa and Florido sections of Tijuana.\nEconomic development has its central business district at Zona R\u00edo, which together, with the corridor along Blvd. Agua Caliente (the extension of Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n), contains the majority of the higher-end office space in the city.\n\n\n=== Tourist economy and entertainment ===\nTijuana also relies on tourism for a major part of its revenue. About 300,000 visitors cross by foot or car from the San Ysidro point of entry in the United States every day. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs, and shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are part of the draw for the city's tourists, many located within walking distance of the border. The city's tourist centers include Downtown Tijuana including the nightlife hot spots around La Sexta, Avenida Revolucion, souvenir shopping at the Mercado de Artesan\u00edas and Plaza Viva Tijuana, Tijuana's Cultural Center (CECUT) and neighboring Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana shopping center, and the city's best known vices, in the form of its legal Red Light District and gambling (Agua Caliente). Mexico's drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college aged Southern Californians who tend to stay on Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n.\nTijuana is also known for its red-light district Zona Norte (also referred to as La Coahuila after one of its main streets) with legal prostitution in strip clubs and on the street. The strip clubs are typically full-contact, meaning the dancers let patrons fondle them. Many dancers also sell their sexual services. In a 1999 estimation, there were 15,000 women engaged in prostitution in Tijuana outside of clubs and brothels.Tijuana has many pharmacies that target visitors from the United States, which sell some medicines without prescriptions and/or at much lower costs than in the U.S. Many medications still require a Mexican prescription, which can be obtained from adjacent doctors' offices. People filling up prescriptions for drugs classified in the US as Schedule II or Schedule III have found it more difficult to locate such medications, and the purchase of pseudoephedrine also has become restricted by Tijuana pharmacies, just as in the U.S. To fill a prescription in Tijuana for any drug covered by the US Controlled Substances Act  and legally bring it into the United States requires a prescription from the United States for re-import.  Americans can import up to a 90-day supply of non-controlled medications for personal use to the USA from Mexico and other countries.\nBusinesses such as auto detailing, medical and dental services and plastic surgery are heavily marketed, and are usually much less expensive than in the U.S.\nTijuana is headquarters for Mexico's largest gambling concern, Grupo Caliente, which operates the only casinos in the city, more than twenty branches.Tourists are sometimes robbed by municipal police.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nPlaza Rio Tijuana is a large regional mall anchored by Cin\u00e9polis, Sanborns, S\u00faper DAX and Sears.\nAll across the city, there are dozens of plazas comerciales, which may be strip malls or small enclosed or open-air centers, with a combination of any or all of the following anchors:\n\none of the 26 Tijuana branches of the small department store Coppel,\na supermarket or hypermarket,\na cin\u00e9polis or cinemex multicinema,\na branch of the electronics and motorcycle retailer ElektraAn important concentration of plazas is in the Cinco y Diez around an eponymous intersection, named for a former American-style five and dime store that was located there. It is also a major hub for public transit. Plaza Carrousel, with its namesake merry-go-round, is located here.\nCostco, Sam's Club, and Walmart each have multiple branches across the city.\nTraditional markets with vendors include the large Mercado Hidalgo in Zona R\u00edo, smaller neighborhood markets and the Mercado Municipal downtown.\nTijuana was the headquarters of 14-store Dorian's department store chain until its demise in 2009; most were converted to Sears stores.\n\n\n=== Culinary ===\nTijuana, along with the nearby Valle de Guadalupe, has recently become a culinary hotspot due to its Baja Med cuisine, including chefs such as Javier Plascencia, but also for its tacos, other street food, food trucks, coffee houses and artisanal beer.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTijuana is home to many private Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and High Schools as well as nationally high ranked colleges and universities. Notable primary and secondary schools include Metropolitan, Instituto M\u00e9xico, Instituto Cumbres, President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas School, Agua Caliente School Center High, Polit\u00e9cnico de Baja California(CLUB DE QU\u00cdMICA), Jos\u00e9 Fimbres Moreno School and the State High School, and Ignacio Ram\u00edrez School located in Cerro Colorado. These schools maintain recognition for their demands and high standards.\nTijuana maintains multiple higher education institutions. These include the Autonomous University of Baja California, Tijuana (UABC), Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Tijuana (ITT), Universidad Iberoamericana (UIA-Tijuana), CETYS Universidad, Universidad Xochicalco, and University of the Californias. Other colleges include Tijuana University Center, Tijuana University of Technology, Graduate Center of the Northwest, and the University of Professional Development. The city is the seat of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), an institution of scientific research and higher education, specializing in the study of the problems in the border region between Mexico and the United States. In August 2009, Metropolitan UABC opened in Valle de Las Palmas, in the Tijuana metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Culture and contemporary life ==\nMany foreigners travel to Tijuana to drink and dance, buy prescription drugs, purchase bootleg brand-name clothing, timepieces, and other personal accessories found globally, as well as manufactured and hand-crafted local curiosities. Locals and regular tourists avoid hassles by visiting the clubs at Plaza Fiesta or other areas of the Zona R\u00edo without the crowds, heavy marketing, and occasional tourist misbehavior or outright lawbreaking common on the Revoluci\u00f3n strip. However, Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n has been known for its proliferation of nightclub shows, primarily catering to casual tourists. While still an entertaining town with an enjoyable atmosphere, some locals and tourists feel it has lost an \"anything goes\" atmosphere, that was dangerous to locals, tourists, and the tourism industry.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nAs Tijuana matured from a tourist-oriented border town into one of Mexico's largest cities, the 1982 opening of the Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT) marked a milestone. CECUT's mission was to strengthening Tijuana's image, both to US visitors and to Mexicans, as a destination for culture and not only shopping and vice. The center includes an OMNIMAX cinema showing IMAX films, the Museum of the Californias, contemporary art exhibition halls, a restaurant, caf\u00e9, bookstore,  and other cultural facilities.\nLa Casa de la Cultura cultural center comprises a school, a theater, and a public library, and teaches dance, painting, music, plastic arts, photography and languages.\nOther cultural venues include the Instituto Municipal de Arte y Cultura (Municipal Institute of Art and Culture), the Tijuana Wax Museum, the Museo El Trompo (Trompo Museum), and El Foro, the former Jai Alai Palace, that is now a concert venue. Concerts are also held at the Estadio Caliente stadium, Hip\u00f3dromo Agua Caliente Racetrack, and at the \"Audiorama\" at the Museo El Trompo children's museum of science and technology.The Tijuana Country Club (Club Campestre de Tijuana) has many affluent members and a famous golf course and also functions as an entertainment and events venue. Tijuana also has a large Rotary Club.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\nParque Morelos has a small zoo and park space; Parque de la Amistad in Otay Centenario has a small pond, and a running and dirt-bike track. Parque Teniente Guerrero is a downtown park with a public library and weekend entertainment by clowns.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nTijuana's nightlife scene is one of the city's strongest attractions. The area surrounding \"La Sexta\", the intersection at Calle Sexta and Av. Revoluci\u00f3n, is now a major hub of new bars and dance clubs. Zona Rio, Tijuana's new Downtown, is home to some of the city's finest restaurants and bars. Another capstone of Tijuana's entertainment offerings is its adult nightlife industry, which includes the city's red light district as well as less conspicuous adult entertainment venues.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nTijuana also has a very active and independent artist community whose internationally recognized work has earned Tijuana the title of \"one of the most important new cultural meccas\", according to Newsweek, an exhibition of Tijuana's current art scene, is being curated by the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and is traveling across the USA in 2006 and 2007. Art collectives like Bulbo and film production like Palenque Filmaciones explore the use of film like the award-winning Tijuana Makes Me Happy, media like television bulbo TV and print \"bulbo PRESS\", to show different realities of Tijuana out of Mexico. In 2004, Tijuana earned international acclaim for an art exhibition displayed on the cement banks of the Tijuana River and along the Mexico/U.S. border fence in Otay Mesa.\nGraffiti is widespread in Tijuana. They can range from free-hand writing in spray can and marker form, often carrying social or sexual commentary in English or Spanish, pictures in wheatpaste and stencils, consisting of stenciled renderings of personalities crucial to Hispanic culture from past and present eras, such as television news announcers or stars, but also extending to images of artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed. Graffiti in Tijuana may seem at first to consist largely of simplistic tags and thus not as technically evolved, colorful, or accepted in the mainstream as the \"pieces\" of graffiti scenes of the United States, Europe, or Japan, but large, colorful graffiti murals adorn walls from both native Tijuanan artists as well as visiting graffiti writers, especially from California. The Tijuanan art pieces show as much prowess and skill as those made by their more renowned U.S. counterparts, although illicit graffiti are strongly discouraged by the Tijuana government, as in other major metropolitan areas.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nSince the decade of the 1920s, Tijuana has excelled in the musical field, thanks to the first groups of ranchera music that began to set the tourist establishments in the area with the visit of foreigners, including the former Casino Agua Caliente.\nRock music was very popular and popular among young people in the mid-50s, leaving the ranch rhythm aside years ago. Another event that added the arrival of Rock to Tijuana was the visit of the African-American pianist and guitarist, Gene Ross, who came to play at the Convoy Club on Revolution Avenue. The presence of this artist was the beginning of the rock scene in the region that marked a new style in the country.54 Some groupings of the nascent Mexican rock began, an example of which was \"The Tijuana Five\", who made some covers in Spanish of Anglo-Saxon successes.\nJavier Batiz founded in 1957 he founded a group called \"Los TJ's\" with which he collected musical influences that were received in the Mexican border cities of black music, blues and R&B from people like T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin 'Wolf, James Brown, among others. Later he would start his solo career in the rest of the country and participating in some bands in Mexico City.\nDuring the 60s, the American trumpeter Herb Alpert, in a visit to the bullfights made in the old Bullfight, found musical inspiration so after the recording of his single \"The Lonely Bull\", which was a radio hit in 1962. With the success, he decided to make a casting and formed \"The Tijuana Brass\", with whom he toured and had a presentation on television. It was a musical collaboration with artists from Los Angeles, with style called \"Tijuana Marimba\u00b4s Brass\". The band was dissolved in 1969 but they continued with some presentations under the name of T.J.B. 55\nAt the end of the 60s and during the 70s, rock and roll still had great acceptance in the public. In those years bands such as \"The Moonlights\" had national and international recognition, who achieved successes such as \"Tijuana Funky\" or \"Are you\"; the \"Rockin Devils\", recognized for their Spanish cover of \"Bule Bule\", which achieved international success. The Roble Cinema, La Caba\u00f1a club and Flamingos club, would be some of the main stages of the decade for musical performances in the city.56\nIn the 70s, rock groups and musicians experienced government rejection and censorship for the lyrics of the songs. Romantic music took a boom and from there came bands like \"The Battle of Tijuana\", \"Los Solitarios\", \"Los Terr\u00edcolas\", \"Old Memories\", \"Tito Pantoja and his friends\", \"Ritmo 7\", \"Los Old Friends \",\" California Brass \"and \"Los Corazones Solitarios\", among others.\nIn the late 80s, Antonio De Carlo, was recognized as a revelation artist at the OTI Festival, having a successful career during the 90s, with songs such as \"In A Thousand Pieces\", \"A Pecho Discovery\", \"Revolution\" and \"Like It Hurts \". Lynda also gained national relevance in pop, achieving hits in songs like \"Lost Heart\", \"Tell\", \"A Thousand for an Hour\", among others.\nDespite the downturn in rock artists for some years, in the 90s Tijuana No! emerged, returning a bit of the genre to the city. They also incorporated ska, punk and reggae. \"No\" would be the first album released, from which successes like \"Pobre de ti\", which had Julieta Venegas as a vocalist, would emerge. Later the singer began her solo career already in the 00s of the 21st century. Her musical career reached the recording of six studio albums, and she won two Grammys, six Latin Grammys, six MTV Latin America and two Latin Music Billboard.\nThe city continued to be a hotbed of important rock bands, among them, especially at the international level, Specimen, other bands and prominent artists could be Ohtli, Nona Delichas, Canseco, Sonoro 2 and Headlongs. Electronic music boomed in the 90s, Murcof and the Nortec Collective, entered the scene and began to gain worldwide recognition for merging electronic music with northern and band music. This group was enriched with the visual contribution of designers and videographers who, under the same concept, provided images to this musical proposal.\nRegarding Mexican regional music, some groups of the northern genre were emerging, highlighting Los Tucanes de Tijuana, who since the 80s began their musical career until popularizing songs such as \"La Chona\", \"El Tucanazo\", \"La Chica Sexy\", among others. The Agua Caliente Band, Explosi\u00f3n Norte\u00f1a, among others, would be a new generation of Mexican popular music artists.\nAmong other things, Tijuana has been the inspiration for the birthplace of Nortec music style and Ruidoson, resulting in a very large and active electronic music scene where groups and artists like Los Macuanos, Maria y Jose, Siberium, Hidhawk and Harpocrates emerged. Tijuana also enjoys a large base of support in many other musical scenes such as mexican hip hop, reggae, hardcore, punk, black metal and house music. Famous musicians are from Tijuana including the pop-rock singer-songwriter Lynda Thomas and Vanessa Zamora and international indie punk bands like Delux and Los Kung-Fu Monkeys.\nTo promote the cultural development in children and youth of Tijuana, since 1996 the Tijuana Youth Symphony (SJT) has been promoted, which promotes education and musical training through instrument practices, music reading and public concerts. In addition, Tijuana has an opera season. There are also several musical festivals throughout the year, among which the Latin American Guitar Festival, Mainly Mozart Binacional, and the International Exhibition of contemporary dance \"Bodies in Transit\" stand out.\nTijuana is home to the Baja California Orchestra, one of the most prestigious and solid artistic institutions in northwestern Mexico, which was nominated for the Latin Grammy in the category of best classical album by the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Inc ., with the album Tango kills Danz\u00f3n kills Tango. This phonogram was distinguished as 'Best Classical Album of the year 2001' by the Mexican Union of Theater and Music Chroniclers. Currently, it maintains an annual season, offering symphonic and chamber music concerts in the most important forums of Tijuana and Baja California.\nAlready in the new century, many local bands have emerged, from all musical genres, some of them staying with local and national recognition. Highlights Nosis, High Slogan, Go Future, Ramona, The Children of the Saint, Among Deserts, Ziruela, Palos Verdes, Edwin, among others. Each of them have contributed and tried to revive the musical talent for which Tijuana has always been characterized.\nMusical clubs along the Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area and others often cater to a diverse range of tastes by offering nightly variations on musical fare, such as new wave music one night, and punk rock bands on the next. Some European metal bands whose members cannot perform in the United States due to prior felony convictions in their own countries play music festivals in Tijuana for fans from both Mexico and the United States.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city is home to the Tijuana Zonkeys professional basketball team of the CIBACOPA basketball league. The team is composed mostly of players from Mexico and plays from February to July in the Municipal Auditorium.\nThe city has a strong tradition of association football, Club Tijuana began playing in the Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n on the 2011/12 season, winning the 2012 Apertura title. They play their matches at the Estadio Caliente, a new 33,000 seat stadium. The team's mascot is the Xoloitzcuintle, a famous Mexican hairless dog.\nTijuana also has a long history of producing many world champion professional boxers, such as Antonio Margarito and Erik Morales.\n\n\n=== Stadiums ===\nEstadio Caliente\n\nThe stadium is the Estadio Caliente, match venue for Club Tijuana, a Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n football team. It is located in the Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Baja California (Mexico). Caliente Homes Stadium, is a multi-purpose center in Tijuana. It is mainly used for football matches, has a seating capacity of 21,000 spectators.  Opened in June 2008, according to the work schedule. It was a significant reason for Tijuana Club was promoted to the M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n; FEMEXFUT requires participating teams should have a stadium with a seating capacity of over 15,000. It is at this stage the U-17 FIBA Americas Championship 2009 was held bound for Nigeria. Was introduced in M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n during the Apertura 2011 tournament of the Mexican Football Federation.Estadio Chevron\n\nThe Chevron Stadium  is the home of the Toros de Tijuana. It opened in 1977 and housed the Colts missing Tijuana Mexican Pacific League. Subsequently, the stadium was used for football matches. For 2004, professional baseball returned, now with a franchise LMB under the name of Toros de Tijuana, which, the following year, changed its name to Colts as it had been known previously. At first the facility was called Cerro Colorado Stadium, due to its location at the foot of the hill of that name. With the return of baseball, chain supermarkets Calimax bought the naming rights to the stadium.  In 2004, the first season of Toros, the fans filled the stadium for most matches.  On April 4, 2013, the stadium was remodeled, marking the beginning of a new era for Toros de Tijuana.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\n\n\n==== Water ====\nThe Tijuana State Commission of Public Services (CESPT) supplies the city with its water, while the city receives its electricity from La Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE).\nIn 2019, due to extremely low water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir, CESPT began a city-wide water rationing scheme. This rationing scheme would divide Tijuana and nearby Rosarito into 5 zones. Each zone would be cut-off from the water supply on a rotating schedule of 4 days with water and 1 day without water. This scheme was expected to last for at least 2 months until the water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir were improved.\n\n\n==== Wastewater ====\nThe International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) developed, as a joint project of the USA and Mexico in the mid-1980s following substantial environmental studies, treats 25 million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Tijuana River; directly pumped across the border from the central collection point in Mexico. When the river is flowing, the diversion system of the plant begins operating and diverts up to about 12-13mgd to the IWTP. The total amount of water being diverted must not exceed 25 mgd, based on a monthly average decided upon by permit conditions, although the IWTP can treat sustained flows up to 45mgd daily and peaks of 70mgd for a short period. The diversion system regularly sends approximately six to eight million gallons of water daily to the IWTP. The plant is currently being upgraded to include a secondary treatment facility.\nThe city also four to five decentralize units that are part of the Tijuana/Rosarito Potable Water and Wastewater Master Plan. This plan was required as part of Public Law 106-457, put into order November 7, 2000, which was written to allow the Bajagua project to move forward. The master plan was a binational collaborative effort by EPA and CESPT and addressed San Diego-Tijuana's needs for the next 20 years. The plants are intended to treat approximately 5mgd each, to tertiary levels and provide the reclaimed water to the surrounding areas for agriculture, industry etc. There are several issues that they are facing: no infrastructure to convey the reclaimed water to customers and inadequate groundwater recharge infrastructure.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications ====\nTijuana's telephonic system operates under area code 664, but it is not the same area code 664 that is part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) because Mexico is not one of the countries represented in the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) where the country code is 1. So, to dial a phone number from San Diego to Tijuana requires an international access code and Mexico's Country Code, 52, before dialing the area code and the number.  It is similar for anyone calling from Tijuana to the United States.\nTelephonic landlines in Tijuana are provided by the company Telnor; other companies include Axtel, Izzi Telecom and Alestra. Popular cell phone carriers in the city-region include Movistar, Telcel, and AT&T Mexico. Many U.S. carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile offer free roaming in Mexico and it is possible to connect to U.S. based cell phone towers in many northern parts of the city. Cell phones also have historic usage in Tijuana as the first cellular call in Mexico was made in Tijuana in 1989.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nTijuana is a major gateway to the interior of Mexico to which it is connected by air and road directly, and by sea via the ports of Ensenada and San Diego. Within Tijuana there are freeways and other roads, and buses, but no passenger rail.\nLocal public transportation in Tijuana is run by semiprivate companies, and has one of the most complex, or perhaps unorganized networks.\n\n\n==== Air ====\nThe Tijuana International Airport (General Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez IA) is the city's main airport, one of the busiest in Mexico, and serves eleven airlines with destinations across Mexico and Shanghai, China. Tijuana Airport is also a second main airport for the San Diego area for passengers heading south into Mexico and Latin America, who may use the airport's Cross Border Xpress terminal located on the U.S. side of the border in Otay Mesa and connected to the rest of the airport on the Mexican side by a pedestrian toll bridge. U.S. and Canadian destinations can be reached via the San Diego International Airport, located about 35 kilometers (22 mi) north of the international border.\n\n\n==== Road ====\nTwo important Mexican federal highway corridors start in Tijuana, one of them is Fed 1, which runs south through the Baja California Peninsula through Rosarito Beach, Baja Mar, and Ensenada before ending in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. From Tijuana to Ensenada, most travelers take Fed 1D (scenic road), a four-lane, limited access toll road that runs by the coast starting at Playas de Tijuana. Fed 2 runs east for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) near the international border, as far as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua.\nWithin the metropolitan area the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 freeway connecte Mesa de Otay in the northeast of the city with Rosarito Beach in the southwest.\nJust north of the San Ysidro border crossing, Interstate 5 and Interstate 805 head northbound to San Diego and beyond. From the Otay Mesa border crossing, Interstate 905 takes drivers west to connect with both I-805 and I-5.\n\n\n==== Intercity buses ====\nThe city's main bus station is in its eastern borough. A small terminal downtown serves a few Mexican bus lines, and U.S.-based Greyhound Lines and Crucero USA. Another bus station near the border provides frequent service to Ensenada, and other major cities\u2014including Mazatl\u00e1n, Culiac\u00e1n, Hermosillo, and Guadalajara. Major bus lines operating in Tijuana include Azul y Blanco de Magallanes (Blue & White) and Transporte Efectivo Express de Tijuana \u2013 TEEXTI; modernizing system originally intended to phase out the other lines that partially introduced but ceased and merged with Azul y Blanco.\n\n\n==== Local buses ====\nIn 2006, Tijuana underwent a major overhaul of its existing system of guayines, or shared fixed-route station wagons, forcing the replacement of the guayines with new models of vans, serving as fixed-route taxis. Major transit hubs include Centro (Downtown Tijuana), Otay, Soler, and the Cinco y Diez avenues. Taxi lines operating in the city include Free Taxis, those that do not maintain a specific route; Economic Taxis; Diamond Taxis \u2013 black or yellow cabs; and regular taxis maintaining a set route. There are as many bus lines and routes as fixed-route taxi ones or calafias, and new routes for buses, taxis or calafias are frequently created, due to high demand of public transportation. Public transportation service is inexpensive, with bus tickets at maximum, USD $0.75. Fixed-route taxis are somewhat more expensive, depending on the taxi route, reaching USD $2.00. Bus, taxi and calafia lines and routes are distinguished from one another by their vehicles colors.\n\n\n==== Bus rapid transit ====\n\nA bus rapid transit system SITT operates one route from Downtown Tijuana and Garita Puerto Mexico near the San Ysidro Port of Entry, southeasterly along the Tijuana River to Terminal Insurgentes in the southeast of the city. It is part of a planned system of main and feeder lines to replace other buses and minibuses.\n\n\n==== Light rail ====\nPreviously there have been plans for a light rail service, for example in January 2009, the City Council and the Ministry of Communications and Transportation announced such a system along the Tijuana River, however so far nothing has come of these plans.There is, however, a light rail connection to downtown San Diego and beyond, starting immediately north of the San Ysidro Port of Entry to the U.S. at the San Ysidro Transit Center, where municipal buses also operate.\n\n\n==== Ride share ====\nRide share services Uber and DiDi operate throughout Tijuana and surrounding cities.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nTijuana has multiple sister cities and twin towns. These relations have been formalized by a variety of organizations as well as municipal governments. Currently twinned with the City of Tijuana are:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n Mexico portal\nTijuana Cartel\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nKun, Josh, and Fiamma Montezemolo, eds.

        "wiki": "Border Art is a contemporary art practice rooted in the socio-political experience(s), such as of those on the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, or frontera. Since its conception in the mid-80's, this artistic practice has assisted in the development of questions surrounding homeland, borders, surveillance, identity, race, ethnicity, and national origin(s).\n\nBorder art as a conceptual artistic practice, however, opens up the possibility for artists to explore similar concerns of identity and national origin(s) but whose location is not specific to the Mexico- United States border.  A border can be a division, dividing groups of people and families. Borders can include but are not limited to language, culture, social and economic class, religion, and national identity.  In addition to a division, a border can also conceive a borderland area that can create a cohesive community separate from the mainstream cultures and identities portrayed in the communities away from the borders, such as the Tijuana-San Francisco border between Mexico and the United States.\nBorder art can be defined as an art that is created in reference to any number of physical or imagined boundaries. This art can but is not limited to social, political, physical, emotional and/or nationalist issues. Border art is not confined to one particular medium. Border art/artists often address the forced politicization of human bodies and physical land and the arbitrary, yet incredibly harmful, separations that are created by these borders and boundaries. These artists are often \"border crossers\" themselves. They may cross borders of traditional art-making (through performance, video, or a combination of mediums). They may at once be artists and activists, existing in multiple social roles at once. Many border artists defy easy classifications in their artistic practice and work.\n\n\n== History of border art specific to the Mexico-United States border ==\nIla Nicole Sheren states, \"Border Art didn't become a category until the Border Art Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo (BAW/TAF). Starting in 1984, and continuing in several iterations through the early twenty-first century, the binational collective transformed San Diego-Tijuana into a highly charged site for conceptual performance art ...The BAW/TAF artists were to link performance, site-specificity, and the U.S.-Mexico Border, as well as the first to export \"border art\" to other geographic locations and situations.\" A proponent of Border Art is Guillermo G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a, founder of The Border Arts Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo.  The Border Arts Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo pioneered tackling the political tensions of the borderlands, at a time when the region was gaining increased attention from the media due to the NAFTA debates.  The contradiction of the border opening to the free flow of capital but simultaneously closing to the flow of immigrants provided the opportunity to address other long-existing conflicts within the region.Antonio Prieto argues that \"As opposed to folk artists, the new generation belongs to the middle class, has formal training and self-consciously conceives itself as a producer of 'border art.' Moreover, their art is politically charged, and assumes a confrontational stance vis-\u00e0-vis both Mexican and U.S. government policies.\"\n\nIn their introduction to the exhibition, La Frontera/The Border: Art About the Mexico/United States Border Experience, Patricio Ch\u00e1vez and Madeleine Grynstejn state, \u201cFor the artists represented here, the border is not a physical boundary line separating two sovereign nations, but rather a place of its own, defined by a confluence of cultures that is not geographically bounded either to the north or to the south. The border is the specific nexus of an authentic zone of hybridized cultural experience, reflecting the migration and cross-pollination of ideas and images between different cultures that arise from real and constant human, cultural, and sociopolitical movements. In this decade, borders and international boundaries have become paramount in our national consciousness and in international events. As borders define the economy, political ideology, and national identity of countries throughout the world, so we should examine our own borderlands for an understanding of ourselves and each other.\u201d\nPrieto notes that \u201cWhile the first examples of Chicano art in the late sixties took up issues of land, community and oppression, it was not until later that graphic artists like Rupert Garc\u00eda began to explicitly depict the border in their work. Garc\u00eda's 1973 silkscreen \"\u00a1Cesen Deportaci\u00f3n!,\" for example, calls for an end to the exploitative treatment of migrant workers who are allowed to cross the border and are then deported at the whim of U.S. economic and political interests.\u201dPrieto notes that for Mexican and Chicano artists, the aesthetics of rascuache created a hybrid of Mexican and American visual culture. While it does not have an exact English translation, the term, rascuache, can be likened to the artistic term, kitsch. It translates most closely from Spanish as \"leftover\" with a sensibility closest to the English term, kitsch.Photographer David Taylor focused on the U.S.-Mexico border by following monuments that mark the official borders of the United States and M\u00e9xico outlined as a result of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. He quotes on his website, \u201cMy travels along the border have been done both alone and in the company of agents. In total, the resulting pictures are intended to offer a view into locations and situations that we generally do not access and portray a highly complex physical, social and political topography during a period of dramatic change.\u201d In his project, Taylor has covered physical borders by documenting the environment and landscape along the border but also addresses social issues by engaging with locals, patrolman, smugglers, and many other people living in and being affected by the U.S.-M\u00e9xico border. He also chooses to address political issues by focusing on the large issue of drug trafficking.\n\n\n== Related artworks ==\nBorder Tuner is a project by the Mexican-Canadian Artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer that explores connections which exist between cities and people on either side of the Mexico - United States border. Situated in the El Paso / Juarez borderlands, this interactive work utilizes large searchlights as a means for participants on either side of the border to communicate with one another. When one beam of light interacts with another, a microphone and speaker automatically switch on allowing participants on both sides to communicate across the hardened infrastructure which divides their two countries.  The searchlight, most commonly used in applications of surveillance and apprehension of migrants by the United States Border Patrol is one of the symbols which Lozano-Hemmer subverts in his work. Of this loaded symbol he says: \u201cI find searchlights absolutely abhorrent, that\u2019s why I must work with them.\u201dBorrando La Frontera (Erasing the Border) by Ana Teresa Fernandez challenges the materiality of the U.S./Mexico border through its erasure of the structure. In the film, Ana Teresa Fernandez hopes to \u201c[turn] a wall that divides into the ocean and the sky that expands\u201d into a symbol for potential future mobility. By making the border the same color as the sky, rendering it invisible, the artist draws attention to the naturalized sense of nation in opposition to the natural landscape. The artist creates new meaning for the sky's natural blue color, as she uses it to symbolize a geography with open borders and freedom of movement. By painting this idea over the border fence, Fernandez and her collaborators The film also emphasizes the natural elements of the scene The birds' and the water's movement, unfazed by the fence, attest to the redundancy of the fence and the politics of the U.S./Mexico border.\nArtesania & Cuidado (Craft & Care) by Tanya Agui\u00f1iga serves as a collection of the artists work in activism, design, and documentation. Specifically, Agui\u00f1iga's entry way to the gallery sets the tone for the exhibition. Agui\u00f1iga is also responsible for AMBOS\u2014Art Made Between Opposite Sides. The project consisting of artworks made that foster a sense of interconnectedness in border regions. The project is multifaceted and presents itself in the form of documentary, activism, community engagement, and collaboration to activate the U.S./ Mexico border, exploring identities affected by the luminal zone of the border and to promote healthy relationships from one side of the border to the other.\"World Trade Center Walk\" by (Philippe Petit)  Called the \"artistic crime of the century,\" Petit's daring feat became the focus of a media sensation. On the morning of August 7, Petit stepped onto the tightrope, which was suspended between the two towers. A crowd of thousands soon gathered to watch the man on the wire more than 1,300 feet above them. For 45 minutes, Petit practically danced on the thin metal line. He was arrested for his efforts and was ordered to give a performance in Central Park as his sentence.Another artist tackling the contentions of the United States/Mexico border is Judi Werthein, who in 2005 created a line of shoes titled, Brinco, Spanish for the word Jump. These shoes would be distributed, free of charge, to people in Tijuana looking to cross the border. Werthein explains, \"The shoe includes a compass, a flashlight because people cross at night, and inside is included also some Tylenol painkillers because many people get injured during crossing.\" Additionally, the shoes featured removable soles with a map of the San Diego/Tijuana border, specifically indicating favorable routes to take. On the back of the ankle of the shoe is an image of Toribio Romo Gonz\u00e1lez, the saint dedicated to Mexican migrants. The shoes themselves were made cheaply and mass-produced from China, imitating the means of production abused by many American companies. These shoes would also be sold in small boutique shops in San Diego for $215 a pair, advertised to the higher class audience as \"one-of-a-kind art objects.\" The profits of this venture would then be donated to a Tijuana shelter aiding migrants in need.Jorge Rojas\u2019s performance art is complex in its approach of reflecting his cross-cultural experiences in both Mexico and America. Rojas was born in Morelos, Mexico, and now lives in Salt Lake City, Utah. This change in residence has informed the changes in his work regarding his feelings of home vs. homeland. His work examines this change in homeland in ways that highlight his foreignness and his awareness of both cultures. His performance pieces often combine Mexican cultural themes with a performance style that creates a new space to identify the constant change in cultural identity.Shinji Ohmaki's piece \u201cLiminal Air Space-Time\u201d talks about the physical sense of liminal space, and how this represents a boarder. this liminal space is represented by a thin white piece oh clothe that blows in the air. The use of vents underneath constantly keeps it floating in the air. Ohmaki says, \"The cloth moves up and down, causing a fluctuation of the borders that divide various territories\u2026 some people they will feel that time is passing quickly While others might feel that time is being slowed down. By tilting the sensations, a dimension of time and space that differs from everyday life can be created.\" So just like and actual boarder you get a sense of not knowing whee you are and how long you will be stuck float in the air.\n\n\n== History of border art specific to Palestine-Israel ==\n\nIn June 2005, performance artist Francis Al\u00ffs walked from one end of Jerusalem to the other performing The Green Line. In this performance, Al\u00ffs is carrying a can filled with green paint. The bottom of the can was perforated with a small hole, so the paint dripped out as a continuous squiggly line on the ground as he walked. The route he followed was one drawn in green on a map as part of the armistice after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, indicating land under the control of the new state of Israel. Al\u00ffs restricted his walking to a 15-mile stretch through a divided Jerusalem, a hike that took him down streets, through yards and parks, and over rocky abandoned terrain. Julien Deveaux documented the walk alongside Al\u00ffs.\n\nArtist invested in Palestine/Israel art:\nSama Alshaibi: A well known artist that uses her body as an instrument for her artwork. Focuses the context of double generational displacement as well as the notion of being \"illegal\" in the United States as described as psychological displacement. Her body serves as an \"allegorical sight\" and \"captures feminine perspective.\" She focuses on portraying the life of a displaced Palestinian woman who immigrated to the United States at an early age with her family. She also describes information based on embroidery with Palestinian and Arab women. Some of her artworks are: Milk Maid, Carry Over, Together Apart, and Between Two Rivers.\n\n\n=== International artists and their influence ===\nThere have been several artists from other countries who have come to the Israeli West Bank barrier and used the wall itself as a canvas to express their condemnation of its establishment. They have worked in hand with local Palestinian street artists as well to express their sentiments and ultimately get across their message. These much more well known international artists have also aided in turning the public eye to the conflict that is occurring between Palestine and Israel. Many of the artists that work on the separation barrier have taken something that is perceived as an instrument of division and thus turned it into the canvas in which they create their message.\n\n\n==== Banksy ====\n\nThe anonymous, UK-based artist, Banksy, is a prominent figure in the way individuals have used the separation wall as surface to express their dissent for its establishment. He has used the dimension of the wall, the division it represents, and the context behind it to make works that succeed in their environment. One of his more popular works depicts a dove, a symbol of peace, juxtaposed with it wearing a bullet-proof vest. Here, it can be inferred that Banksy is trying to express that there is a want for peace between the two nations, yet given the history of violence, they must be prepared for conflict. Essentially, he is demonstrating the fake sense of peace that is being generated as a byproduct of this wall. \n\nOther works Banksy has done over the years also including creating optical illusions to break up the solidarity of the wall. He tries to emphasize the elements of a barrier, how it divides up space and creates a disconnect from the world around the viewer. He has works such as children in front of a \"hole\" in front of the wall that reveals a paradise, a world unseen by the viewer due to the obstruction by the wall.Banksy has expressed his different opinions on the Israeli-Palestine conflict and the experiences he has encountered while working on border art. An often cited conversation between Banksy and a Palestinian man helps illustrate the sentiments towards the wall from the Palestinian perspective:\n\"Old man: You paint the wall, you make it look beautiful.\nMe [Banksy]: Thanks.\nOld man: We don't want it to be beautiful, we hate this wall. Go home.\" The gravity of this conversation demonstrates how border art can have a political message or help a group of people express their opinion, yet it the art cannot take away the wall. In this interaction, the wall is the antagonist to the Palestinian people and any attempt to beautify the wall is rendered useless because it does not remove the rift that is produced.\nBanksy has made other comments regarding the size and scale of the separation barrier in regards to how it essentially isolates the Palestinian population, nearly surrounding them on every side. He says, \"It essentially turns Palestine into the world's largest open-air prison.\"\n\n\n==== Swoon (artist) ====\n\nAnother artist is American born street artist, swoon, who has worked on the separation barrier as one of the few prominent female artists that have influenced the male dominated world of street art. Swoon is instrumental to creating a female narrative  in this increasingly studied area of art. Many of her pieces depict women as the key figures and protagonists of their respective compositions and ultimately gives another perspective to the border art phenomenon.\nHer border art on the separation barrier focuses on the characteristics of scale and location, causing the viewer to comprehend the sheer size of the wall in relation to the body. Swoon explains why scale is important to her by saying, \" '...I think it's important that people understand the scale of it because it helps in understanding the grotesque power imbalance that the Palestinian people are facing.' \" By creating this contrast in size of the viewer to her art work, it causes the individual to question the wall, bring attention to it, and consider the lengths Israel has taken to protect itself from external forces.\nOne of her works that demonstrates this concept is that of her Lace-Weaving Woman, here the subject rises about halfway up the wall and looks as if she weaving her skirt. The action of weaving here implies a sense of unity, and in its context is juxtaposed as the wall is symbolized as division. Other pieces by Swoon have been focusing on location such as creating art where a Palestinian youth had placed a Palestinian flag at the top of the barrier and then was subsequently arrested by Israeli officials. Swoon has not given definitive meanings behind her work, and allow the viewers to interpret these spaces where she has worked and how her art has changed it, if at all.\n\n\n== Conceptual border(s) ==\nBorders can also be conceptual. For example, borders between social classes or races. Gloria Anzald\u00faa's conceptualization of borders goes beyond national borders.  Anzald\u00faa  states: \"The U.S.-Mexican border es una herida abierta where the Third World grates against the first and bleeds. And before a scab form, it hemorrhages again, the lifeblood of two worlds merging to form a third country - a border culture.\" Anzald\u00faa also refers to the border as being a locus of rupture and resistance; fragmented.Borderlands. Border artists include Ana Mendieta, Guillermo G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a, Coco Fusco, and Mona Hatoum.\nConceptually speaking, borders, as discussed by Claire Fox, can be found anywhere; it is portable. Especially wherever poor, ethnic, immigrant, and/or minority communities collide with hegemonic society.Prieto notes that \u201cThis double task --being critical while at the same time proposing a utopian borderless future-- was undertaken with the tools of conceptual art.\u201d Conceptual art was a European avant-garde artistic practice which focused on the intellectual development of an artwork rather than art as object.\n\nBorder is further discussed in Adalbarto Aguirre Jr. and Jennifer K. Simmers academic journal and discusses the fluidity of borders saying that\u201cThe border merges land and people into a shared body of social and cultural representation.\u201d The article also continues on saying that the meaning of border changes with the people that experience them.Sheren additionally echoes that \u201c\u2018Border\u2019 began to refer to a variety of non-physical boundaries: those between cultural or belief systems, those separating the colonial and the postcolonial, and even those demarcating various kinds of subjects.\u201d In this way, borders transcend physicality and become \u2018portable\u2019.\nIn a conceptual mindset, the human body can be viewed as a borderline. This is explored in Gloria Anzaldua's article La Frontera = The Border: Art about the Mexico/United States Border Experience. She discusses at length the Layers of our identities and how we become these boundaries within our environment. She mentions the dynamics that affect our identities such as sex, gender, education, ethnicity, race, class, etc. The author questions if these are equal parts or are pieces of our self more prevalent due to our surroundings? She speaks about the concept of unified consciousness, a mix of identity from the universal collective in human existence. She continues by saying we must articulate a person not categorized by one thing but as a history of identities such as student, mother, sister, brother, teacher, craftsman, coworker, etc.Another individual who also explores ideas of the human body acting as a conceptual border is Sama Alshaibi. This is expressed in her personal essay and art titled Memory Work in the Palestinian Diaspora. In contextualizing her art work that is mentioned later in the piece, she discusses her and her family's personal history. \"My body, pictured in my American passport, had the ability to travel and move freely in this world and could come back to the U.S. and speak for those whom I met in Occupied Palestine, confined to a single city and cut off from the world by massive walls.\" After referencing her own personal and familial narratives, Sama then shifts her discussion toward utilizing her body again within her art; her body acts as \"a vehicle to embody and illustrate visual narratives of the Palestinian past and present.\" Overall, her photographs and videos depicting her body at the center of focus are all in an attempt to construct a \"collective memory,\" \"...[a memory] which culminates in a different mediation of history, one that resists the \"official\" and mediated history Palestine and Israel.Stuart Hall also elaborates on the concept of identity in his article: Ethnicity, Identity, and Difference. He replaces the idea of an intersectional identity model with a layered identity model. The layered model lists titles of identity within one person in order of which is more prevalent depending on the circumstances. The intersectional is outdated due to the idea of having one central identity and branching off of it is a multitude of descriptions such as race, class, and gender.\nTrinh T. Minh-ha additionally observes \u201cboundaries not only express the desire to free/to subject one practice, one culture, one national community from/to another, but also expose the extent to which cultures are products of the continuing struggle between official and unofficial narratives\u2013those largely circulated in favor of the State and its policies of inclusion, incorporation, and validation, as well as of exclusion, appropriation, and dispossession.\u201dPatssi Valdez touches on the idea of the border in her screenprint, \"L.A./TJ.\" Valdez is an American Chicana artist currently living and working in Los Angeles. Unlike most who hear the word border and immediately assume separation, her idea of a border is a frame. Seen in L.A./TJ, Valdez frames the two cities, thus exaggerating the idea of mixing reality rather than separating the two. This mixing of reality is a symbol of her belonging and interacting with both Mexico and the United States.\n\n\n== Expanding notions of \u201cBorder Art\u201d ==\nThere exist inherent difficulties in articulating the traumas of the Holocaust. The art created between direct and post-generational participants redefines notions of \u201cmemory-as-border.\u201d In other words, understanding the notions of \u201cborder\u201d becomes complex in relation to firsthand and secondhand trauma. One example of this thought is how the experiences of those directly involved in the Holocaust effect their offspring? Marianne Hirsch describes this phenomenon as \u201cpostmemory.\u201dPostmemory most specifically describes the relationship of children of survivors of cultural or collective trauma to the experiences of their parents, experiences that they \u201cremember\u201d only as the narratives and images with which they grew up, but that are so powerful, so monumental, as to constitute memories in their own right. The term \u201cpostmemory\u201d is meant to convey its temporal and qualitative difference from survivor memory, its secondary, or second-generation memory quality, its basis in displacement, its vicariousness and belatedness. The work of postmemory defines the familial inheritance and transmission of cultural trauma. The children of victims, survivors, witnesses, or perpetrators have different experiences of postmemory, even though they share the familial ties that facilitate intergenerational identification.Artist Sama Alshaibi, considers Hirsch's conception of postmemory as \"key to my life and to my art practice, which is, after all, an extension of who I am.\" Born to a Palestinian mother and an Iraqi father, Alshaibi describes her upbringing as \"...dominated by traumatic narratives of losing Palestine, and all along I was mourning for a place unknown to me.\" As a result, her work is \"based on narratives of my mother's family's forced migration from Palestine to Iraq and then on to America.\"In Headdress of the Disinherited, Alshaibi photographic work features the artist wearing her recreation of a traditional Palestinian headdress lined with coins that were used as a bride's wedding dowry. Alshaibi describes the headdress as part of an inter-generational transmission: \"Fashioned after my mother's faint memory of her grandmother's, our collaborative effort constructs a memorial to our family's continual migrations.\" Alshaibi recreated the headdress using familial ephemera and travel documentation rather than coins, \"Substituting the no longer minted Palestinian currency with coins embossed with our visas, passport stamps, and pictures suggests an intellectual dowry rather than a monetary one.\"  Dowry money hat resembles migration and displacement. The placement continues to hold an effect over heads today, with the dematerialization of women's bodies and cultures from the region.\n\n\n== Border art in practice and examples of work ==\nDoris Salcedo, Shibboleth, 2007, Installation Art, Tate Modern\nSama Alshaibi\nAhlam Shibli\nFrancis Al\u00ffs\nYishay Garbasz\nMona Hatoum\nSusan Meiselas\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude, Running Fence, 1972-76, Sonoma and Marin Counties, California\nAna Mendieta, Silueta Series, 1973-1980\nAnila Quayyum Agha\n\n\n== References ==\nHall, S.

        "wiki": "Tijuana (US:  tee-(H)WAH-n\u0259, Spanish: [ti\u02c8xwana] (listen)) is the largest city of both Baja California State and the Baja California Peninsula. It is part of the San Diego\u2013Tijuana transborder urban agglomeration and the larger Southern California megalopolis. As the 6th-largest city in Mexico and center of the 6th-largest metro area in Mexico, Tijuana exerts a strong influence in education and politics \u2013 across Mexico, in transportation, culture and art \u2013  across all three Californias (the U.S. state of California, Baja California and Baja California Sur), and in manufacturing and as a migration hub \u2013 across the North American continent. Currently one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in Mexico, Tijuana maintains GaWC 'sufficiency city' status. As of 2015, the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,641,570.Tijuana is located on the Pacific coast of Baja California, and is the municipal seat and the cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality (Mexican states are divided into municipalities, rather than counties as in the U.S.). Tijuana covers 70% of the territory of the municipality and contains 80% of its population. A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent, the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies. In the early 21st century,  Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America. Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca. The city is the most visited border city in the world; sharing a border of about 24 km (15 mi) with its sister city San Diego. More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year. This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the fourth busiest land-border crossing in the world. It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone.Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico.  According to the 2015 census, the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico, with a population of 1,840,710, but rankings vary, the city (locality) itself was 6th largest and the municipality (administrative) 3rd largest nationally.  The international metropolitan region was estimated at about 5,158,459 in 2016, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region, 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas, and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico.  Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego.\nTijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias. As the American occupation of the Mexican capital ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Tijuana's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure. The city was founded on July 11, 1889 as urban development began. Often known by its supposed initials, T.J., and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico, the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe city's name comes from the rancho that Santiago Arg\u00fcello Moraga established in 1829 on his Mexican land grant, naming it Rancho T\u00eda Juana.The first Spanish mission call the settlement variously as La T\u00eda Juana, Tiguana, Tiuana, Tiwana, Tijuan, Ticuan, as well as Tijuana. While the Mexican city standardized to Tijuana, the American term for both the river and a U.S. settlement which is now part of San Ysidro remained T\u00eda Juana until the mid-20th century.\nThe commonly accepted theory among historians is that T\u00eda Juana, as Arg\u00fcello named his rancho, is derived from the word Tiwan (\"by the sea\") in the language of the Kumeyaay\u2014the original aboriginal inhabitants of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Urban legend, however, states that T\u00eda Juana, which means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, was a real person whose inn provided food and lodging to travelers. There is however no record of such an inn; in fact the first building in the area was built by Arg\u00fcello in any case, after naming his ranch Rancho T\u00eda Juana.\n\n\n=== Nicknames ===\nIn Southern California, Tijuana is often referred to as TJ or T.J. Baja Californians have adopted this pronunciation as Tiyei. In Spanish the demonym for someone from Tijuana is Tijuanense, while in English the demonym is Tijuanan. A very common slang term used for a person from Tijuana is Tijuanero.The nickname Tijuas is increasingly popular among residents and visitors alike. Due to a recent increase in violence in the city, a new term is developing. The phrase Yo Tijuaneo, \u00bfy t\u00fa? translates to I Tijuanate, and you?. This term comes from a new popular local verb Tijuanear meaning to Tijuana, describing the cosmopolitan aspects of living in the city and frequently crossing the border.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe land was originally inhabited by the Kumeyaay, a tribe of Yuman-speaking hunter-gatherers. Europeans arrived in 1542, when the explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo toured the coastline of the area, which Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno mapped in 1602. In 1769, Juan Cresp\u00ed documented more details about the area that was later called the Valley of Tijuana. Jun\u00edpero Serra founded the first mission of Alta California in nearby San Diego.\nFurther settlement took place near the end of the mission era when Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda, governor of the Baja California and Alta California, awarded a large land grant to Santiago Arg\u00fcello in 1829. This large cattle ranch, Rancho T\u00eda Juana, covered 100 km2 (40 sq mi). Although \"Tia Juana\" means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, the name was actually an adaptation of the word 'Tihuan' or 'Tiju\u00e1n' in the Kumeyaay language, the name of a nearby Kumeyaay settlement and whose meaning is disputed.In 1848, as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War with the United States, Mexico lost all of Alta California. The majority of the 1,000 Hispanic families living in Alta California stayed there, though some moved south to remain inside Mexico. Because of this Tijuana gained a different purpose on the international border. The area had been populated by ranchers, but Tijuana developed a new social economic structure. These were farming and livestock grazing, plus as a transit area for prospectors.\n\n\n=== 1889\u20131915: Town established ===\nUrban settlement began in 1889, when descendants of Santiago Arg\u00fcello and August\u00edn Olvera entered an agreement to begin developing the city of Tijuana. The date of the agreement, July 11, 1889, is recognized as the founding of the city. Tijuana saw its future in tourism from the beginning. From the late 19th century to the first few decades of the 20th century, the city attracted large numbers of Californians coming for trade and entertainment. The California land boom of the 1880s led to the first big wave of tourists, who were called \"excursionists\" and came looking for echoes of the famous novel \"Ramona\" by Helen Hunt Jackson.\nIn 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, revolutionaries claiming loyalty to Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n took over the city for shortly over a month. Federal troops then arrived. Assisted by the \"defensores de Tijuana\", they routed the revolutionaries, who fled north and were promptly arrested by the United States Army.\nThe Panama-California Exposition of 1915 brought many visitors to the nearby California city of San Diego. Tijuana attracted these tourists with a Feria T\u00edpica Mexicana \u2013 Typical Mexican Fair. This included curio shops, regional food, thermal baths, horse racing and boxing.\n\n\n=== 1916\u20131935: Gambling and drinking destination ===\nThe first professional race track opened in January 1916, just south of the border gate. It was almost immediately destroyed by the great \"Hatfield rainmaker\" flood of 1916. Rebuilt in the general area, it ran horse races until the new Agua Caliente track opened in 1929, several miles south and across the river on higher ground.\nLegal drinking and gambling attracted U.S nationals in the 1920s during Prohibition. The Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area became the city's tourist center, with casinos and the Hotel Caesar's, birthplace of the Caesar salad.\nIn 1925, the city by presidential decree changed his name to   ciudad Zaragoza, but its name reverted to Tijuana in 1929.\nIn 1928, the Agua Caliente Touristic Complex was opened, including hotel, spa, dog-track, private airport, golf course and gambling casino. A year later, the new Agua Caliente Racetrack joined the complex. During the eight years it operated, the Agua Caliente hotel, casino and spa achieved a near mythical status, with Hollywood stars and gangsters flying in and playing. Rita Hayworth was discovered there. Musical nightclub productions were broadcast over the radio. A singer known as \"la Faraona\" got shot in a love-triangle and gave birth to the myth of a beautiful lady ghost. Remnants of the Agua Caliente casino can be seen in the outdoor swimming pool and the \"minarete\" (actually a former incinerator chimney) nearby the southern end of Avenida Sanchez Taboada, on the grounds of what is now the Lazaro Cardenas educational complex.\n\n\n=== 1935\u20131965: Tourism broadens ===\nIn 1935, President C\u00e1rdenas decreed an end to gambling and casinos in Baja California, and the Agua Caliente complex faltered, then closed. In 1939, it was reopened as a junior high school (now, Preparatoria L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas). The buildings themselves were torn down in the 1970s and replaced by modern scholastic architecture.\nWith increased tourism and a large number of Mexican citizens relocating to Tijuana, the city's population grew from 21,971 to 65,364 between 1940 and 1950.\n\nWith the decline of nightlife and tourism in the 1950s, the city restructured its tourist industry, by promoting a more family-oriented scene. Tijuana developed a greater variety of attractions and activities to offer its visitors.\n\n\n=== 1965\u20132001: The city matures ===\nIn 1965 the Mexican federal government launched the Border Industrialization Program to attract foreign investment. Tijuana and other border cities became attractive for foreign companies to open maquiladoras (factories), and the Tijuana economy started to diversify. Manufacturing jobs attracted workers from other parts of Mexico and the city's population grew from less than half a million in 1980 to almost 1 million in 1985.\nIn 1972, work began on the first concrete channeling of the Tijuana River; previously the river would flood across a wide plain east and southeast of downtown, inundating an area of wood, cardboard and metal shacks called Cartolandia (\u201cPaperland\u201d).  The project removed the shacks and added 1.8 million sq. m. of usable land, on which the Zona R\u00edo was built. With the 1981 opening of the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana mall and the 1982 Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT), Zona R\u00edo became the new commercial center of a modern Tijuana, and with its new boulevards with monument-filled glorietas (roundabouts), reminiscent of the grand Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, the city created the new image and allure of a modern, large city, rather than just a border town focused on tourism and vice.In 1994, PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana while making an appearance in the plaza of Lomas Taurinas, a neighborhood nestled in a valley near Centro. The shooter was caught and imprisoned, but doubts remain about who the mastermind might have been.\n\n\n=== 2001\u20132011: Violence and decline of US tourism ===\nAfter 9/11, tighter US border controls resulted in hours-long waits to return to the US. The number of US visitors dropped sharply due to this factor, as well as subsequent drug violence.Around 2008, thousands of Tijuana's elite bought houses in and moved to Bonita and Eastlake in Chula Vista, California to escape violence, kidnapping and other crimes taking place during that period. An article in The Los Angeles Times reported that the emigration to San Diego County has transformed the demographic and cultural character of some cities to a degree.\n\n\n=== 2011\u2013present: Tijuana strengthens ===\nIn recent years, Tijuana has become an important city of commerce and migration for Mexico and US. In spite of the violence and border crossing issues, the city has received a large number of tourists from US, China, Japan and the south of Mexico. Thanks to the realization of cultural and business festivals, the city has improved its image before the world, standing out as a competitive city for investment. Currently, the commercial and business sector is committed to the boom in the gastronomic industry, craft beer, entertainment and real estate, as well as medical tourism, to attract visitors and investors.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTijuana is the westernmost city in Mexico, and consequently in Latin America, and the second largest city of northern Mexico. Located about 210 kilometers (130 mi) west of the state capital, Mexicali, the city is bordered to the north by the cities of Imperial Beach, and the San Diego neighborhoods of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, California. To the southwest of the city is Rosarito Beach, while to the south is unincorporated territory of Tijuana Municipality. The city is nestled among hills, canyons, and gullies. The central part of the city lies in a valley through which flows the channeled Tijuana River.\nHousing development in the Tijuana Hills has led to eradication of many seasonal mountain streams. This lack of natural drainage makes places within the city vulnerable to landslides during the rainy season. The varied terrain of Tijuana gives the city elevation extremes that range from sea level to 790 meters (2,590 ft).\nTijuana is noted for its rough terrain, which includes many canyons, steep hills, and mesas. Among noted canyons in Tijuana are Canyon K and Canyon Johnson. Large Tijuana hills include Red Hill (Cerro Colorado) and Hill of the Bees (Cerro de las Abejas) in the eastern part of the city.\nThe city is located near the terminus of the Tijuana River and within the Tijuana River Basin. The Tijuana River is an intermittent river, 195 km (121 mi) long, on the Pacific coast of northern Baja California in Mexico and Southern California in the United States. It drains an arid area along the California\u2013Baja California border, flowing through Mexico for most of its course and then crossing the border for the last 8 km (5 mi) of its course where it forms an estuary that empties into the ocean. The river's lower reaches harbor the last undeveloped coastal wetlands in San Diego County, and some of the last in Southern California, amidst a highly urbanized environment at the southern city limits of Imperial Beach.\nAs downtown Tijuana was built at the bottom of the river valley, the district is subject to seasonal flooding created by drain-off from the Tijuana Hills. During this time, east-bound portions of the Via Rapida (east-west highway) may be blocked off by the Tijuana Police due to hazardous conditions.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city's skyscraper history is relatively recent. Some of the first highrise building complexes constructed in the city were the twin towers of Grand Hotel Tijuana. Tijuana experienced a building boom that was brought to a halt by the Great Recession. Among buildings that succumbed to the time period was the Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico that would have been located in Playas and reached 98 m (322 ft). Currently the tallest building, and soon to be the largest complex in footage, New City Residential reaches 102 m (335 ft). Overall, the city maintains 33 completed structures with other proposed and under-construction skyscrapers.\n\nThe Tijuana skyline is the fifth largest skyline in Mexico and is located in the Zona Rio and to a smaller extent, Playas de Tijuana. In the Zona Rio the buildings are concentrated on the Tijuana River, lined parallel to the river; and on the edges of the Tijuana Country Club. In Playas the high rises are currently focused on the coast. Recent construction on high rises has begun in the aforementioned areas, as buildings such as New City Residential and Grand Hotel Tijuana have been developed and taken prominent places in the skyline as the tallest buildings. From Tijuana's skyline the San Diego skyline can also be seen, although the reverse is mostly not true on account of the high hills surrounding central Tijuana.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Tijuana is divided into eight administrative boroughs, or Delegaciones. The Tijuana metropolitan area occupies all of borough seats. The boroughs are in turn divided into colonias or ejidos. These boroughs offer administrative services such as urban planning, civil registry, inspection, verification, public works and community development and are served by a delegado.\n\nCentro \u2014 \"Delegaci\u00f3n Centro\" includes the old downtown (Zona Centro), new business district (Zona R\u00edo), red light district (Zona Norte), and other adjacent neighborhoods (\"zonas\"). This is the historical midpoint of Tijuana; the municipal palace is located here as well as most of the tourist zones, such as Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n and the business district. The Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT for CEntro CUltural de Tijuana) is located here as well as the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana, until recently the largest mall in the state, within the Zona Rio.\nCerro Colorado \u2014 The Cerro Colorado (\"Red Hill\") is located here and it is surrounded by houses. Because of its height many of the area's antennae for radio and television stations are located on its peak.\nLa Mesa \u2014 This is where the Morelos Park, the largest public park in the city, is located, as well as the retail and transit hub Cinco y Diez, Plaza Mundo Divertido, the new Macroplaza and the CETYS University.\nOtay Centenario \u2014 This borough was created in 2014 by merging Mesa de Otay and Centenario boroughs. In this borough sits the Tijuana International Airport.  The Tijuana campus of the Autonomous University of Baja California and the Technologico are also located here as well as many maquiladoras. This is the borough with the largest number of factories and maquiladoras. Its largest colony is Ciudad Industrial (\"Industrial City\"). Three of the city's most important streets, Boulevard Bellas Artes, Boulevard Industrial and Fed 2, are located here.  This delegacion contains the Otay Mesa entry to the United States and the Friendship Park (Parque de la amistad).\nPlayas de Tijuana \u2014 This is the westernmost borough of the city bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the United States border on the north. This is where the beaches of Tijuana are located (hence the name) and it is also one of the two exits to the south towards Rosarito and Ensenada.\nLa Presa \u2014 literally \"'the dam'\", this is the largest borough in size and the Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez Dam is located within its limits, hence its name. The new Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 and the Tijuana-Tecate freeways run through it.\nSan Antonio de los Buenos \u2014 This is mostly a residential area although it also has two industrial parks.\nSanchez Taboada \u2014 Like the previous borough this is mostly a residential area, but within its borders are located many \"maquiladoras\" specially at Pacific Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTijuana's climate is a semi-arid (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh), with about 231 mm (9.09 in) of annual precipitation, and generally mild to warm weather year-round. It has characteristics of the Mediterranean climate (Csa) found to the immediate north, with most of the annual precipitation falling in the winter, between the months of November and March.\n\nBetween November and March, storms originate from fronts entering off of the Pacific Ocean. January is the wettest month of the year for the city and during this time a periodic event, similar to June Gloom, is observed created by marine layer. January is the coolest month, during which temperatures average 13.6 \u00b0C (56.5 \u00b0F). In the city April signifies the end of winter and the start of Santa Ana winds. Though the daytime highs are generally around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), heat waves can reach up to 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F). The hottest months in the city are August and September, during which temperatures average 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Summers are by far the driest time of year since influences from the California Current and the North Pacific High suppress the formation of rainfall caused by the North American Monsoon. As in coastal Southern California, air pollution sometimes occurs during periods of temperature inversion, especially during summer and fall, but (unlike Mexico City) is seldom severe and in recent years has lessened due to cleaner car engines.Frost and snow are rare phenomena in the city as temperatures are usually well above freezing. Yet, in December 1967, snow fell in the city and in January 2007 feather light snow fell in the east of the city. However, excessive amounts of snow fall have never been recorded in the city. On February 14, 2008 a winter storm caused an unusual snowfall in the upper reaches of the hills of the city.\nThe record low temperature recorded in the city was \u22126 \u00b0C (21 \u00b0F), while the highest was 49 \u00b0C (120 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nTijuana has a diverse cosmopolitan population which includes migrants from other parts of Mexico and from all over the world. Tijuana has one of Mexico's largest Asian populations, predominantly consisting of Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese immigrants. Tijuana also has a large and rapidly growing population of United States citizens, mostly from Southern California.  Many Latin Americans, notably Cubans, and Guatemalans, have made Tijuana their home. The city also has many Lebanese, Italian, French, Spanish citizens. Recently, the city has received a large influx of Haitian immigrants.\n\nThe majority of Tijuana's migrant Mexican population hail from Sinaloa, Michoac\u00e1n, Jalisco, Oaxaca, and the Federal District. Because of the diversity of Mexico and the influx of immigrants from almost every region in the country, there are no accurate estimates on ethnicity or race of the current population. The heavy influx of immigrants to the city and municipality of Tijuana has led to job creation in the form of over 700 twin-plant (maquiladora) factories, which serve as the basis of employment for the majority of the working-class people in northern Mexico.  The high poverty level in Tijuana is attributed to the city's \"magnet status\" for people who have come from the poorer south of the nation and citizens from other nations seeking to escape from extreme poverty.  Tijuana holds a status that provides the possibility of employment as well as higher education and the dream of crossing the border.  Tijuana and Baja California in general have much stronger economies and higher incomes than other Mexican cities along the United States border, as well as more moderate weather.\nTijuana today is one of the fastest growing cities in Mexico with an average of 80,000 people moving to Tijuana yearly.  In terms of area, the city grows by approximately three hectares a day, mostly east and south as the city is mostly built out to the beach already with the exception of some canyons.  Along with settlements separated from Tijuana proper and other communities unimproved land, big business moves in providing supermarkets and retail to marginal areas, along with paved roads.  The city experiences the construction of 26,000 new settlers a year that has led to the unregulated, illegal squatter homes that takes place in the hills and valleys of ever expanding Tijuana, most of these areas are still without city services like sidewalks, paving, streetlights, and public transit. This is an ongoing process: as older and existing squatter areas are brought into the city services, more marginal areas become occupied by squatters.\nSquatter areas are home to displaced and uprooted people, among them the indigenous and poverty stricken, as well as migrants deported from the USA, many of whom are also without Mexican citizenship.  In recent years, working-class suburban housing estates have sprung up in the fringes to provide a sense of safety and land ownership.  These suburbs enable young families to isolate their families from the violence of the drug war and squatter areas.  These outlying communities tend to be much better equipped than their squatter counterparts.  Nevertheless, some remote areas are drug plantations for narcotics, and delinquency has spread to areas once considered safe havens.  These issues occasionally come to light in the newspapers.\nNational Population Council (CONAPO) data has estimated that by 2030, growth rates maintaining, the city will become the second largest in Mexico and anchor to the fourth largest metropolitan area in Mexico. The suburban sprawl observed in Tijuana leaves the downtown and beach areas relatively affluent.\n\nWhile the INEGI Census 2010 placed Tijuana's population at 1.3 million, only two percent more than in 2005 Census, Tijuana City Council estimates from 2010 place the population closer to two million, at 1.6 million. As funding for cities is based on the populace of the city, the Council worries about receiving adequate funds to provide for the needs of the city.  The population discrepancies may be explained by a few factors.  Shanty towns that have not been rasterized and an undercount, people having left Tijuana for United States, and people leaving Tijuana for the interior of Mexico due to the intensification of the drug war, and suburbanization outside city limits but still inside the municipality.  Tijuana, because of the dreams of border crossers, and its relatively higher wages compared to the rest of Mexico, naturally attracts immigrants.  Since an improvement in security since 2011, the population of Tijuana as reflected in the 2015 Mexican census is expected to return to its normal growth curve; the great reduction in violence should make the settlement of Tijuana an attractive option again versus fringe valleys, nevertheless exact figures from the census await.\nAccording to the Second Census of Population and Housing of the year 2010 conducted by the INEGI (National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics) the municipality of Tijuana has 1,559,683 inhabitants within 879 km2, the city or settlement of Tijuana only covers \u2154 of that area.  While the metropolitan area of Tijuana (1392 km2), composed of Tijuana Municipality and Rosarito Beach Municipality, has 1,751,302 inhabitants. Tecate Municipality, adjacent to Tijuana Municipality, has not yet been considered by the government as part of the metropolitan area.  However, there is great economic and cultural exchange between the cities regions though there are still expanses of rural land. As Tijuana grows, many of its suburbs have been built increasingly inland, and in the direction of Tecate; Valley of the Palms is a large planned city between the two.\nAs of 2005 the large majority of the city's population, 96%, adhere to the beliefs of Christianity. The denominations are further divided into followers of Catholicism \u2013 61% \u2013 and of Protestantism \u2013 35%.  While other beliefs occupying a 4% margin in the city include Taoism (among other Asian and European religions), atheism and agnosticism is also found.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nTijuana is the birthplace and base of the Tijuana Cartel.  From 2007 through 2010, Tijuana experienced an unusually high level of violent crime related to gang violence, in part derived from the Mexican drug war and human trafficking.  Homicides peaked in 2010, when 844 people were killed, compared with 355 in 2004 and 349 in the first eight months of 2011. Reportedly, the wave of violence resulted from a turf war as the administration of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n weakened the local Arellano F\u00e9lix cartel; violence slowed when the larger Sinaloa cartel took control.During peak years of violent crime in the city, gun battles between rival cartels, and between cartels and the police, erupted in public. In April 2008, police found 1,500 shell casings on various streets after one battle left 13 suspected drug traffickers dead. In 2009 and depending on the source, Tijuana Municipality experienced either 556 or 1,118 murders, mostly as a result of the drug war.There were 492 murders in 2013, a 48% increase in the homicide rate between 2012 and 2013. This was the highest number of murders since 2010. By the end of 2017, the number of murders in Tijuana increased to 1,744, which was almost double those in 2016.As of 2018, Tijuana had the highest per capita rate for homicides in the world at 138 murders per 100,000 people.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Region ===\n\nAt present the parties with greater presence in Tijuana are the National Action Party (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). The PAN has been the dominant party in the city for 20 years. Historically the PRI had been the dominant party in regional politics, until 1989 when the PAN began to dominate the city, until yet again, in 2004, PRI began regaining prominence and won the Mayor's Office.\nLess prominent parties also maintain relations with the dominant parties. These other parties, with less presence include the New Alliance Party (PANAL), Social Encounter Party (PES), and Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Allied with the PAN at the state and local level under the Alliance for Baja California are the Social Encounter Party (PES) and New Alliance Party (PANAL). Allied with the PRI at the state and local level under the \"Alliance for Better Living\" are the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) and Baja California State Party (PEBC).\n\n\n=== International ===\nTijuana's importance and rise to a global city has led to its recognition among countries worldwide. In addition to international cultural recognition, Tijuana has received political recognition and is a developing a political center currently host to eight consulates from European, Asian, and North American countries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\n\nTijuana is a large manufacturing center, and in addition to tourism, it serves as a cornerstone of the city economy. In the past decade alone, Tijuana became the medical device manufacture capital of the North American continent, surpassing previous leader Minneapolis - Saint Paul.The city's proximity to Southern California and its large, skilled, diverse, and relatively inexpensive workforce make it an attractive city for foreign companies looking to establish extensive industrial parks composed of assembly plants that are called maquiladoras, even more so than other cities in the US-Mexican border zone, taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to export products. At its peak, in 2001 Tijuana had roughly 820 of these 'maquiladoras'. Foreign and domestic companies employ thousands of employees in these plants, usually in assembly-related labor. Such jobs are not demanding but typically offer above average salaries for Mexico, with most maqiladoras jobs beginning at Mex$100 per day (about 5 US dollars, as of September 2016), significantly above the Mexican minimum wage of Mex$57.46 (about 3 US dollars, as of September 2016). Companies that have set up maquiladoras in Tijuana include Lanix, Hyundai, Sony, Vortec, BMW, Vizio, Toyota, Dell, Samsung, Kodak, Matsushita/Panasonic, GE, Nabisco, Ford, Microsoft, Cemex, Zonda, Philips, Pioneer, Airbus, Plantronics, Siemens Mexico, Jaguar, Pall Medical, Tara, Sanyo and Volkswagen. Many of the maquiladoras are located in the Otay Mesa and Florido sections of Tijuana.\nEconomic development has its central business district at Zona R\u00edo, which together, with the corridor along Blvd. Agua Caliente (the extension of Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n), contains the majority of the higher-end office space in the city.\n\n\n=== Tourist economy and entertainment ===\nTijuana also relies on tourism for a major part of its revenue. About 300,000 visitors cross by foot or car from the San Ysidro point of entry in the United States every day. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs, and shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are part of the draw for the city's tourists, many located within walking distance of the border. The city's tourist centers include Downtown Tijuana including the nightlife hot spots around La Sexta, Avenida Revolucion, souvenir shopping at the Mercado de Artesan\u00edas and Plaza Viva Tijuana, Tijuana's Cultural Center (CECUT) and neighboring Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana shopping center, and the city's best known vices, in the form of its legal Red Light District and gambling (Agua Caliente). Mexico's drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college aged Southern Californians who tend to stay on Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n.\nTijuana is also known for its red-light district Zona Norte (also referred to as La Coahuila after one of its main streets) with legal prostitution in strip clubs and on the street. The strip clubs are typically full-contact, meaning the dancers let patrons fondle them. Many dancers also sell their sexual services. In a 1999 estimation, there were 15,000 women engaged in prostitution in Tijuana outside of clubs and brothels.Tijuana has many pharmacies that target visitors from the United States, which sell some medicines without prescriptions and/or at much lower costs than in the U.S. Many medications still require a Mexican prescription, which can be obtained from adjacent doctors' offices. People filling up prescriptions for drugs classified in the US as Schedule II or Schedule III have found it more difficult to locate such medications, and the purchase of pseudoephedrine also has become restricted by Tijuana pharmacies, just as in the U.S. To fill a prescription in Tijuana for any drug covered by the US Controlled Substances Act  and legally bring it into the United States requires a prescription from the United States for re-import.  Americans can import up to a 90-day supply of non-controlled medications for personal use to the USA from Mexico and other countries.\nBusinesses such as auto detailing, medical and dental services and plastic surgery are heavily marketed, and are usually much less expensive than in the U.S.\nTijuana is headquarters for Mexico's largest gambling concern, Grupo Caliente, which operates the only casinos in the city, more than twenty branches.Tourists are sometimes robbed by municipal police.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nPlaza Rio Tijuana is a large regional mall anchored by Cin\u00e9polis, Sanborns, S\u00faper DAX and Sears.\nAll across the city, there are dozens of plazas comerciales, which may be strip malls or small enclosed or open-air centers, with a combination of any or all of the following anchors:\n\none of the 26 Tijuana branches of the small department store Coppel,\na supermarket or hypermarket,\na cin\u00e9polis or cinemex multicinema,\na branch of the electronics and motorcycle retailer ElektraAn important concentration of plazas is in the Cinco y Diez around an eponymous intersection, named for a former American-style five and dime store that was located there. It is also a major hub for public transit. Plaza Carrousel, with its namesake merry-go-round, is located here.\nCostco, Sam's Club, and Walmart each have multiple branches across the city.\nTraditional markets with vendors include the large Mercado Hidalgo in Zona R\u00edo, smaller neighborhood markets and the Mercado Municipal downtown.\nTijuana was the headquarters of 14-store Dorian's department store chain until its demise in 2009; most were converted to Sears stores.\n\n\n=== Culinary ===\nTijuana, along with the nearby Valle de Guadalupe, has recently become a culinary hotspot due to its Baja Med cuisine, including chefs such as Javier Plascencia, but also for its tacos, other street food, food trucks, coffee houses and artisanal beer.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTijuana is home to many private Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and High Schools as well as nationally high ranked colleges and universities. Notable primary and secondary schools include Metropolitan, Instituto M\u00e9xico, Instituto Cumbres, President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas School, Agua Caliente School Center High, Polit\u00e9cnico de Baja California(CLUB DE QU\u00cdMICA), Jos\u00e9 Fimbres Moreno School and the State High School, and Ignacio Ram\u00edrez School located in Cerro Colorado. These schools maintain recognition for their demands and high standards.\nTijuana maintains multiple higher education institutions. These include the Autonomous University of Baja California, Tijuana (UABC), Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Tijuana (ITT), Universidad Iberoamericana (UIA-Tijuana), CETYS Universidad, Universidad Xochicalco, and University of the Californias. Other colleges include Tijuana University Center, Tijuana University of Technology, Graduate Center of the Northwest, and the University of Professional Development. The city is the seat of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), an institution of scientific research and higher education, specializing in the study of the problems in the border region between Mexico and the United States. In August 2009, Metropolitan UABC opened in Valle de Las Palmas, in the Tijuana metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Culture and contemporary life ==\nMany foreigners travel to Tijuana to drink and dance, buy prescription drugs, purchase bootleg brand-name clothing, timepieces, and other personal accessories found globally, as well as manufactured and hand-crafted local curiosities. Locals and regular tourists avoid hassles by visiting the clubs at Plaza Fiesta or other areas of the Zona R\u00edo without the crowds, heavy marketing, and occasional tourist misbehavior or outright lawbreaking common on the Revoluci\u00f3n strip. However, Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n has been known for its proliferation of nightclub shows, primarily catering to casual tourists. While still an entertaining town with an enjoyable atmosphere, some locals and tourists feel it has lost an \"anything goes\" atmosphere, that was dangerous to locals, tourists, and the tourism industry.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nAs Tijuana matured from a tourist-oriented border town into one of Mexico's largest cities, the 1982 opening of the Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT) marked a milestone. CECUT's mission was to strengthening Tijuana's image, both to US visitors and to Mexicans, as a destination for culture and not only shopping and vice. The center includes an OMNIMAX cinema showing IMAX films, the Museum of the Californias, contemporary art exhibition halls, a restaurant, caf\u00e9, bookstore,  and other cultural facilities.\nLa Casa de la Cultura cultural center comprises a school, a theater, and a public library, and teaches dance, painting, music, plastic arts, photography and languages.\nOther cultural venues include the Instituto Municipal de Arte y Cultura (Municipal Institute of Art and Culture), the Tijuana Wax Museum, the Museo El Trompo (Trompo Museum), and El Foro, the former Jai Alai Palace, that is now a concert venue. Concerts are also held at the Estadio Caliente stadium, Hip\u00f3dromo Agua Caliente Racetrack, and at the \"Audiorama\" at the Museo El Trompo children's museum of science and technology.The Tijuana Country Club (Club Campestre de Tijuana) has many affluent members and a famous golf course and also functions as an entertainment and events venue. Tijuana also has a large Rotary Club.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\nParque Morelos has a small zoo and park space; Parque de la Amistad in Otay Centenario has a small pond, and a running and dirt-bike track. Parque Teniente Guerrero is a downtown park with a public library and weekend entertainment by clowns.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nTijuana's nightlife scene is one of the city's strongest attractions. The area surrounding \"La Sexta\", the intersection at Calle Sexta and Av. Revoluci\u00f3n, is now a major hub of new bars and dance clubs. Zona Rio, Tijuana's new Downtown, is home to some of the city's finest restaurants and bars. Another capstone of Tijuana's entertainment offerings is its adult nightlife industry, which includes the city's red light district as well as less conspicuous adult entertainment venues.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nTijuana also has a very active and independent artist community whose internationally recognized work has earned Tijuana the title of \"one of the most important new cultural meccas\", according to Newsweek, an exhibition of Tijuana's current art scene, is being curated by the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and is traveling across the USA in 2006 and 2007. Art collectives like Bulbo and film production like Palenque Filmaciones explore the use of film like the award-winning Tijuana Makes Me Happy, media like television bulbo TV and print \"bulbo PRESS\", to show different realities of Tijuana out of Mexico. In 2004, Tijuana earned international acclaim for an art exhibition displayed on the cement banks of the Tijuana River and along the Mexico/U.S. border fence in Otay Mesa.\nGraffiti is widespread in Tijuana. They can range from free-hand writing in spray can and marker form, often carrying social or sexual commentary in English or Spanish, pictures in wheatpaste and stencils, consisting of stenciled renderings of personalities crucial to Hispanic culture from past and present eras, such as television news announcers or stars, but also extending to images of artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed. Graffiti in Tijuana may seem at first to consist largely of simplistic tags and thus not as technically evolved, colorful, or accepted in the mainstream as the \"pieces\" of graffiti scenes of the United States, Europe, or Japan, but large, colorful graffiti murals adorn walls from both native Tijuanan artists as well as visiting graffiti writers, especially from California. The Tijuanan art pieces show as much prowess and skill as those made by their more renowned U.S. counterparts, although illicit graffiti are strongly discouraged by the Tijuana government, as in other major metropolitan areas.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nSince the decade of the 1920s, Tijuana has excelled in the musical field, thanks to the first groups of ranchera music that began to set the tourist establishments in the area with the visit of foreigners, including the former Casino Agua Caliente.\nRock music was very popular and popular among young people in the mid-50s, leaving the ranch rhythm aside years ago. Another event that added the arrival of Rock to Tijuana was the visit of the African-American pianist and guitarist, Gene Ross, who came to play at the Convoy Club on Revolution Avenue. The presence of this artist was the beginning of the rock scene in the region that marked a new style in the country.54 Some groupings of the nascent Mexican rock began, an example of which was \"The Tijuana Five\", who made some covers in Spanish of Anglo-Saxon successes.\nJavier Batiz founded in 1957 he founded a group called \"Los TJ's\" with which he collected musical influences that were received in the Mexican border cities of black music, blues and R&B from people like T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin 'Wolf, James Brown, among others. Later he would start his solo career in the rest of the country and participating in some bands in Mexico City.\nDuring the 60s, the American trumpeter Herb Alpert, in a visit to the bullfights made in the old Bullfight, found musical inspiration so after the recording of his single \"The Lonely Bull\", which was a radio hit in 1962. With the success, he decided to make a casting and formed \"The Tijuana Brass\", with whom he toured and had a presentation on television. It was a musical collaboration with artists from Los Angeles, with style called \"Tijuana Marimba\u00b4s Brass\". The band was dissolved in 1969 but they continued with some presentations under the name of T.J.B. 55\nAt the end of the 60s and during the 70s, rock and roll still had great acceptance in the public. In those years bands such as \"The Moonlights\" had national and international recognition, who achieved successes such as \"Tijuana Funky\" or \"Are you\"; the \"Rockin Devils\", recognized for their Spanish cover of \"Bule Bule\", which achieved international success. The Roble Cinema, La Caba\u00f1a club and Flamingos club, would be some of the main stages of the decade for musical performances in the city.56\nIn the 70s, rock groups and musicians experienced government rejection and censorship for the lyrics of the songs. Romantic music took a boom and from there came bands like \"The Battle of Tijuana\", \"Los Solitarios\", \"Los Terr\u00edcolas\", \"Old Memories\", \"Tito Pantoja and his friends\", \"Ritmo 7\", \"Los Old Friends \",\" California Brass \"and \"Los Corazones Solitarios\", among others.\nIn the late 80s, Antonio De Carlo, was recognized as a revelation artist at the OTI Festival, having a successful career during the 90s, with songs such as \"In A Thousand Pieces\", \"A Pecho Discovery\", \"Revolution\" and \"Like It Hurts \". Lynda also gained national relevance in pop, achieving hits in songs like \"Lost Heart\", \"Tell\", \"A Thousand for an Hour\", among others.\nDespite the downturn in rock artists for some years, in the 90s Tijuana No! emerged, returning a bit of the genre to the city. They also incorporated ska, punk and reggae. \"No\" would be the first album released, from which successes like \"Pobre de ti\", which had Julieta Venegas as a vocalist, would emerge. Later the singer began her solo career already in the 00s of the 21st century. Her musical career reached the recording of six studio albums, and she won two Grammys, six Latin Grammys, six MTV Latin America and two Latin Music Billboard.\nThe city continued to be a hotbed of important rock bands, among them, especially at the international level, Specimen, other bands and prominent artists could be Ohtli, Nona Delichas, Canseco, Sonoro 2 and Headlongs. Electronic music boomed in the 90s, Murcof and the Nortec Collective, entered the scene and began to gain worldwide recognition for merging electronic music with northern and band music. This group was enriched with the visual contribution of designers and videographers who, under the same concept, provided images to this musical proposal.\nRegarding Mexican regional music, some groups of the northern genre were emerging, highlighting Los Tucanes de Tijuana, who since the 80s began their musical career until popularizing songs such as \"La Chona\", \"El Tucanazo\", \"La Chica Sexy\", among others. The Agua Caliente Band, Explosi\u00f3n Norte\u00f1a, among others, would be a new generation of Mexican popular music artists.\nAmong other things, Tijuana has been the inspiration for the birthplace of Nortec music style and Ruidoson, resulting in a very large and active electronic music scene where groups and artists like Los Macuanos, Maria y Jose, Siberium, Hidhawk and Harpocrates emerged. Tijuana also enjoys a large base of support in many other musical scenes such as mexican hip hop, reggae, hardcore, punk, black metal and house music. Famous musicians are from Tijuana including the pop-rock singer-songwriter Lynda Thomas and Vanessa Zamora and international indie punk bands like Delux and Los Kung-Fu Monkeys.\nTo promote the cultural development in children and youth of Tijuana, since 1996 the Tijuana Youth Symphony (SJT) has been promoted, which promotes education and musical training through instrument practices, music reading and public concerts. In addition, Tijuana has an opera season. There are also several musical festivals throughout the year, among which the Latin American Guitar Festival, Mainly Mozart Binacional, and the International Exhibition of contemporary dance \"Bodies in Transit\" stand out.\nTijuana is home to the Baja California Orchestra, one of the most prestigious and solid artistic institutions in northwestern Mexico, which was nominated for the Latin Grammy in the category of best classical album by the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Inc ., with the album Tango kills Danz\u00f3n kills Tango. This phonogram was distinguished as 'Best Classical Album of the year 2001' by the Mexican Union of Theater and Music Chroniclers. Currently, it maintains an annual season, offering symphonic and chamber music concerts in the most important forums of Tijuana and Baja California.\nAlready in the new century, many local bands have emerged, from all musical genres, some of them staying with local and national recognition. Highlights Nosis, High Slogan, Go Future, Ramona, The Children of the Saint, Among Deserts, Ziruela, Palos Verdes, Edwin, among others. Each of them have contributed and tried to revive the musical talent for which Tijuana has always been characterized.\nMusical clubs along the Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area and others often cater to a diverse range of tastes by offering nightly variations on musical fare, such as new wave music one night, and punk rock bands on the next. Some European metal bands whose members cannot perform in the United States due to prior felony convictions in their own countries play music festivals in Tijuana for fans from both Mexico and the United States.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city is home to the Tijuana Zonkeys professional basketball team of the CIBACOPA basketball league. The team is composed mostly of players from Mexico and plays from February to July in the Municipal Auditorium.\nThe city has a strong tradition of association football, Club Tijuana began playing in the Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n on the 2011/12 season, winning the 2012 Apertura title. They play their matches at the Estadio Caliente, a new 33,000 seat stadium. The team's mascot is the Xoloitzcuintle, a famous Mexican hairless dog.\nTijuana also has a long history of producing many world champion professional boxers, such as Antonio Margarito and Erik Morales.\n\n\n=== Stadiums ===\nEstadio Caliente\n\nThe stadium is the Estadio Caliente, match venue for Club Tijuana, a Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n football team. It is located in the Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Baja California (Mexico). Caliente Homes Stadium, is a multi-purpose center in Tijuana. It is mainly used for football matches, has a seating capacity of 21,000 spectators.  Opened in June 2008, according to the work schedule. It was a significant reason for Tijuana Club was promoted to the M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n; FEMEXFUT requires participating teams should have a stadium with a seating capacity of over 15,000. It is at this stage the U-17 FIBA Americas Championship 2009 was held bound for Nigeria. Was introduced in M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n during the Apertura 2011 tournament of the Mexican Football Federation.Estadio Chevron\n\nThe Chevron Stadium  is the home of the Toros de Tijuana. It opened in 1977 and housed the Colts missing Tijuana Mexican Pacific League. Subsequently, the stadium was used for football matches. For 2004, professional baseball returned, now with a franchise LMB under the name of Toros de Tijuana, which, the following year, changed its name to Colts as it had been known previously. At first the facility was called Cerro Colorado Stadium, due to its location at the foot of the hill of that name. With the return of baseball, chain supermarkets Calimax bought the naming rights to the stadium.  In 2004, the first season of Toros, the fans filled the stadium for most matches.  On April 4, 2013, the stadium was remodeled, marking the beginning of a new era for Toros de Tijuana.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\n\n\n==== Water ====\nThe Tijuana State Commission of Public Services (CESPT) supplies the city with its water, while the city receives its electricity from La Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE).\nIn 2019, due to extremely low water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir, CESPT began a city-wide water rationing scheme. This rationing scheme would divide Tijuana and nearby Rosarito into 5 zones. Each zone would be cut-off from the water supply on a rotating schedule of 4 days with water and 1 day without water. This scheme was expected to last for at least 2 months until the water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir were improved.\n\n\n==== Wastewater ====\nThe International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) developed, as a joint project of the USA and Mexico in the mid-1980s following substantial environmental studies, treats 25 million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Tijuana River; directly pumped across the border from the central collection point in Mexico. When the river is flowing, the diversion system of the plant begins operating and diverts up to about 12-13mgd to the IWTP. The total amount of water being diverted must not exceed 25 mgd, based on a monthly average decided upon by permit conditions, although the IWTP can treat sustained flows up to 45mgd daily and peaks of 70mgd for a short period. The diversion system regularly sends approximately six to eight million gallons of water daily to the IWTP. The plant is currently being upgraded to include a secondary treatment facility.\nThe city also four to five decentralize units that are part of the Tijuana/Rosarito Potable Water and Wastewater Master Plan. This plan was required as part of Public Law 106-457, put into order November 7, 2000, which was written to allow the Bajagua project to move forward. The master plan was a binational collaborative effort by EPA and CESPT and addressed San Diego-Tijuana's needs for the next 20 years. The plants are intended to treat approximately 5mgd each, to tertiary levels and provide the reclaimed water to the surrounding areas for agriculture, industry etc. There are several issues that they are facing: no infrastructure to convey the reclaimed water to customers and inadequate groundwater recharge infrastructure.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications ====\nTijuana's telephonic system operates under area code 664, but it is not the same area code 664 that is part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) because Mexico is not one of the countries represented in the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) where the country code is 1. So, to dial a phone number from San Diego to Tijuana requires an international access code and Mexico's Country Code, 52, before dialing the area code and the number.  It is similar for anyone calling from Tijuana to the United States.\nTelephonic landlines in Tijuana are provided by the company Telnor; other companies include Axtel, Izzi Telecom and Alestra. Popular cell phone carriers in the city-region include Movistar, Telcel, and AT&T Mexico. Many U.S. carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile offer free roaming in Mexico and it is possible to connect to U.S. based cell phone towers in many northern parts of the city. Cell phones also have historic usage in Tijuana as the first cellular call in Mexico was made in Tijuana in 1989.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nTijuana is a major gateway to the interior of Mexico to which it is connected by air and road directly, and by sea via the ports of Ensenada and San Diego. Within Tijuana there are freeways and other roads, and buses, but no passenger rail.\nLocal public transportation in Tijuana is run by semiprivate companies, and has one of the most complex, or perhaps unorganized networks.\n\n\n==== Air ====\nThe Tijuana International Airport (General Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez IA) is the city's main airport, one of the busiest in Mexico, and serves eleven airlines with destinations across Mexico and Shanghai, China. Tijuana Airport is also a second main airport for the San Diego area for passengers heading south into Mexico and Latin America, who may use the airport's Cross Border Xpress terminal located on the U.S. side of the border in Otay Mesa and connected to the rest of the airport on the Mexican side by a pedestrian toll bridge. U.S. and Canadian destinations can be reached via the San Diego International Airport, located about 35 kilometers (22 mi) north of the international border.\n\n\n==== Road ====\nTwo important Mexican federal highway corridors start in Tijuana, one of them is Fed 1, which runs south through the Baja California Peninsula through Rosarito Beach, Baja Mar, and Ensenada before ending in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. From Tijuana to Ensenada, most travelers take Fed 1D (scenic road), a four-lane, limited access toll road that runs by the coast starting at Playas de Tijuana. Fed 2 runs east for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) near the international border, as far as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua.\nWithin the metropolitan area the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 freeway connecte Mesa de Otay in the northeast of the city with Rosarito Beach in the southwest.\nJust north of the San Ysidro border crossing, Interstate 5 and Interstate 805 head northbound to San Diego and beyond. From the Otay Mesa border crossing, Interstate 905 takes drivers west to connect with both I-805 and I-5.\n\n\n==== Intercity buses ====\nThe city's main bus station is in its eastern borough. A small terminal downtown serves a few Mexican bus lines, and U.S.-based Greyhound Lines and Crucero USA. Another bus station near the border provides frequent service to Ensenada, and other major cities\u2014including Mazatl\u00e1n, Culiac\u00e1n, Hermosillo, and Guadalajara. Major bus lines operating in Tijuana include Azul y Blanco de Magallanes (Blue & White) and Transporte Efectivo Express de Tijuana \u2013 TEEXTI; modernizing system originally intended to phase out the other lines that partially introduced but ceased and merged with Azul y Blanco.\n\n\n==== Local buses ====\nIn 2006, Tijuana underwent a major overhaul of its existing system of guayines, or shared fixed-route station wagons, forcing the replacement of the guayines with new models of vans, serving as fixed-route taxis. Major transit hubs include Centro (Downtown Tijuana), Otay, Soler, and the Cinco y Diez avenues. Taxi lines operating in the city include Free Taxis, those that do not maintain a specific route; Economic Taxis; Diamond Taxis \u2013 black or yellow cabs; and regular taxis maintaining a set route. There are as many bus lines and routes as fixed-route taxi ones or calafias, and new routes for buses, taxis or calafias are frequently created, due to high demand of public transportation. Public transportation service is inexpensive, with bus tickets at maximum, USD $0.75. Fixed-route taxis are somewhat more expensive, depending on the taxi route, reaching USD $2.00. Bus, taxi and calafia lines and routes are distinguished from one another by their vehicles colors.\n\n\n==== Bus rapid transit ====\n\nA bus rapid transit system SITT operates one route from Downtown Tijuana and Garita Puerto Mexico near the San Ysidro Port of Entry, southeasterly along the Tijuana River to Terminal Insurgentes in the southeast of the city. It is part of a planned system of main and feeder lines to replace other buses and minibuses.\n\n\n==== Light rail ====\nPreviously there have been plans for a light rail service, for example in January 2009, the City Council and the Ministry of Communications and Transportation announced such a system along the Tijuana River, however so far nothing has come of these plans.There is, however, a light rail connection to downtown San Diego and beyond, starting immediately north of the San Ysidro Port of Entry to the U.S. at the San Ysidro Transit Center, where municipal buses also operate.\n\n\n==== Ride share ====\nRide share services Uber and DiDi operate throughout Tijuana and surrounding cities.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nTijuana has multiple sister cities and twin towns. These relations have been formalized by a variety of organizations as well as municipal governments. Currently twinned with the City of Tijuana are:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n Mexico portal\nTijuana Cartel\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nKun, Josh, and Fiamma Montezemolo, eds.

        "wiki": "Tijuana (US:  tee-(H)WAH-n\u0259, Spanish: [ti\u02c8xwana] (listen)) is the largest city of both Baja California State and the Baja California Peninsula. It is part of the San Diego\u2013Tijuana transborder urban agglomeration and the larger Southern California megalopolis. As the 6th-largest city in Mexico and center of the 6th-largest metro area in Mexico, Tijuana exerts a strong influence in education and politics \u2013 across Mexico, in transportation, culture and art \u2013  across all three Californias (the U.S. state of California, Baja California and Baja California Sur), and in manufacturing and as a migration hub \u2013 across the North American continent. Currently one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in Mexico, Tijuana maintains GaWC 'sufficiency city' status. As of 2015, the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,641,570.Tijuana is located on the Pacific coast of Baja California, and is the municipal seat and the cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality (Mexican states are divided into municipalities, rather than counties as in the U.S.). Tijuana covers 70% of the territory of the municipality and contains 80% of its population. A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent, the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies. In the early 21st century,  Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America. Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca. The city is the most visited border city in the world; sharing a border of about 24 km (15 mi) with its sister city San Diego. More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year. This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the fourth busiest land-border crossing in the world. It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone.Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico.  According to the 2015 census, the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico, with a population of 1,840,710, but rankings vary, the city (locality) itself was 6th largest and the municipality (administrative) 3rd largest nationally.  The international metropolitan region was estimated at about 5,158,459 in 2016, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region, 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas, and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico.  Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego.\nTijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias. As the American occupation of the Mexican capital ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Tijuana's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure. The city was founded on July 11, 1889 as urban development began. Often known by its supposed initials, T.J., and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico, the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe city's name comes from the rancho that Santiago Arg\u00fcello Moraga established in 1829 on his Mexican land grant, naming it Rancho T\u00eda Juana.The first Spanish mission call the settlement variously as La T\u00eda Juana, Tiguana, Tiuana, Tiwana, Tijuan, Ticuan, as well as Tijuana. While the Mexican city standardized to Tijuana, the American term for both the river and a U.S. settlement which is now part of San Ysidro remained T\u00eda Juana until the mid-20th century.\nThe commonly accepted theory among historians is that T\u00eda Juana, as Arg\u00fcello named his rancho, is derived from the word Tiwan (\"by the sea\") in the language of the Kumeyaay\u2014the original aboriginal inhabitants of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Urban legend, however, states that T\u00eda Juana, which means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, was a real person whose inn provided food and lodging to travelers. There is however no record of such an inn; in fact the first building in the area was built by Arg\u00fcello in any case, after naming his ranch Rancho T\u00eda Juana.\n\n\n=== Nicknames ===\nIn Southern California, Tijuana is often referred to as TJ or T.J. Baja Californians have adopted this pronunciation as Tiyei. In Spanish the demonym for someone from Tijuana is Tijuanense, while in English the demonym is Tijuanan. A very common slang term used for a person from Tijuana is Tijuanero.The nickname Tijuas is increasingly popular among residents and visitors alike. Due to a recent increase in violence in the city, a new term is developing. The phrase Yo Tijuaneo, \u00bfy t\u00fa? translates to I Tijuanate, and you?. This term comes from a new popular local verb Tijuanear meaning to Tijuana, describing the cosmopolitan aspects of living in the city and frequently crossing the border.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe land was originally inhabited by the Kumeyaay, a tribe of Yuman-speaking hunter-gatherers. Europeans arrived in 1542, when the explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo toured the coastline of the area, which Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno mapped in 1602. In 1769, Juan Cresp\u00ed documented more details about the area that was later called the Valley of Tijuana. Jun\u00edpero Serra founded the first mission of Alta California in nearby San Diego.\nFurther settlement took place near the end of the mission era when Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda, governor of the Baja California and Alta California, awarded a large land grant to Santiago Arg\u00fcello in 1829. This large cattle ranch, Rancho T\u00eda Juana, covered 100 km2 (40 sq mi). Although \"Tia Juana\" means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, the name was actually an adaptation of the word 'Tihuan' or 'Tiju\u00e1n' in the Kumeyaay language, the name of a nearby Kumeyaay settlement and whose meaning is disputed.In 1848, as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War with the United States, Mexico lost all of Alta California. The majority of the 1,000 Hispanic families living in Alta California stayed there, though some moved south to remain inside Mexico. Because of this Tijuana gained a different purpose on the international border. The area had been populated by ranchers, but Tijuana developed a new social economic structure. These were farming and livestock grazing, plus as a transit area for prospectors.\n\n\n=== 1889\u20131915: Town established ===\nUrban settlement began in 1889, when descendants of Santiago Arg\u00fcello and August\u00edn Olvera entered an agreement to begin developing the city of Tijuana. The date of the agreement, July 11, 1889, is recognized as the founding of the city. Tijuana saw its future in tourism from the beginning. From the late 19th century to the first few decades of the 20th century, the city attracted large numbers of Californians coming for trade and entertainment. The California land boom of the 1880s led to the first big wave of tourists, who were called \"excursionists\" and came looking for echoes of the famous novel \"Ramona\" by Helen Hunt Jackson.\nIn 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, revolutionaries claiming loyalty to Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n took over the city for shortly over a month. Federal troops then arrived. Assisted by the \"defensores de Tijuana\", they routed the revolutionaries, who fled north and were promptly arrested by the United States Army.\nThe Panama-California Exposition of 1915 brought many visitors to the nearby California city of San Diego. Tijuana attracted these tourists with a Feria T\u00edpica Mexicana \u2013 Typical Mexican Fair. This included curio shops, regional food, thermal baths, horse racing and boxing.\n\n\n=== 1916\u20131935: Gambling and drinking destination ===\nThe first professional race track opened in January 1916, just south of the border gate. It was almost immediately destroyed by the great \"Hatfield rainmaker\" flood of 1916. Rebuilt in the general area, it ran horse races until the new Agua Caliente track opened in 1929, several miles south and across the river on higher ground.\nLegal drinking and gambling attracted U.S nationals in the 1920s during Prohibition. The Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area became the city's tourist center, with casinos and the Hotel Caesar's, birthplace of the Caesar salad.\nIn 1925, the city by presidential decree changed his name to   ciudad Zaragoza, but its name reverted to Tijuana in 1929.\nIn 1928, the Agua Caliente Touristic Complex was opened, including hotel, spa, dog-track, private airport, golf course and gambling casino. A year later, the new Agua Caliente Racetrack joined the complex. During the eight years it operated, the Agua Caliente hotel, casino and spa achieved a near mythical status, with Hollywood stars and gangsters flying in and playing. Rita Hayworth was discovered there. Musical nightclub productions were broadcast over the radio. A singer known as \"la Faraona\" got shot in a love-triangle and gave birth to the myth of a beautiful lady ghost. Remnants of the Agua Caliente casino can be seen in the outdoor swimming pool and the \"minarete\" (actually a former incinerator chimney) nearby the southern end of Avenida Sanchez Taboada, on the grounds of what is now the Lazaro Cardenas educational complex.\n\n\n=== 1935\u20131965: Tourism broadens ===\nIn 1935, President C\u00e1rdenas decreed an end to gambling and casinos in Baja California, and the Agua Caliente complex faltered, then closed. In 1939, it was reopened as a junior high school (now, Preparatoria L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas). The buildings themselves were torn down in the 1970s and replaced by modern scholastic architecture.\nWith increased tourism and a large number of Mexican citizens relocating to Tijuana, the city's population grew from 21,971 to 65,364 between 1940 and 1950.\n\nWith the decline of nightlife and tourism in the 1950s, the city restructured its tourist industry, by promoting a more family-oriented scene. Tijuana developed a greater variety of attractions and activities to offer its visitors.\n\n\n=== 1965\u20132001: The city matures ===\nIn 1965 the Mexican federal government launched the Border Industrialization Program to attract foreign investment. Tijuana and other border cities became attractive for foreign companies to open maquiladoras (factories), and the Tijuana economy started to diversify. Manufacturing jobs attracted workers from other parts of Mexico and the city's population grew from less than half a million in 1980 to almost 1 million in 1985.\nIn 1972, work began on the first concrete channeling of the Tijuana River; previously the river would flood across a wide plain east and southeast of downtown, inundating an area of wood, cardboard and metal shacks called Cartolandia (\u201cPaperland\u201d).  The project removed the shacks and added 1.8 million sq. m. of usable land, on which the Zona R\u00edo was built. With the 1981 opening of the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana mall and the 1982 Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT), Zona R\u00edo became the new commercial center of a modern Tijuana, and with its new boulevards with monument-filled glorietas (roundabouts), reminiscent of the grand Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, the city created the new image and allure of a modern, large city, rather than just a border town focused on tourism and vice.In 1994, PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana while making an appearance in the plaza of Lomas Taurinas, a neighborhood nestled in a valley near Centro. The shooter was caught and imprisoned, but doubts remain about who the mastermind might have been.\n\n\n=== 2001\u20132011: Violence and decline of US tourism ===\nAfter 9/11, tighter US border controls resulted in hours-long waits to return to the US. The number of US visitors dropped sharply due to this factor, as well as subsequent drug violence.Around 2008, thousands of Tijuana's elite bought houses in and moved to Bonita and Eastlake in Chula Vista, California to escape violence, kidnapping and other crimes taking place during that period. An article in The Los Angeles Times reported that the emigration to San Diego County has transformed the demographic and cultural character of some cities to a degree.\n\n\n=== 2011\u2013present: Tijuana strengthens ===\nIn recent years, Tijuana has become an important city of commerce and migration for Mexico and US. In spite of the violence and border crossing issues, the city has received a large number of tourists from US, China, Japan and the south of Mexico. Thanks to the realization of cultural and business festivals, the city has improved its image before the world, standing out as a competitive city for investment. Currently, the commercial and business sector is committed to the boom in the gastronomic industry, craft beer, entertainment and real estate, as well as medical tourism, to attract visitors and investors.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTijuana is the westernmost city in Mexico, and consequently in Latin America, and the second largest city of northern Mexico. Located about 210 kilometers (130 mi) west of the state capital, Mexicali, the city is bordered to the north by the cities of Imperial Beach, and the San Diego neighborhoods of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, California. To the southwest of the city is Rosarito Beach, while to the south is unincorporated territory of Tijuana Municipality. The city is nestled among hills, canyons, and gullies. The central part of the city lies in a valley through which flows the channeled Tijuana River.\nHousing development in the Tijuana Hills has led to eradication of many seasonal mountain streams. This lack of natural drainage makes places within the city vulnerable to landslides during the rainy season. The varied terrain of Tijuana gives the city elevation extremes that range from sea level to 790 meters (2,590 ft).\nTijuana is noted for its rough terrain, which includes many canyons, steep hills, and mesas. Among noted canyons in Tijuana are Canyon K and Canyon Johnson. Large Tijuana hills include Red Hill (Cerro Colorado) and Hill of the Bees (Cerro de las Abejas) in the eastern part of the city.\nThe city is located near the terminus of the Tijuana River and within the Tijuana River Basin. The Tijuana River is an intermittent river, 195 km (121 mi) long, on the Pacific coast of northern Baja California in Mexico and Southern California in the United States. It drains an arid area along the California\u2013Baja California border, flowing through Mexico for most of its course and then crossing the border for the last 8 km (5 mi) of its course where it forms an estuary that empties into the ocean. The river's lower reaches harbor the last undeveloped coastal wetlands in San Diego County, and some of the last in Southern California, amidst a highly urbanized environment at the southern city limits of Imperial Beach.\nAs downtown Tijuana was built at the bottom of the river valley, the district is subject to seasonal flooding created by drain-off from the Tijuana Hills. During this time, east-bound portions of the Via Rapida (east-west highway) may be blocked off by the Tijuana Police due to hazardous conditions.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city's skyscraper history is relatively recent. Some of the first highrise building complexes constructed in the city were the twin towers of Grand Hotel Tijuana. Tijuana experienced a building boom that was brought to a halt by the Great Recession. Among buildings that succumbed to the time period was the Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico that would have been located in Playas and reached 98 m (322 ft). Currently the tallest building, and soon to be the largest complex in footage, New City Residential reaches 102 m (335 ft). Overall, the city maintains 33 completed structures with other proposed and under-construction skyscrapers.\n\nThe Tijuana skyline is the fifth largest skyline in Mexico and is located in the Zona Rio and to a smaller extent, Playas de Tijuana. In the Zona Rio the buildings are concentrated on the Tijuana River, lined parallel to the river; and on the edges of the Tijuana Country Club. In Playas the high rises are currently focused on the coast. Recent construction on high rises has begun in the aforementioned areas, as buildings such as New City Residential and Grand Hotel Tijuana have been developed and taken prominent places in the skyline as the tallest buildings. From Tijuana's skyline the San Diego skyline can also be seen, although the reverse is mostly not true on account of the high hills surrounding central Tijuana.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Tijuana is divided into eight administrative boroughs, or Delegaciones. The Tijuana metropolitan area occupies all of borough seats. The boroughs are in turn divided into colonias or ejidos. These boroughs offer administrative services such as urban planning, civil registry, inspection, verification, public works and community development and are served by a delegado.\n\nCentro \u2014 \"Delegaci\u00f3n Centro\" includes the old downtown (Zona Centro), new business district (Zona R\u00edo), red light district (Zona Norte), and other adjacent neighborhoods (\"zonas\"). This is the historical midpoint of Tijuana; the municipal palace is located here as well as most of the tourist zones, such as Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n and the business district. The Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT for CEntro CUltural de Tijuana) is located here as well as the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana, until recently the largest mall in the state, within the Zona Rio.\nCerro Colorado \u2014 The Cerro Colorado (\"Red Hill\") is located here and it is surrounded by houses. Because of its height many of the area's antennae for radio and television stations are located on its peak.\nLa Mesa \u2014 This is where the Morelos Park, the largest public park in the city, is located, as well as the retail and transit hub Cinco y Diez, Plaza Mundo Divertido, the new Macroplaza and the CETYS University.\nOtay Centenario \u2014 This borough was created in 2014 by merging Mesa de Otay and Centenario boroughs. In this borough sits the Tijuana International Airport.  The Tijuana campus of the Autonomous University of Baja California and the Technologico are also located here as well as many maquiladoras. This is the borough with the largest number of factories and maquiladoras. Its largest colony is Ciudad Industrial (\"Industrial City\"). Three of the city's most important streets, Boulevard Bellas Artes, Boulevard Industrial and Fed 2, are located here.  This delegacion contains the Otay Mesa entry to the United States and the Friendship Park (Parque de la amistad).\nPlayas de Tijuana \u2014 This is the westernmost borough of the city bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the United States border on the north. This is where the beaches of Tijuana are located (hence the name) and it is also one of the two exits to the south towards Rosarito and Ensenada.\nLa Presa \u2014 literally \"'the dam'\", this is the largest borough in size and the Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez Dam is located within its limits, hence its name. The new Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 and the Tijuana-Tecate freeways run through it.\nSan Antonio de los Buenos \u2014 This is mostly a residential area although it also has two industrial parks.\nSanchez Taboada \u2014 Like the previous borough this is mostly a residential area, but within its borders are located many \"maquiladoras\" specially at Pacific Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTijuana's climate is a semi-arid (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh), with about 231 mm (9.09 in) of annual precipitation, and generally mild to warm weather year-round. It has characteristics of the Mediterranean climate (Csa) found to the immediate north, with most of the annual precipitation falling in the winter, between the months of November and March.\n\nBetween November and March, storms originate from fronts entering off of the Pacific Ocean. January is the wettest month of the year for the city and during this time a periodic event, similar to June Gloom, is observed created by marine layer. January is the coolest month, during which temperatures average 13.6 \u00b0C (56.5 \u00b0F). In the city April signifies the end of winter and the start of Santa Ana winds. Though the daytime highs are generally around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), heat waves can reach up to 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F). The hottest months in the city are August and September, during which temperatures average 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Summers are by far the driest time of year since influences from the California Current and the North Pacific High suppress the formation of rainfall caused by the North American Monsoon. As in coastal Southern California, air pollution sometimes occurs during periods of temperature inversion, especially during summer and fall, but (unlike Mexico City) is seldom severe and in recent years has lessened due to cleaner car engines.Frost and snow are rare phenomena in the city as temperatures are usually well above freezing. Yet, in December 1967, snow fell in the city and in January 2007 feather light snow fell in the east of the city. However, excessive amounts of snow fall have never been recorded in the city. On February 14, 2008 a winter storm caused an unusual snowfall in the upper reaches of the hills of the city.\nThe record low temperature recorded in the city was \u22126 \u00b0C (21 \u00b0F), while the highest was 49 \u00b0C (120 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nTijuana has a diverse cosmopolitan population which includes migrants from other parts of Mexico and from all over the world. Tijuana has one of Mexico's largest Asian populations, predominantly consisting of Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese immigrants. Tijuana also has a large and rapidly growing population of United States citizens, mostly from Southern California.  Many Latin Americans, notably Cubans, and Guatemalans, have made Tijuana their home. The city also has many Lebanese, Italian, French, Spanish citizens. Recently, the city has received a large influx of Haitian immigrants.\n\nThe majority of Tijuana's migrant Mexican population hail from Sinaloa, Michoac\u00e1n, Jalisco, Oaxaca, and the Federal District. Because of the diversity of Mexico and the influx of immigrants from almost every region in the country, there are no accurate estimates on ethnicity or race of the current population. The heavy influx of immigrants to the city and municipality of Tijuana has led to job creation in the form of over 700 twin-plant (maquiladora) factories, which serve as the basis of employment for the majority of the working-class people in northern Mexico.  The high poverty level in Tijuana is attributed to the city's \"magnet status\" for people who have come from the poorer south of the nation and citizens from other nations seeking to escape from extreme poverty.  Tijuana holds a status that provides the possibility of employment as well as higher education and the dream of crossing the border.  Tijuana and Baja California in general have much stronger economies and higher incomes than other Mexican cities along the United States border, as well as more moderate weather.\nTijuana today is one of the fastest growing cities in Mexico with an average of 80,000 people moving to Tijuana yearly.  In terms of area, the city grows by approximately three hectares a day, mostly east and south as the city is mostly built out to the beach already with the exception of some canyons.  Along with settlements separated from Tijuana proper and other communities unimproved land, big business moves in providing supermarkets and retail to marginal areas, along with paved roads.  The city experiences the construction of 26,000 new settlers a year that has led to the unregulated, illegal squatter homes that takes place in the hills and valleys of ever expanding Tijuana, most of these areas are still without city services like sidewalks, paving, streetlights, and public transit. This is an ongoing process: as older and existing squatter areas are brought into the city services, more marginal areas become occupied by squatters.\nSquatter areas are home to displaced and uprooted people, among them the indigenous and poverty stricken, as well as migrants deported from the USA, many of whom are also without Mexican citizenship.  In recent years, working-class suburban housing estates have sprung up in the fringes to provide a sense of safety and land ownership.  These suburbs enable young families to isolate their families from the violence of the drug war and squatter areas.  These outlying communities tend to be much better equipped than their squatter counterparts.  Nevertheless, some remote areas are drug plantations for narcotics, and delinquency has spread to areas once considered safe havens.  These issues occasionally come to light in the newspapers.\nNational Population Council (CONAPO) data has estimated that by 2030, growth rates maintaining, the city will become the second largest in Mexico and anchor to the fourth largest metropolitan area in Mexico. The suburban sprawl observed in Tijuana leaves the downtown and beach areas relatively affluent.\n\nWhile the INEGI Census 2010 placed Tijuana's population at 1.3 million, only two percent more than in 2005 Census, Tijuana City Council estimates from 2010 place the population closer to two million, at 1.6 million. As funding for cities is based on the populace of the city, the Council worries about receiving adequate funds to provide for the needs of the city.  The population discrepancies may be explained by a few factors.  Shanty towns that have not been rasterized and an undercount, people having left Tijuana for United States, and people leaving Tijuana for the interior of Mexico due to the intensification of the drug war, and suburbanization outside city limits but still inside the municipality.  Tijuana, because of the dreams of border crossers, and its relatively higher wages compared to the rest of Mexico, naturally attracts immigrants.  Since an improvement in security since 2011, the population of Tijuana as reflected in the 2015 Mexican census is expected to return to its normal growth curve; the great reduction in violence should make the settlement of Tijuana an attractive option again versus fringe valleys, nevertheless exact figures from the census await.\nAccording to the Second Census of Population and Housing of the year 2010 conducted by the INEGI (National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics) the municipality of Tijuana has 1,559,683 inhabitants within 879 km2, the city or settlement of Tijuana only covers \u2154 of that area.  While the metropolitan area of Tijuana (1392 km2), composed of Tijuana Municipality and Rosarito Beach Municipality, has 1,751,302 inhabitants. Tecate Municipality, adjacent to Tijuana Municipality, has not yet been considered by the government as part of the metropolitan area.  However, there is great economic and cultural exchange between the cities regions though there are still expanses of rural land. As Tijuana grows, many of its suburbs have been built increasingly inland, and in the direction of Tecate; Valley of the Palms is a large planned city between the two.\nAs of 2005 the large majority of the city's population, 96%, adhere to the beliefs of Christianity. The denominations are further divided into followers of Catholicism \u2013 61% \u2013 and of Protestantism \u2013 35%.  While other beliefs occupying a 4% margin in the city include Taoism (among other Asian and European religions), atheism and agnosticism is also found.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nTijuana is the birthplace and base of the Tijuana Cartel.  From 2007 through 2010, Tijuana experienced an unusually high level of violent crime related to gang violence, in part derived from the Mexican drug war and human trafficking.  Homicides peaked in 2010, when 844 people were killed, compared with 355 in 2004 and 349 in the first eight months of 2011. Reportedly, the wave of violence resulted from a turf war as the administration of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n weakened the local Arellano F\u00e9lix cartel; violence slowed when the larger Sinaloa cartel took control.During peak years of violent crime in the city, gun battles between rival cartels, and between cartels and the police, erupted in public. In April 2008, police found 1,500 shell casings on various streets after one battle left 13 suspected drug traffickers dead. In 2009 and depending on the source, Tijuana Municipality experienced either 556 or 1,118 murders, mostly as a result of the drug war.There were 492 murders in 2013, a 48% increase in the homicide rate between 2012 and 2013. This was the highest number of murders since 2010. By the end of 2017, the number of murders in Tijuana increased to 1,744, which was almost double those in 2016.As of 2018, Tijuana had the highest per capita rate for homicides in the world at 138 murders per 100,000 people.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Region ===\n\nAt present the parties with greater presence in Tijuana are the National Action Party (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). The PAN has been the dominant party in the city for 20 years. Historically the PRI had been the dominant party in regional politics, until 1989 when the PAN began to dominate the city, until yet again, in 2004, PRI began regaining prominence and won the Mayor's Office.\nLess prominent parties also maintain relations with the dominant parties. These other parties, with less presence include the New Alliance Party (PANAL), Social Encounter Party (PES), and Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Allied with the PAN at the state and local level under the Alliance for Baja California are the Social Encounter Party (PES) and New Alliance Party (PANAL). Allied with the PRI at the state and local level under the \"Alliance for Better Living\" are the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) and Baja California State Party (PEBC).\n\n\n=== International ===\nTijuana's importance and rise to a global city has led to its recognition among countries worldwide. In addition to international cultural recognition, Tijuana has received political recognition and is a developing a political center currently host to eight consulates from European, Asian, and North American countries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\n\nTijuana is a large manufacturing center, and in addition to tourism, it serves as a cornerstone of the city economy. In the past decade alone, Tijuana became the medical device manufacture capital of the North American continent, surpassing previous leader Minneapolis - Saint Paul.The city's proximity to Southern California and its large, skilled, diverse, and relatively inexpensive workforce make it an attractive city for foreign companies looking to establish extensive industrial parks composed of assembly plants that are called maquiladoras, even more so than other cities in the US-Mexican border zone, taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to export products. At its peak, in 2001 Tijuana had roughly 820 of these 'maquiladoras'. Foreign and domestic companies employ thousands of employees in these plants, usually in assembly-related labor. Such jobs are not demanding but typically offer above average salaries for Mexico, with most maqiladoras jobs beginning at Mex$100 per day (about 5 US dollars, as of September 2016), significantly above the Mexican minimum wage of Mex$57.46 (about 3 US dollars, as of September 2016). Companies that have set up maquiladoras in Tijuana include Lanix, Hyundai, Sony, Vortec, BMW, Vizio, Toyota, Dell, Samsung, Kodak, Matsushita/Panasonic, GE, Nabisco, Ford, Microsoft, Cemex, Zonda, Philips, Pioneer, Airbus, Plantronics, Siemens Mexico, Jaguar, Pall Medical, Tara, Sanyo and Volkswagen. Many of the maquiladoras are located in the Otay Mesa and Florido sections of Tijuana.\nEconomic development has its central business district at Zona R\u00edo, which together, with the corridor along Blvd. Agua Caliente (the extension of Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n), contains the majority of the higher-end office space in the city.\n\n\n=== Tourist economy and entertainment ===\nTijuana also relies on tourism for a major part of its revenue. About 300,000 visitors cross by foot or car from the San Ysidro point of entry in the United States every day. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs, and shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are part of the draw for the city's tourists, many located within walking distance of the border. The city's tourist centers include Downtown Tijuana including the nightlife hot spots around La Sexta, Avenida Revolucion, souvenir shopping at the Mercado de Artesan\u00edas and Plaza Viva Tijuana, Tijuana's Cultural Center (CECUT) and neighboring Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana shopping center, and the city's best known vices, in the form of its legal Red Light District and gambling (Agua Caliente). Mexico's drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college aged Southern Californians who tend to stay on Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n.\nTijuana is also known for its red-light district Zona Norte (also referred to as La Coahuila after one of its main streets) with legal prostitution in strip clubs and on the street. The strip clubs are typically full-contact, meaning the dancers let patrons fondle them. Many dancers also sell their sexual services. In a 1999 estimation, there were 15,000 women engaged in prostitution in Tijuana outside of clubs and brothels.Tijuana has many pharmacies that target visitors from the United States, which sell some medicines without prescriptions and/or at much lower costs than in the U.S. Many medications still require a Mexican prescription, which can be obtained from adjacent doctors' offices. People filling up prescriptions for drugs classified in the US as Schedule II or Schedule III have found it more difficult to locate such medications, and the purchase of pseudoephedrine also has become restricted by Tijuana pharmacies, just as in the U.S. To fill a prescription in Tijuana for any drug covered by the US Controlled Substances Act  and legally bring it into the United States requires a prescription from the United States for re-import.  Americans can import up to a 90-day supply of non-controlled medications for personal use to the USA from Mexico and other countries.\nBusinesses such as auto detailing, medical and dental services and plastic surgery are heavily marketed, and are usually much less expensive than in the U.S.\nTijuana is headquarters for Mexico's largest gambling concern, Grupo Caliente, which operates the only casinos in the city, more than twenty branches.Tourists are sometimes robbed by municipal police.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nPlaza Rio Tijuana is a large regional mall anchored by Cin\u00e9polis, Sanborns, S\u00faper DAX and Sears.\nAll across the city, there are dozens of plazas comerciales, which may be strip malls or small enclosed or open-air centers, with a combination of any or all of the following anchors:\n\none of the 26 Tijuana branches of the small department store Coppel,\na supermarket or hypermarket,\na cin\u00e9polis or cinemex multicinema,\na branch of the electronics and motorcycle retailer ElektraAn important concentration of plazas is in the Cinco y Diez around an eponymous intersection, named for a former American-style five and dime store that was located there. It is also a major hub for public transit. Plaza Carrousel, with its namesake merry-go-round, is located here.\nCostco, Sam's Club, and Walmart each have multiple branches across the city.\nTraditional markets with vendors include the large Mercado Hidalgo in Zona R\u00edo, smaller neighborhood markets and the Mercado Municipal downtown.\nTijuana was the headquarters of 14-store Dorian's department store chain until its demise in 2009; most were converted to Sears stores.\n\n\n=== Culinary ===\nTijuana, along with the nearby Valle de Guadalupe, has recently become a culinary hotspot due to its Baja Med cuisine, including chefs such as Javier Plascencia, but also for its tacos, other street food, food trucks, coffee houses and artisanal beer.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTijuana is home to many private Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and High Schools as well as nationally high ranked colleges and universities. Notable primary and secondary schools include Metropolitan, Instituto M\u00e9xico, Instituto Cumbres, President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas School, Agua Caliente School Center High, Polit\u00e9cnico de Baja California(CLUB DE QU\u00cdMICA), Jos\u00e9 Fimbres Moreno School and the State High School, and Ignacio Ram\u00edrez School located in Cerro Colorado. These schools maintain recognition for their demands and high standards.\nTijuana maintains multiple higher education institutions. These include the Autonomous University of Baja California, Tijuana (UABC), Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Tijuana (ITT), Universidad Iberoamericana (UIA-Tijuana), CETYS Universidad, Universidad Xochicalco, and University of the Californias. Other colleges include Tijuana University Center, Tijuana University of Technology, Graduate Center of the Northwest, and the University of Professional Development. The city is the seat of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), an institution of scientific research and higher education, specializing in the study of the problems in the border region between Mexico and the United States. In August 2009, Metropolitan UABC opened in Valle de Las Palmas, in the Tijuana metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Culture and contemporary life ==\nMany foreigners travel to Tijuana to drink and dance, buy prescription drugs, purchase bootleg brand-name clothing, timepieces, and other personal accessories found globally, as well as manufactured and hand-crafted local curiosities. Locals and regular tourists avoid hassles by visiting the clubs at Plaza Fiesta or other areas of the Zona R\u00edo without the crowds, heavy marketing, and occasional tourist misbehavior or outright lawbreaking common on the Revoluci\u00f3n strip. However, Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n has been known for its proliferation of nightclub shows, primarily catering to casual tourists. While still an entertaining town with an enjoyable atmosphere, some locals and tourists feel it has lost an \"anything goes\" atmosphere, that was dangerous to locals, tourists, and the tourism industry.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nAs Tijuana matured from a tourist-oriented border town into one of Mexico's largest cities, the 1982 opening of the Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT) marked a milestone. CECUT's mission was to strengthening Tijuana's image, both to US visitors and to Mexicans, as a destination for culture and not only shopping and vice. The center includes an OMNIMAX cinema showing IMAX films, the Museum of the Californias, contemporary art exhibition halls, a restaurant, caf\u00e9, bookstore,  and other cultural facilities.\nLa Casa de la Cultura cultural center comprises a school, a theater, and a public library, and teaches dance, painting, music, plastic arts, photography and languages.\nOther cultural venues include the Instituto Municipal de Arte y Cultura (Municipal Institute of Art and Culture), the Tijuana Wax Museum, the Museo El Trompo (Trompo Museum), and El Foro, the former Jai Alai Palace, that is now a concert venue. Concerts are also held at the Estadio Caliente stadium, Hip\u00f3dromo Agua Caliente Racetrack, and at the \"Audiorama\" at the Museo El Trompo children's museum of science and technology.The Tijuana Country Club (Club Campestre de Tijuana) has many affluent members and a famous golf course and also functions as an entertainment and events venue. Tijuana also has a large Rotary Club.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\nParque Morelos has a small zoo and park space; Parque de la Amistad in Otay Centenario has a small pond, and a running and dirt-bike track. Parque Teniente Guerrero is a downtown park with a public library and weekend entertainment by clowns.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nTijuana's nightlife scene is one of the city's strongest attractions. The area surrounding \"La Sexta\", the intersection at Calle Sexta and Av. Revoluci\u00f3n, is now a major hub of new bars and dance clubs. Zona Rio, Tijuana's new Downtown, is home to some of the city's finest restaurants and bars. Another capstone of Tijuana's entertainment offerings is its adult nightlife industry, which includes the city's red light district as well as less conspicuous adult entertainment venues.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nTijuana also has a very active and independent artist community whose internationally recognized work has earned Tijuana the title of \"one of the most important new cultural meccas\", according to Newsweek, an exhibition of Tijuana's current art scene, is being curated by the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and is traveling across the USA in 2006 and 2007. Art collectives like Bulbo and film production like Palenque Filmaciones explore the use of film like the award-winning Tijuana Makes Me Happy, media like television bulbo TV and print \"bulbo PRESS\", to show different realities of Tijuana out of Mexico. In 2004, Tijuana earned international acclaim for an art exhibition displayed on the cement banks of the Tijuana River and along the Mexico/U.S. border fence in Otay Mesa.\nGraffiti is widespread in Tijuana. They can range from free-hand writing in spray can and marker form, often carrying social or sexual commentary in English or Spanish, pictures in wheatpaste and stencils, consisting of stenciled renderings of personalities crucial to Hispanic culture from past and present eras, such as television news announcers or stars, but also extending to images of artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed. Graffiti in Tijuana may seem at first to consist largely of simplistic tags and thus not as technically evolved, colorful, or accepted in the mainstream as the \"pieces\" of graffiti scenes of the United States, Europe, or Japan, but large, colorful graffiti murals adorn walls from both native Tijuanan artists as well as visiting graffiti writers, especially from California. The Tijuanan art pieces show as much prowess and skill as those made by their more renowned U.S. counterparts, although illicit graffiti are strongly discouraged by the Tijuana government, as in other major metropolitan areas.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nSince the decade of the 1920s, Tijuana has excelled in the musical field, thanks to the first groups of ranchera music that began to set the tourist establishments in the area with the visit of foreigners, including the former Casino Agua Caliente.\nRock music was very popular and popular among young people in the mid-50s, leaving the ranch rhythm aside years ago. Another event that added the arrival of Rock to Tijuana was the visit of the African-American pianist and guitarist, Gene Ross, who came to play at the Convoy Club on Revolution Avenue. The presence of this artist was the beginning of the rock scene in the region that marked a new style in the country.54 Some groupings of the nascent Mexican rock began, an example of which was \"The Tijuana Five\", who made some covers in Spanish of Anglo-Saxon successes.\nJavier Batiz founded in 1957 he founded a group called \"Los TJ's\" with which he collected musical influences that were received in the Mexican border cities of black music, blues and R&B from people like T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin 'Wolf, James Brown, among others. Later he would start his solo career in the rest of the country and participating in some bands in Mexico City.\nDuring the 60s, the American trumpeter Herb Alpert, in a visit to the bullfights made in the old Bullfight, found musical inspiration so after the recording of his single \"The Lonely Bull\", which was a radio hit in 1962. With the success, he decided to make a casting and formed \"The Tijuana Brass\", with whom he toured and had a presentation on television. It was a musical collaboration with artists from Los Angeles, with style called \"Tijuana Marimba\u00b4s Brass\". The band was dissolved in 1969 but they continued with some presentations under the name of T.J.B. 55\nAt the end of the 60s and during the 70s, rock and roll still had great acceptance in the public. In those years bands such as \"The Moonlights\" had national and international recognition, who achieved successes such as \"Tijuana Funky\" or \"Are you\"; the \"Rockin Devils\", recognized for their Spanish cover of \"Bule Bule\", which achieved international success. The Roble Cinema, La Caba\u00f1a club and Flamingos club, would be some of the main stages of the decade for musical performances in the city.56\nIn the 70s, rock groups and musicians experienced government rejection and censorship for the lyrics of the songs. Romantic music took a boom and from there came bands like \"The Battle of Tijuana\", \"Los Solitarios\", \"Los Terr\u00edcolas\", \"Old Memories\", \"Tito Pantoja and his friends\", \"Ritmo 7\", \"Los Old Friends \",\" California Brass \"and \"Los Corazones Solitarios\", among others.\nIn the late 80s, Antonio De Carlo, was recognized as a revelation artist at the OTI Festival, having a successful career during the 90s, with songs such as \"In A Thousand Pieces\", \"A Pecho Discovery\", \"Revolution\" and \"Like It Hurts \". Lynda also gained national relevance in pop, achieving hits in songs like \"Lost Heart\", \"Tell\", \"A Thousand for an Hour\", among others.\nDespite the downturn in rock artists for some years, in the 90s Tijuana No! emerged, returning a bit of the genre to the city. They also incorporated ska, punk and reggae. \"No\" would be the first album released, from which successes like \"Pobre de ti\", which had Julieta Venegas as a vocalist, would emerge. Later the singer began her solo career already in the 00s of the 21st century. Her musical career reached the recording of six studio albums, and she won two Grammys, six Latin Grammys, six MTV Latin America and two Latin Music Billboard.\nThe city continued to be a hotbed of important rock bands, among them, especially at the international level, Specimen, other bands and prominent artists could be Ohtli, Nona Delichas, Canseco, Sonoro 2 and Headlongs. Electronic music boomed in the 90s, Murcof and the Nortec Collective, entered the scene and began to gain worldwide recognition for merging electronic music with northern and band music. This group was enriched with the visual contribution of designers and videographers who, under the same concept, provided images to this musical proposal.\nRegarding Mexican regional music, some groups of the northern genre were emerging, highlighting Los Tucanes de Tijuana, who since the 80s began their musical career until popularizing songs such as \"La Chona\", \"El Tucanazo\", \"La Chica Sexy\", among others. The Agua Caliente Band, Explosi\u00f3n Norte\u00f1a, among others, would be a new generation of Mexican popular music artists.\nAmong other things, Tijuana has been the inspiration for the birthplace of Nortec music style and Ruidoson, resulting in a very large and active electronic music scene where groups and artists like Los Macuanos, Maria y Jose, Siberium, Hidhawk and Harpocrates emerged. Tijuana also enjoys a large base of support in many other musical scenes such as mexican hip hop, reggae, hardcore, punk, black metal and house music. Famous musicians are from Tijuana including the pop-rock singer-songwriter Lynda Thomas and Vanessa Zamora and international indie punk bands like Delux and Los Kung-Fu Monkeys.\nTo promote the cultural development in children and youth of Tijuana, since 1996 the Tijuana Youth Symphony (SJT) has been promoted, which promotes education and musical training through instrument practices, music reading and public concerts. In addition, Tijuana has an opera season. There are also several musical festivals throughout the year, among which the Latin American Guitar Festival, Mainly Mozart Binacional, and the International Exhibition of contemporary dance \"Bodies in Transit\" stand out.\nTijuana is home to the Baja California Orchestra, one of the most prestigious and solid artistic institutions in northwestern Mexico, which was nominated for the Latin Grammy in the category of best classical album by the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Inc ., with the album Tango kills Danz\u00f3n kills Tango. This phonogram was distinguished as 'Best Classical Album of the year 2001' by the Mexican Union of Theater and Music Chroniclers. Currently, it maintains an annual season, offering symphonic and chamber music concerts in the most important forums of Tijuana and Baja California.\nAlready in the new century, many local bands have emerged, from all musical genres, some of them staying with local and national recognition. Highlights Nosis, High Slogan, Go Future, Ramona, The Children of the Saint, Among Deserts, Ziruela, Palos Verdes, Edwin, among others. Each of them have contributed and tried to revive the musical talent for which Tijuana has always been characterized.\nMusical clubs along the Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area and others often cater to a diverse range of tastes by offering nightly variations on musical fare, such as new wave music one night, and punk rock bands on the next. Some European metal bands whose members cannot perform in the United States due to prior felony convictions in their own countries play music festivals in Tijuana for fans from both Mexico and the United States.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city is home to the Tijuana Zonkeys professional basketball team of the CIBACOPA basketball league. The team is composed mostly of players from Mexico and plays from February to July in the Municipal Auditorium.\nThe city has a strong tradition of association football, Club Tijuana began playing in the Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n on the 2011/12 season, winning the 2012 Apertura title. They play their matches at the Estadio Caliente, a new 33,000 seat stadium. The team's mascot is the Xoloitzcuintle, a famous Mexican hairless dog.\nTijuana also has a long history of producing many world champion professional boxers, such as Antonio Margarito and Erik Morales.\n\n\n=== Stadiums ===\nEstadio Caliente\n\nThe stadium is the Estadio Caliente, match venue for Club Tijuana, a Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n football team. It is located in the Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Baja California (Mexico). Caliente Homes Stadium, is a multi-purpose center in Tijuana. It is mainly used for football matches, has a seating capacity of 21,000 spectators.  Opened in June 2008, according to the work schedule. It was a significant reason for Tijuana Club was promoted to the M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n; FEMEXFUT requires participating teams should have a stadium with a seating capacity of over 15,000. It is at this stage the U-17 FIBA Americas Championship 2009 was held bound for Nigeria. Was introduced in M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n during the Apertura 2011 tournament of the Mexican Football Federation.Estadio Chevron\n\nThe Chevron Stadium  is the home of the Toros de Tijuana. It opened in 1977 and housed the Colts missing Tijuana Mexican Pacific League. Subsequently, the stadium was used for football matches. For 2004, professional baseball returned, now with a franchise LMB under the name of Toros de Tijuana, which, the following year, changed its name to Colts as it had been known previously. At first the facility was called Cerro Colorado Stadium, due to its location at the foot of the hill of that name. With the return of baseball, chain supermarkets Calimax bought the naming rights to the stadium.  In 2004, the first season of Toros, the fans filled the stadium for most matches.  On April 4, 2013, the stadium was remodeled, marking the beginning of a new era for Toros de Tijuana.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\n\n\n==== Water ====\nThe Tijuana State Commission of Public Services (CESPT) supplies the city with its water, while the city receives its electricity from La Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE).\nIn 2019, due to extremely low water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir, CESPT began a city-wide water rationing scheme. This rationing scheme would divide Tijuana and nearby Rosarito into 5 zones. Each zone would be cut-off from the water supply on a rotating schedule of 4 days with water and 1 day without water. This scheme was expected to last for at least 2 months until the water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir were improved.\n\n\n==== Wastewater ====\nThe International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) developed, as a joint project of the USA and Mexico in the mid-1980s following substantial environmental studies, treats 25 million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Tijuana River; directly pumped across the border from the central collection point in Mexico. When the river is flowing, the diversion system of the plant begins operating and diverts up to about 12-13mgd to the IWTP. The total amount of water being diverted must not exceed 25 mgd, based on a monthly average decided upon by permit conditions, although the IWTP can treat sustained flows up to 45mgd daily and peaks of 70mgd for a short period. The diversion system regularly sends approximately six to eight million gallons of water daily to the IWTP. The plant is currently being upgraded to include a secondary treatment facility.\nThe city also four to five decentralize units that are part of the Tijuana/Rosarito Potable Water and Wastewater Master Plan. This plan was required as part of Public Law 106-457, put into order November 7, 2000, which was written to allow the Bajagua project to move forward. The master plan was a binational collaborative effort by EPA and CESPT and addressed San Diego-Tijuana's needs for the next 20 years. The plants are intended to treat approximately 5mgd each, to tertiary levels and provide the reclaimed water to the surrounding areas for agriculture, industry etc. There are several issues that they are facing: no infrastructure to convey the reclaimed water to customers and inadequate groundwater recharge infrastructure.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications ====\nTijuana's telephonic system operates under area code 664, but it is not the same area code 664 that is part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) because Mexico is not one of the countries represented in the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) where the country code is 1. So, to dial a phone number from San Diego to Tijuana requires an international access code and Mexico's Country Code, 52, before dialing the area code and the number.  It is similar for anyone calling from Tijuana to the United States.\nTelephonic landlines in Tijuana are provided by the company Telnor; other companies include Axtel, Izzi Telecom and Alestra. Popular cell phone carriers in the city-region include Movistar, Telcel, and AT&T Mexico. Many U.S. carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile offer free roaming in Mexico and it is possible to connect to U.S. based cell phone towers in many northern parts of the city. Cell phones also have historic usage in Tijuana as the first cellular call in Mexico was made in Tijuana in 1989.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nTijuana is a major gateway to the interior of Mexico to which it is connected by air and road directly, and by sea via the ports of Ensenada and San Diego. Within Tijuana there are freeways and other roads, and buses, but no passenger rail.\nLocal public transportation in Tijuana is run by semiprivate companies, and has one of the most complex, or perhaps unorganized networks.\n\n\n==== Air ====\nThe Tijuana International Airport (General Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez IA) is the city's main airport, one of the busiest in Mexico, and serves eleven airlines with destinations across Mexico and Shanghai, China. Tijuana Airport is also a second main airport for the San Diego area for passengers heading south into Mexico and Latin America, who may use the airport's Cross Border Xpress terminal located on the U.S. side of the border in Otay Mesa and connected to the rest of the airport on the Mexican side by a pedestrian toll bridge. U.S. and Canadian destinations can be reached via the San Diego International Airport, located about 35 kilometers (22 mi) north of the international border.\n\n\n==== Road ====\nTwo important Mexican federal highway corridors start in Tijuana, one of them is Fed 1, which runs south through the Baja California Peninsula through Rosarito Beach, Baja Mar, and Ensenada before ending in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. From Tijuana to Ensenada, most travelers take Fed 1D (scenic road), a four-lane, limited access toll road that runs by the coast starting at Playas de Tijuana. Fed 2 runs east for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) near the international border, as far as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua.\nWithin the metropolitan area the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 freeway connecte Mesa de Otay in the northeast of the city with Rosarito Beach in the southwest.\nJust north of the San Ysidro border crossing, Interstate 5 and Interstate 805 head northbound to San Diego and beyond. From the Otay Mesa border crossing, Interstate 905 takes drivers west to connect with both I-805 and I-5.\n\n\n==== Intercity buses ====\nThe city's main bus station is in its eastern borough. A small terminal downtown serves a few Mexican bus lines, and U.S.-based Greyhound Lines and Crucero USA. Another bus station near the border provides frequent service to Ensenada, and other major cities\u2014including Mazatl\u00e1n, Culiac\u00e1n, Hermosillo, and Guadalajara. Major bus lines operating in Tijuana include Azul y Blanco de Magallanes (Blue & White) and Transporte Efectivo Express de Tijuana \u2013 TEEXTI; modernizing system originally intended to phase out the other lines that partially introduced but ceased and merged with Azul y Blanco.\n\n\n==== Local buses ====\nIn 2006, Tijuana underwent a major overhaul of its existing system of guayines, or shared fixed-route station wagons, forcing the replacement of the guayines with new models of vans, serving as fixed-route taxis. Major transit hubs include Centro (Downtown Tijuana), Otay, Soler, and the Cinco y Diez avenues. Taxi lines operating in the city include Free Taxis, those that do not maintain a specific route; Economic Taxis; Diamond Taxis \u2013 black or yellow cabs; and regular taxis maintaining a set route. There are as many bus lines and routes as fixed-route taxi ones or calafias, and new routes for buses, taxis or calafias are frequently created, due to high demand of public transportation. Public transportation service is inexpensive, with bus tickets at maximum, USD $0.75. Fixed-route taxis are somewhat more expensive, depending on the taxi route, reaching USD $2.00. Bus, taxi and calafia lines and routes are distinguished from one another by their vehicles colors.\n\n\n==== Bus rapid transit ====\n\nA bus rapid transit system SITT operates one route from Downtown Tijuana and Garita Puerto Mexico near the San Ysidro Port of Entry, southeasterly along the Tijuana River to Terminal Insurgentes in the southeast of the city. It is part of a planned system of main and feeder lines to replace other buses and minibuses.\n\n\n==== Light rail ====\nPreviously there have been plans for a light rail service, for example in January 2009, the City Council and the Ministry of Communications and Transportation announced such a system along the Tijuana River, however so far nothing has come of these plans.There is, however, a light rail connection to downtown San Diego and beyond, starting immediately north of the San Ysidro Port of Entry to the U.S. at the San Ysidro Transit Center, where municipal buses also operate.\n\n\n==== Ride share ====\nRide share services Uber and DiDi operate throughout Tijuana and surrounding cities.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nTijuana has multiple sister cities and twin towns. These relations have been formalized by a variety of organizations as well as municipal governments. Currently twinned with the City of Tijuana are:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n Mexico portal\nTijuana Cartel\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nKun, Josh, and Fiamma Montezemolo, eds.

        "wiki": "Tijuana (US:  tee-(H)WAH-n\u0259, Spanish: [ti\u02c8xwana] (listen)) is the largest city of both Baja California State and the Baja California Peninsula. It is part of the San Diego\u2013Tijuana transborder urban agglomeration and the larger Southern California megalopolis. As the 6th-largest city in Mexico and center of the 6th-largest metro area in Mexico, Tijuana exerts a strong influence in education and politics \u2013 across Mexico, in transportation, culture and art \u2013  across all three Californias (the U.S. state of California, Baja California and Baja California Sur), and in manufacturing and as a migration hub \u2013 across the North American continent. Currently one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in Mexico, Tijuana maintains GaWC 'sufficiency city' status. As of 2015, the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,641,570.Tijuana is located on the Pacific coast of Baja California, and is the municipal seat and the cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality (Mexican states are divided into municipalities, rather than counties as in the U.S.). Tijuana covers 70% of the territory of the municipality and contains 80% of its population. A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent, the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies. In the early 21st century,  Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America. Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca. The city is the most visited border city in the world; sharing a border of about 24 km (15 mi) with its sister city San Diego. More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year. This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the fourth busiest land-border crossing in the world. It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone.Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico.  According to the 2015 census, the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico, with a population of 1,840,710, but rankings vary, the city (locality) itself was 6th largest and the municipality (administrative) 3rd largest nationally.  The international metropolitan region was estimated at about 5,158,459 in 2016, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region, 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas, and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico.  Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego.\nTijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias. As the American occupation of the Mexican capital ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Tijuana's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure. The city was founded on July 11, 1889 as urban development began. Often known by its supposed initials, T.J., and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico, the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe city's name comes from the rancho that Santiago Arg\u00fcello Moraga established in 1829 on his Mexican land grant, naming it Rancho T\u00eda Juana.The first Spanish mission call the settlement variously as La T\u00eda Juana, Tiguana, Tiuana, Tiwana, Tijuan, Ticuan, as well as Tijuana. While the Mexican city standardized to Tijuana, the American term for both the river and a U.S. settlement which is now part of San Ysidro remained T\u00eda Juana until the mid-20th century.\nThe commonly accepted theory among historians is that T\u00eda Juana, as Arg\u00fcello named his rancho, is derived from the word Tiwan (\"by the sea\") in the language of the Kumeyaay\u2014the original aboriginal inhabitants of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Urban legend, however, states that T\u00eda Juana, which means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, was a real person whose inn provided food and lodging to travelers. There is however no record of such an inn; in fact the first building in the area was built by Arg\u00fcello in any case, after naming his ranch Rancho T\u00eda Juana.\n\n\n=== Nicknames ===\nIn Southern California, Tijuana is often referred to as TJ or T.J. Baja Californians have adopted this pronunciation as Tiyei. In Spanish the demonym for someone from Tijuana is Tijuanense, while in English the demonym is Tijuanan. A very common slang term used for a person from Tijuana is Tijuanero.The nickname Tijuas is increasingly popular among residents and visitors alike. Due to a recent increase in violence in the city, a new term is developing. The phrase Yo Tijuaneo, \u00bfy t\u00fa? translates to I Tijuanate, and you?. This term comes from a new popular local verb Tijuanear meaning to Tijuana, describing the cosmopolitan aspects of living in the city and frequently crossing the border.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe land was originally inhabited by the Kumeyaay, a tribe of Yuman-speaking hunter-gatherers. Europeans arrived in 1542, when the explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo toured the coastline of the area, which Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno mapped in 1602. In 1769, Juan Cresp\u00ed documented more details about the area that was later called the Valley of Tijuana. Jun\u00edpero Serra founded the first mission of Alta California in nearby San Diego.\nFurther settlement took place near the end of the mission era when Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda, governor of the Baja California and Alta California, awarded a large land grant to Santiago Arg\u00fcello in 1829. This large cattle ranch, Rancho T\u00eda Juana, covered 100 km2 (40 sq mi). Although \"Tia Juana\" means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, the name was actually an adaptation of the word 'Tihuan' or 'Tiju\u00e1n' in the Kumeyaay language, the name of a nearby Kumeyaay settlement and whose meaning is disputed.In 1848, as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War with the United States, Mexico lost all of Alta California. The majority of the 1,000 Hispanic families living in Alta California stayed there, though some moved south to remain inside Mexico. Because of this Tijuana gained a different purpose on the international border. The area had been populated by ranchers, but Tijuana developed a new social economic structure. These were farming and livestock grazing, plus as a transit area for prospectors.\n\n\n=== 1889\u20131915: Town established ===\nUrban settlement began in 1889, when descendants of Santiago Arg\u00fcello and August\u00edn Olvera entered an agreement to begin developing the city of Tijuana. The date of the agreement, July 11, 1889, is recognized as the founding of the city. Tijuana saw its future in tourism from the beginning. From the late 19th century to the first few decades of the 20th century, the city attracted large numbers of Californians coming for trade and entertainment. The California land boom of the 1880s led to the first big wave of tourists, who were called \"excursionists\" and came looking for echoes of the famous novel \"Ramona\" by Helen Hunt Jackson.\nIn 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, revolutionaries claiming loyalty to Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n took over the city for shortly over a month. Federal troops then arrived. Assisted by the \"defensores de Tijuana\", they routed the revolutionaries, who fled north and were promptly arrested by the United States Army.\nThe Panama-California Exposition of 1915 brought many visitors to the nearby California city of San Diego. Tijuana attracted these tourists with a Feria T\u00edpica Mexicana \u2013 Typical Mexican Fair. This included curio shops, regional food, thermal baths, horse racing and boxing.\n\n\n=== 1916\u20131935: Gambling and drinking destination ===\nThe first professional race track opened in January 1916, just south of the border gate. It was almost immediately destroyed by the great \"Hatfield rainmaker\" flood of 1916. Rebuilt in the general area, it ran horse races until the new Agua Caliente track opened in 1929, several miles south and across the river on higher ground.\nLegal drinking and gambling attracted U.S nationals in the 1920s during Prohibition. The Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area became the city's tourist center, with casinos and the Hotel Caesar's, birthplace of the Caesar salad.\nIn 1925, the city by presidential decree changed his name to   ciudad Zaragoza, but its name reverted to Tijuana in 1929.\nIn 1928, the Agua Caliente Touristic Complex was opened, including hotel, spa, dog-track, private airport, golf course and gambling casino. A year later, the new Agua Caliente Racetrack joined the complex. During the eight years it operated, the Agua Caliente hotel, casino and spa achieved a near mythical status, with Hollywood stars and gangsters flying in and playing. Rita Hayworth was discovered there. Musical nightclub productions were broadcast over the radio. A singer known as \"la Faraona\" got shot in a love-triangle and gave birth to the myth of a beautiful lady ghost. Remnants of the Agua Caliente casino can be seen in the outdoor swimming pool and the \"minarete\" (actually a former incinerator chimney) nearby the southern end of Avenida Sanchez Taboada, on the grounds of what is now the Lazaro Cardenas educational complex.\n\n\n=== 1935\u20131965: Tourism broadens ===\nIn 1935, President C\u00e1rdenas decreed an end to gambling and casinos in Baja California, and the Agua Caliente complex faltered, then closed. In 1939, it was reopened as a junior high school (now, Preparatoria L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas). The buildings themselves were torn down in the 1970s and replaced by modern scholastic architecture.\nWith increased tourism and a large number of Mexican citizens relocating to Tijuana, the city's population grew from 21,971 to 65,364 between 1940 and 1950.\n\nWith the decline of nightlife and tourism in the 1950s, the city restructured its tourist industry, by promoting a more family-oriented scene. Tijuana developed a greater variety of attractions and activities to offer its visitors.\n\n\n=== 1965\u20132001: The city matures ===\nIn 1965 the Mexican federal government launched the Border Industrialization Program to attract foreign investment. Tijuana and other border cities became attractive for foreign companies to open maquiladoras (factories), and the Tijuana economy started to diversify. Manufacturing jobs attracted workers from other parts of Mexico and the city's population grew from less than half a million in 1980 to almost 1 million in 1985.\nIn 1972, work began on the first concrete channeling of the Tijuana River; previously the river would flood across a wide plain east and southeast of downtown, inundating an area of wood, cardboard and metal shacks called Cartolandia (\u201cPaperland\u201d).  The project removed the shacks and added 1.8 million sq. m. of usable land, on which the Zona R\u00edo was built. With the 1981 opening of the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana mall and the 1982 Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT), Zona R\u00edo became the new commercial center of a modern Tijuana, and with its new boulevards with monument-filled glorietas (roundabouts), reminiscent of the grand Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, the city created the new image and allure of a modern, large city, rather than just a border town focused on tourism and vice.In 1994, PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana while making an appearance in the plaza of Lomas Taurinas, a neighborhood nestled in a valley near Centro. The shooter was caught and imprisoned, but doubts remain about who the mastermind might have been.\n\n\n=== 2001\u20132011: Violence and decline of US tourism ===\nAfter 9/11, tighter US border controls resulted in hours-long waits to return to the US. The number of US visitors dropped sharply due to this factor, as well as subsequent drug violence.Around 2008, thousands of Tijuana's elite bought houses in and moved to Bonita and Eastlake in Chula Vista, California to escape violence, kidnapping and other crimes taking place during that period. An article in The Los Angeles Times reported that the emigration to San Diego County has transformed the demographic and cultural character of some cities to a degree.\n\n\n=== 2011\u2013present: Tijuana strengthens ===\nIn recent years, Tijuana has become an important city of commerce and migration for Mexico and US. In spite of the violence and border crossing issues, the city has received a large number of tourists from US, China, Japan and the south of Mexico. Thanks to the realization of cultural and business festivals, the city has improved its image before the world, standing out as a competitive city for investment. Currently, the commercial and business sector is committed to the boom in the gastronomic industry, craft beer, entertainment and real estate, as well as medical tourism, to attract visitors and investors.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTijuana is the westernmost city in Mexico, and consequently in Latin America, and the second largest city of northern Mexico. Located about 210 kilometers (130 mi) west of the state capital, Mexicali, the city is bordered to the north by the cities of Imperial Beach, and the San Diego neighborhoods of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, California. To the southwest of the city is Rosarito Beach, while to the south is unincorporated territory of Tijuana Municipality. The city is nestled among hills, canyons, and gullies. The central part of the city lies in a valley through which flows the channeled Tijuana River.\nHousing development in the Tijuana Hills has led to eradication of many seasonal mountain streams. This lack of natural drainage makes places within the city vulnerable to landslides during the rainy season. The varied terrain of Tijuana gives the city elevation extremes that range from sea level to 790 meters (2,590 ft).\nTijuana is noted for its rough terrain, which includes many canyons, steep hills, and mesas. Among noted canyons in Tijuana are Canyon K and Canyon Johnson. Large Tijuana hills include Red Hill (Cerro Colorado) and Hill of the Bees (Cerro de las Abejas) in the eastern part of the city.\nThe city is located near the terminus of the Tijuana River and within the Tijuana River Basin. The Tijuana River is an intermittent river, 195 km (121 mi) long, on the Pacific coast of northern Baja California in Mexico and Southern California in the United States. It drains an arid area along the California\u2013Baja California border, flowing through Mexico for most of its course and then crossing the border for the last 8 km (5 mi) of its course where it forms an estuary that empties into the ocean. The river's lower reaches harbor the last undeveloped coastal wetlands in San Diego County, and some of the last in Southern California, amidst a highly urbanized environment at the southern city limits of Imperial Beach.\nAs downtown Tijuana was built at the bottom of the river valley, the district is subject to seasonal flooding created by drain-off from the Tijuana Hills. During this time, east-bound portions of the Via Rapida (east-west highway) may be blocked off by the Tijuana Police due to hazardous conditions.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city's skyscraper history is relatively recent. Some of the first highrise building complexes constructed in the city were the twin towers of Grand Hotel Tijuana. Tijuana experienced a building boom that was brought to a halt by the Great Recession. Among buildings that succumbed to the time period was the Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico that would have been located in Playas and reached 98 m (322 ft). Currently the tallest building, and soon to be the largest complex in footage, New City Residential reaches 102 m (335 ft). Overall, the city maintains 33 completed structures with other proposed and under-construction skyscrapers.\n\nThe Tijuana skyline is the fifth largest skyline in Mexico and is located in the Zona Rio and to a smaller extent, Playas de Tijuana. In the Zona Rio the buildings are concentrated on the Tijuana River, lined parallel to the river; and on the edges of the Tijuana Country Club. In Playas the high rises are currently focused on the coast. Recent construction on high rises has begun in the aforementioned areas, as buildings such as New City Residential and Grand Hotel Tijuana have been developed and taken prominent places in the skyline as the tallest buildings. From Tijuana's skyline the San Diego skyline can also be seen, although the reverse is mostly not true on account of the high hills surrounding central Tijuana.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Tijuana is divided into eight administrative boroughs, or Delegaciones. The Tijuana metropolitan area occupies all of borough seats. The boroughs are in turn divided into colonias or ejidos. These boroughs offer administrative services such as urban planning, civil registry, inspection, verification, public works and community development and are served by a delegado.\n\nCentro \u2014 \"Delegaci\u00f3n Centro\" includes the old downtown (Zona Centro), new business district (Zona R\u00edo), red light district (Zona Norte), and other adjacent neighborhoods (\"zonas\"). This is the historical midpoint of Tijuana; the municipal palace is located here as well as most of the tourist zones, such as Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n and the business district. The Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT for CEntro CUltural de Tijuana) is located here as well as the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana, until recently the largest mall in the state, within the Zona Rio.\nCerro Colorado \u2014 The Cerro Colorado (\"Red Hill\") is located here and it is surrounded by houses. Because of its height many of the area's antennae for radio and television stations are located on its peak.\nLa Mesa \u2014 This is where the Morelos Park, the largest public park in the city, is located, as well as the retail and transit hub Cinco y Diez, Plaza Mundo Divertido, the new Macroplaza and the CETYS University.\nOtay Centenario \u2014 This borough was created in 2014 by merging Mesa de Otay and Centenario boroughs. In this borough sits the Tijuana International Airport.  The Tijuana campus of the Autonomous University of Baja California and the Technologico are also located here as well as many maquiladoras. This is the borough with the largest number of factories and maquiladoras. Its largest colony is Ciudad Industrial (\"Industrial City\"). Three of the city's most important streets, Boulevard Bellas Artes, Boulevard Industrial and Fed 2, are located here.  This delegacion contains the Otay Mesa entry to the United States and the Friendship Park (Parque de la amistad).\nPlayas de Tijuana \u2014 This is the westernmost borough of the city bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the United States border on the north. This is where the beaches of Tijuana are located (hence the name) and it is also one of the two exits to the south towards Rosarito and Ensenada.\nLa Presa \u2014 literally \"'the dam'\", this is the largest borough in size and the Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez Dam is located within its limits, hence its name. The new Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 and the Tijuana-Tecate freeways run through it.\nSan Antonio de los Buenos \u2014 This is mostly a residential area although it also has two industrial parks.\nSanchez Taboada \u2014 Like the previous borough this is mostly a residential area, but within its borders are located many \"maquiladoras\" specially at Pacific Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTijuana's climate is a semi-arid (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh), with about 231 mm (9.09 in) of annual precipitation, and generally mild to warm weather year-round. It has characteristics of the Mediterranean climate (Csa) found to the immediate north, with most of the annual precipitation falling in the winter, between the months of November and March.\n\nBetween November and March, storms originate from fronts entering off of the Pacific Ocean. January is the wettest month of the year for the city and during this time a periodic event, similar to June Gloom, is observed created by marine layer. January is the coolest month, during which temperatures average 13.6 \u00b0C (56.5 \u00b0F). In the city April signifies the end of winter and the start of Santa Ana winds. Though the daytime highs are generally around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), heat waves can reach up to 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F). The hottest months in the city are August and September, during which temperatures average 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Summers are by far the driest time of year since influences from the California Current and the North Pacific High suppress the formation of rainfall caused by the North American Monsoon. As in coastal Southern California, air pollution sometimes occurs during periods of temperature inversion, especially during summer and fall, but (unlike Mexico City) is seldom severe and in recent years has lessened due to cleaner car engines.Frost and snow are rare phenomena in the city as temperatures are usually well above freezing. Yet, in December 1967, snow fell in the city and in January 2007 feather light snow fell in the east of the city. However, excessive amounts of snow fall have never been recorded in the city. On February 14, 2008 a winter storm caused an unusual snowfall in the upper reaches of the hills of the city.\nThe record low temperature recorded in the city was \u22126 \u00b0C (21 \u00b0F), while the highest was 49 \u00b0C (120 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nTijuana has a diverse cosmopolitan population which includes migrants from other parts of Mexico and from all over the world. Tijuana has one of Mexico's largest Asian populations, predominantly consisting of Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese immigrants. Tijuana also has a large and rapidly growing population of United States citizens, mostly from Southern California.  Many Latin Americans, notably Cubans, and Guatemalans, have made Tijuana their home. The city also has many Lebanese, Italian, French, Spanish citizens. Recently, the city has received a large influx of Haitian immigrants.\n\nThe majority of Tijuana's migrant Mexican population hail from Sinaloa, Michoac\u00e1n, Jalisco, Oaxaca, and the Federal District. Because of the diversity of Mexico and the influx of immigrants from almost every region in the country, there are no accurate estimates on ethnicity or race of the current population. The heavy influx of immigrants to the city and municipality of Tijuana has led to job creation in the form of over 700 twin-plant (maquiladora) factories, which serve as the basis of employment for the majority of the working-class people in northern Mexico.  The high poverty level in Tijuana is attributed to the city's \"magnet status\" for people who have come from the poorer south of the nation and citizens from other nations seeking to escape from extreme poverty.  Tijuana holds a status that provides the possibility of employment as well as higher education and the dream of crossing the border.  Tijuana and Baja California in general have much stronger economies and higher incomes than other Mexican cities along the United States border, as well as more moderate weather.\nTijuana today is one of the fastest growing cities in Mexico with an average of 80,000 people moving to Tijuana yearly.  In terms of area, the city grows by approximately three hectares a day, mostly east and south as the city is mostly built out to the beach already with the exception of some canyons.  Along with settlements separated from Tijuana proper and other communities unimproved land, big business moves in providing supermarkets and retail to marginal areas, along with paved roads.  The city experiences the construction of 26,000 new settlers a year that has led to the unregulated, illegal squatter homes that takes place in the hills and valleys of ever expanding Tijuana, most of these areas are still without city services like sidewalks, paving, streetlights, and public transit. This is an ongoing process: as older and existing squatter areas are brought into the city services, more marginal areas become occupied by squatters.\nSquatter areas are home to displaced and uprooted people, among them the indigenous and poverty stricken, as well as migrants deported from the USA, many of whom are also without Mexican citizenship.  In recent years, working-class suburban housing estates have sprung up in the fringes to provide a sense of safety and land ownership.  These suburbs enable young families to isolate their families from the violence of the drug war and squatter areas.  These outlying communities tend to be much better equipped than their squatter counterparts.  Nevertheless, some remote areas are drug plantations for narcotics, and delinquency has spread to areas once considered safe havens.  These issues occasionally come to light in the newspapers.\nNational Population Council (CONAPO) data has estimated that by 2030, growth rates maintaining, the city will become the second largest in Mexico and anchor to the fourth largest metropolitan area in Mexico. The suburban sprawl observed in Tijuana leaves the downtown and beach areas relatively affluent.\n\nWhile the INEGI Census 2010 placed Tijuana's population at 1.3 million, only two percent more than in 2005 Census, Tijuana City Council estimates from 2010 place the population closer to two million, at 1.6 million. As funding for cities is based on the populace of the city, the Council worries about receiving adequate funds to provide for the needs of the city.  The population discrepancies may be explained by a few factors.  Shanty towns that have not been rasterized and an undercount, people having left Tijuana for United States, and people leaving Tijuana for the interior of Mexico due to the intensification of the drug war, and suburbanization outside city limits but still inside the municipality.  Tijuana, because of the dreams of border crossers, and its relatively higher wages compared to the rest of Mexico, naturally attracts immigrants.  Since an improvement in security since 2011, the population of Tijuana as reflected in the 2015 Mexican census is expected to return to its normal growth curve; the great reduction in violence should make the settlement of Tijuana an attractive option again versus fringe valleys, nevertheless exact figures from the census await.\nAccording to the Second Census of Population and Housing of the year 2010 conducted by the INEGI (National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics) the municipality of Tijuana has 1,559,683 inhabitants within 879 km2, the city or settlement of Tijuana only covers \u2154 of that area.  While the metropolitan area of Tijuana (1392 km2), composed of Tijuana Municipality and Rosarito Beach Municipality, has 1,751,302 inhabitants. Tecate Municipality, adjacent to Tijuana Municipality, has not yet been considered by the government as part of the metropolitan area.  However, there is great economic and cultural exchange between the cities regions though there are still expanses of rural land. As Tijuana grows, many of its suburbs have been built increasingly inland, and in the direction of Tecate; Valley of the Palms is a large planned city between the two.\nAs of 2005 the large majority of the city's population, 96%, adhere to the beliefs of Christianity. The denominations are further divided into followers of Catholicism \u2013 61% \u2013 and of Protestantism \u2013 35%.  While other beliefs occupying a 4% margin in the city include Taoism (among other Asian and European religions), atheism and agnosticism is also found.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nTijuana is the birthplace and base of the Tijuana Cartel.  From 2007 through 2010, Tijuana experienced an unusually high level of violent crime related to gang violence, in part derived from the Mexican drug war and human trafficking.  Homicides peaked in 2010, when 844 people were killed, compared with 355 in 2004 and 349 in the first eight months of 2011. Reportedly, the wave of violence resulted from a turf war as the administration of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n weakened the local Arellano F\u00e9lix cartel; violence slowed when the larger Sinaloa cartel took control.During peak years of violent crime in the city, gun battles between rival cartels, and between cartels and the police, erupted in public. In April 2008, police found 1,500 shell casings on various streets after one battle left 13 suspected drug traffickers dead. In 2009 and depending on the source, Tijuana Municipality experienced either 556 or 1,118 murders, mostly as a result of the drug war.There were 492 murders in 2013, a 48% increase in the homicide rate between 2012 and 2013. This was the highest number of murders since 2010. By the end of 2017, the number of murders in Tijuana increased to 1,744, which was almost double those in 2016.As of 2018, Tijuana had the highest per capita rate for homicides in the world at 138 murders per 100,000 people.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Region ===\n\nAt present the parties with greater presence in Tijuana are the National Action Party (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). The PAN has been the dominant party in the city for 20 years. Historically the PRI had been the dominant party in regional politics, until 1989 when the PAN began to dominate the city, until yet again, in 2004, PRI began regaining prominence and won the Mayor's Office.\nLess prominent parties also maintain relations with the dominant parties. These other parties, with less presence include the New Alliance Party (PANAL), Social Encounter Party (PES), and Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Allied with the PAN at the state and local level under the Alliance for Baja California are the Social Encounter Party (PES) and New Alliance Party (PANAL). Allied with the PRI at the state and local level under the \"Alliance for Better Living\" are the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) and Baja California State Party (PEBC).\n\n\n=== International ===\nTijuana's importance and rise to a global city has led to its recognition among countries worldwide. In addition to international cultural recognition, Tijuana has received political recognition and is a developing a political center currently host to eight consulates from European, Asian, and North American countries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\n\nTijuana is a large manufacturing center, and in addition to tourism, it serves as a cornerstone of the city economy. In the past decade alone, Tijuana became the medical device manufacture capital of the North American continent, surpassing previous leader Minneapolis - Saint Paul.The city's proximity to Southern California and its large, skilled, diverse, and relatively inexpensive workforce make it an attractive city for foreign companies looking to establish extensive industrial parks composed of assembly plants that are called maquiladoras, even more so than other cities in the US-Mexican border zone, taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to export products. At its peak, in 2001 Tijuana had roughly 820 of these 'maquiladoras'. Foreign and domestic companies employ thousands of employees in these plants, usually in assembly-related labor. Such jobs are not demanding but typically offer above average salaries for Mexico, with most maqiladoras jobs beginning at Mex$100 per day (about 5 US dollars, as of September 2016), significantly above the Mexican minimum wage of Mex$57.46 (about 3 US dollars, as of September 2016). Companies that have set up maquiladoras in Tijuana include Lanix, Hyundai, Sony, Vortec, BMW, Vizio, Toyota, Dell, Samsung, Kodak, Matsushita/Panasonic, GE, Nabisco, Ford, Microsoft, Cemex, Zonda, Philips, Pioneer, Airbus, Plantronics, Siemens Mexico, Jaguar, Pall Medical, Tara, Sanyo and Volkswagen. Many of the maquiladoras are located in the Otay Mesa and Florido sections of Tijuana.\nEconomic development has its central business district at Zona R\u00edo, which together, with the corridor along Blvd. Agua Caliente (the extension of Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n), contains the majority of the higher-end office space in the city.\n\n\n=== Tourist economy and entertainment ===\nTijuana also relies on tourism for a major part of its revenue. About 300,000 visitors cross by foot or car from the San Ysidro point of entry in the United States every day. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs, and shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are part of the draw for the city's tourists, many located within walking distance of the border. The city's tourist centers include Downtown Tijuana including the nightlife hot spots around La Sexta, Avenida Revolucion, souvenir shopping at the Mercado de Artesan\u00edas and Plaza Viva Tijuana, Tijuana's Cultural Center (CECUT) and neighboring Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana shopping center, and the city's best known vices, in the form of its legal Red Light District and gambling (Agua Caliente). Mexico's drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college aged Southern Californians who tend to stay on Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n.\nTijuana is also known for its red-light district Zona Norte (also referred to as La Coahuila after one of its main streets) with legal prostitution in strip clubs and on the street. The strip clubs are typically full-contact, meaning the dancers let patrons fondle them. Many dancers also sell their sexual services. In a 1999 estimation, there were 15,000 women engaged in prostitution in Tijuana outside of clubs and brothels.Tijuana has many pharmacies that target visitors from the United States, which sell some medicines without prescriptions and/or at much lower costs than in the U.S. Many medications still require a Mexican prescription, which can be obtained from adjacent doctors' offices. People filling up prescriptions for drugs classified in the US as Schedule II or Schedule III have found it more difficult to locate such medications, and the purchase of pseudoephedrine also has become restricted by Tijuana pharmacies, just as in the U.S. To fill a prescription in Tijuana for any drug covered by the US Controlled Substances Act  and legally bring it into the United States requires a prescription from the United States for re-import.  Americans can import up to a 90-day supply of non-controlled medications for personal use to the USA from Mexico and other countries.\nBusinesses such as auto detailing, medical and dental services and plastic surgery are heavily marketed, and are usually much less expensive than in the U.S.\nTijuana is headquarters for Mexico's largest gambling concern, Grupo Caliente, which operates the only casinos in the city, more than twenty branches.Tourists are sometimes robbed by municipal police.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nPlaza Rio Tijuana is a large regional mall anchored by Cin\u00e9polis, Sanborns, S\u00faper DAX and Sears.\nAll across the city, there are dozens of plazas comerciales, which may be strip malls or small enclosed or open-air centers, with a combination of any or all of the following anchors:\n\none of the 26 Tijuana branches of the small department store Coppel,\na supermarket or hypermarket,\na cin\u00e9polis or cinemex multicinema,\na branch of the electronics and motorcycle retailer ElektraAn important concentration of plazas is in the Cinco y Diez around an eponymous intersection, named for a former American-style five and dime store that was located there. It is also a major hub for public transit. Plaza Carrousel, with its namesake merry-go-round, is located here.\nCostco, Sam's Club, and Walmart each have multiple branches across the city.\nTraditional markets with vendors include the large Mercado Hidalgo in Zona R\u00edo, smaller neighborhood markets and the Mercado Municipal downtown.\nTijuana was the headquarters of 14-store Dorian's department store chain until its demise in 2009; most were converted to Sears stores.\n\n\n=== Culinary ===\nTijuana, along with the nearby Valle de Guadalupe, has recently become a culinary hotspot due to its Baja Med cuisine, including chefs such as Javier Plascencia, but also for its tacos, other street food, food trucks, coffee houses and artisanal beer.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTijuana is home to many private Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and High Schools as well as nationally high ranked colleges and universities. Notable primary and secondary schools include Metropolitan, Instituto M\u00e9xico, Instituto Cumbres, President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas School, Agua Caliente School Center High, Polit\u00e9cnico de Baja California(CLUB DE QU\u00cdMICA), Jos\u00e9 Fimbres Moreno School and the State High School, and Ignacio Ram\u00edrez School located in Cerro Colorado. These schools maintain recognition for their demands and high standards.\nTijuana maintains multiple higher education institutions. These include the Autonomous University of Baja California, Tijuana (UABC), Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Tijuana (ITT), Universidad Iberoamericana (UIA-Tijuana), CETYS Universidad, Universidad Xochicalco, and University of the Californias. Other colleges include Tijuana University Center, Tijuana University of Technology, Graduate Center of the Northwest, and the University of Professional Development. The city is the seat of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), an institution of scientific research and higher education, specializing in the study of the problems in the border region between Mexico and the United States. In August 2009, Metropolitan UABC opened in Valle de Las Palmas, in the Tijuana metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Culture and contemporary life ==\nMany foreigners travel to Tijuana to drink and dance, buy prescription drugs, purchase bootleg brand-name clothing, timepieces, and other personal accessories found globally, as well as manufactured and hand-crafted local curiosities. Locals and regular tourists avoid hassles by visiting the clubs at Plaza Fiesta or other areas of the Zona R\u00edo without the crowds, heavy marketing, and occasional tourist misbehavior or outright lawbreaking common on the Revoluci\u00f3n strip. However, Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n has been known for its proliferation of nightclub shows, primarily catering to casual tourists. While still an entertaining town with an enjoyable atmosphere, some locals and tourists feel it has lost an \"anything goes\" atmosphere, that was dangerous to locals, tourists, and the tourism industry.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nAs Tijuana matured from a tourist-oriented border town into one of Mexico's largest cities, the 1982 opening of the Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT) marked a milestone. CECUT's mission was to strengthening Tijuana's image, both to US visitors and to Mexicans, as a destination for culture and not only shopping and vice. The center includes an OMNIMAX cinema showing IMAX films, the Museum of the Californias, contemporary art exhibition halls, a restaurant, caf\u00e9, bookstore,  and other cultural facilities.\nLa Casa de la Cultura cultural center comprises a school, a theater, and a public library, and teaches dance, painting, music, plastic arts, photography and languages.\nOther cultural venues include the Instituto Municipal de Arte y Cultura (Municipal Institute of Art and Culture), the Tijuana Wax Museum, the Museo El Trompo (Trompo Museum), and El Foro, the former Jai Alai Palace, that is now a concert venue. Concerts are also held at the Estadio Caliente stadium, Hip\u00f3dromo Agua Caliente Racetrack, and at the \"Audiorama\" at the Museo El Trompo children's museum of science and technology.The Tijuana Country Club (Club Campestre de Tijuana) has many affluent members and a famous golf course and also functions as an entertainment and events venue. Tijuana also has a large Rotary Club.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\nParque Morelos has a small zoo and park space; Parque de la Amistad in Otay Centenario has a small pond, and a running and dirt-bike track. Parque Teniente Guerrero is a downtown park with a public library and weekend entertainment by clowns.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nTijuana's nightlife scene is one of the city's strongest attractions. The area surrounding \"La Sexta\", the intersection at Calle Sexta and Av. Revoluci\u00f3n, is now a major hub of new bars and dance clubs. Zona Rio, Tijuana's new Downtown, is home to some of the city's finest restaurants and bars. Another capstone of Tijuana's entertainment offerings is its adult nightlife industry, which includes the city's red light district as well as less conspicuous adult entertainment venues.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nTijuana also has a very active and independent artist community whose internationally recognized work has earned Tijuana the title of \"one of the most important new cultural meccas\", according to Newsweek, an exhibition of Tijuana's current art scene, is being curated by the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and is traveling across the USA in 2006 and 2007. Art collectives like Bulbo and film production like Palenque Filmaciones explore the use of film like the award-winning Tijuana Makes Me Happy, media like television bulbo TV and print \"bulbo PRESS\", to show different realities of Tijuana out of Mexico. In 2004, Tijuana earned international acclaim for an art exhibition displayed on the cement banks of the Tijuana River and along the Mexico/U.S. border fence in Otay Mesa.\nGraffiti is widespread in Tijuana. They can range from free-hand writing in spray can and marker form, often carrying social or sexual commentary in English or Spanish, pictures in wheatpaste and stencils, consisting of stenciled renderings of personalities crucial to Hispanic culture from past and present eras, such as television news announcers or stars, but also extending to images of artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed. Graffiti in Tijuana may seem at first to consist largely of simplistic tags and thus not as technically evolved, colorful, or accepted in the mainstream as the \"pieces\" of graffiti scenes of the United States, Europe, or Japan, but large, colorful graffiti murals adorn walls from both native Tijuanan artists as well as visiting graffiti writers, especially from California. The Tijuanan art pieces show as much prowess and skill as those made by their more renowned U.S. counterparts, although illicit graffiti are strongly discouraged by the Tijuana government, as in other major metropolitan areas.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nSince the decade of the 1920s, Tijuana has excelled in the musical field, thanks to the first groups of ranchera music that began to set the tourist establishments in the area with the visit of foreigners, including the former Casino Agua Caliente.\nRock music was very popular and popular among young people in the mid-50s, leaving the ranch rhythm aside years ago. Another event that added the arrival of Rock to Tijuana was the visit of the African-American pianist and guitarist, Gene Ross, who came to play at the Convoy Club on Revolution Avenue. The presence of this artist was the beginning of the rock scene in the region that marked a new style in the country.54 Some groupings of the nascent Mexican rock began, an example of which was \"The Tijuana Five\", who made some covers in Spanish of Anglo-Saxon successes.\nJavier Batiz founded in 1957 he founded a group called \"Los TJ's\" with which he collected musical influences that were received in the Mexican border cities of black music, blues and R&B from people like T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin 'Wolf, James Brown, among others. Later he would start his solo career in the rest of the country and participating in some bands in Mexico City.\nDuring the 60s, the American trumpeter Herb Alpert, in a visit to the bullfights made in the old Bullfight, found musical inspiration so after the recording of his single \"The Lonely Bull\", which was a radio hit in 1962. With the success, he decided to make a casting and formed \"The Tijuana Brass\", with whom he toured and had a presentation on television. It was a musical collaboration with artists from Los Angeles, with style called \"Tijuana Marimba\u00b4s Brass\". The band was dissolved in 1969 but they continued with some presentations under the name of T.J.B. 55\nAt the end of the 60s and during the 70s, rock and roll still had great acceptance in the public. In those years bands such as \"The Moonlights\" had national and international recognition, who achieved successes such as \"Tijuana Funky\" or \"Are you\"; the \"Rockin Devils\", recognized for their Spanish cover of \"Bule Bule\", which achieved international success. The Roble Cinema, La Caba\u00f1a club and Flamingos club, would be some of the main stages of the decade for musical performances in the city.56\nIn the 70s, rock groups and musicians experienced government rejection and censorship for the lyrics of the songs. Romantic music took a boom and from there came bands like \"The Battle of Tijuana\", \"Los Solitarios\", \"Los Terr\u00edcolas\", \"Old Memories\", \"Tito Pantoja and his friends\", \"Ritmo 7\", \"Los Old Friends \",\" California Brass \"and \"Los Corazones Solitarios\", among others.\nIn the late 80s, Antonio De Carlo, was recognized as a revelation artist at the OTI Festival, having a successful career during the 90s, with songs such as \"In A Thousand Pieces\", \"A Pecho Discovery\", \"Revolution\" and \"Like It Hurts \". Lynda also gained national relevance in pop, achieving hits in songs like \"Lost Heart\", \"Tell\", \"A Thousand for an Hour\", among others.\nDespite the downturn in rock artists for some years, in the 90s Tijuana No! emerged, returning a bit of the genre to the city. They also incorporated ska, punk and reggae. \"No\" would be the first album released, from which successes like \"Pobre de ti\", which had Julieta Venegas as a vocalist, would emerge. Later the singer began her solo career already in the 00s of the 21st century. Her musical career reached the recording of six studio albums, and she won two Grammys, six Latin Grammys, six MTV Latin America and two Latin Music Billboard.\nThe city continued to be a hotbed of important rock bands, among them, especially at the international level, Specimen, other bands and prominent artists could be Ohtli, Nona Delichas, Canseco, Sonoro 2 and Headlongs. Electronic music boomed in the 90s, Murcof and the Nortec Collective, entered the scene and began to gain worldwide recognition for merging electronic music with northern and band music. This group was enriched with the visual contribution of designers and videographers who, under the same concept, provided images to this musical proposal.\nRegarding Mexican regional music, some groups of the northern genre were emerging, highlighting Los Tucanes de Tijuana, who since the 80s began their musical career until popularizing songs such as \"La Chona\", \"El Tucanazo\", \"La Chica Sexy\", among others. The Agua Caliente Band, Explosi\u00f3n Norte\u00f1a, among others, would be a new generation of Mexican popular music artists.\nAmong other things, Tijuana has been the inspiration for the birthplace of Nortec music style and Ruidoson, resulting in a very large and active electronic music scene where groups and artists like Los Macuanos, Maria y Jose, Siberium, Hidhawk and Harpocrates emerged. Tijuana also enjoys a large base of support in many other musical scenes such as mexican hip hop, reggae, hardcore, punk, black metal and house music. Famous musicians are from Tijuana including the pop-rock singer-songwriter Lynda Thomas and Vanessa Zamora and international indie punk bands like Delux and Los Kung-Fu Monkeys.\nTo promote the cultural development in children and youth of Tijuana, since 1996 the Tijuana Youth Symphony (SJT) has been promoted, which promotes education and musical training through instrument practices, music reading and public concerts. In addition, Tijuana has an opera season. There are also several musical festivals throughout the year, among which the Latin American Guitar Festival, Mainly Mozart Binacional, and the International Exhibition of contemporary dance \"Bodies in Transit\" stand out.\nTijuana is home to the Baja California Orchestra, one of the most prestigious and solid artistic institutions in northwestern Mexico, which was nominated for the Latin Grammy in the category of best classical album by the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Inc ., with the album Tango kills Danz\u00f3n kills Tango. This phonogram was distinguished as 'Best Classical Album of the year 2001' by the Mexican Union of Theater and Music Chroniclers. Currently, it maintains an annual season, offering symphonic and chamber music concerts in the most important forums of Tijuana and Baja California.\nAlready in the new century, many local bands have emerged, from all musical genres, some of them staying with local and national recognition. Highlights Nosis, High Slogan, Go Future, Ramona, The Children of the Saint, Among Deserts, Ziruela, Palos Verdes, Edwin, among others. Each of them have contributed and tried to revive the musical talent for which Tijuana has always been characterized.\nMusical clubs along the Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area and others often cater to a diverse range of tastes by offering nightly variations on musical fare, such as new wave music one night, and punk rock bands on the next. Some European metal bands whose members cannot perform in the United States due to prior felony convictions in their own countries play music festivals in Tijuana for fans from both Mexico and the United States.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city is home to the Tijuana Zonkeys professional basketball team of the CIBACOPA basketball league. The team is composed mostly of players from Mexico and plays from February to July in the Municipal Auditorium.\nThe city has a strong tradition of association football, Club Tijuana began playing in the Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n on the 2011/12 season, winning the 2012 Apertura title. They play their matches at the Estadio Caliente, a new 33,000 seat stadium. The team's mascot is the Xoloitzcuintle, a famous Mexican hairless dog.\nTijuana also has a long history of producing many world champion professional boxers, such as Antonio Margarito and Erik Morales.\n\n\n=== Stadiums ===\nEstadio Caliente\n\nThe stadium is the Estadio Caliente, match venue for Club Tijuana, a Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n football team. It is located in the Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Baja California (Mexico). Caliente Homes Stadium, is a multi-purpose center in Tijuana. It is mainly used for football matches, has a seating capacity of 21,000 spectators.  Opened in June 2008, according to the work schedule. It was a significant reason for Tijuana Club was promoted to the M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n; FEMEXFUT requires participating teams should have a stadium with a seating capacity of over 15,000. It is at this stage the U-17 FIBA Americas Championship 2009 was held bound for Nigeria. Was introduced in M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n during the Apertura 2011 tournament of the Mexican Football Federation.Estadio Chevron\n\nThe Chevron Stadium  is the home of the Toros de Tijuana. It opened in 1977 and housed the Colts missing Tijuana Mexican Pacific League. Subsequently, the stadium was used for football matches. For 2004, professional baseball returned, now with a franchise LMB under the name of Toros de Tijuana, which, the following year, changed its name to Colts as it had been known previously. At first the facility was called Cerro Colorado Stadium, due to its location at the foot of the hill of that name. With the return of baseball, chain supermarkets Calimax bought the naming rights to the stadium.  In 2004, the first season of Toros, the fans filled the stadium for most matches.  On April 4, 2013, the stadium was remodeled, marking the beginning of a new era for Toros de Tijuana.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\n\n\n==== Water ====\nThe Tijuana State Commission of Public Services (CESPT) supplies the city with its water, while the city receives its electricity from La Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE).\nIn 2019, due to extremely low water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir, CESPT began a city-wide water rationing scheme. This rationing scheme would divide Tijuana and nearby Rosarito into 5 zones. Each zone would be cut-off from the water supply on a rotating schedule of 4 days with water and 1 day without water. This scheme was expected to last for at least 2 months until the water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir were improved.\n\n\n==== Wastewater ====\nThe International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) developed, as a joint project of the USA and Mexico in the mid-1980s following substantial environmental studies, treats 25 million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Tijuana River; directly pumped across the border from the central collection point in Mexico. When the river is flowing, the diversion system of the plant begins operating and diverts up to about 12-13mgd to the IWTP. The total amount of water being diverted must not exceed 25 mgd, based on a monthly average decided upon by permit conditions, although the IWTP can treat sustained flows up to 45mgd daily and peaks of 70mgd for a short period. The diversion system regularly sends approximately six to eight million gallons of water daily to the IWTP. The plant is currently being upgraded to include a secondary treatment facility.\nThe city also four to five decentralize units that are part of the Tijuana/Rosarito Potable Water and Wastewater Master Plan. This plan was required as part of Public Law 106-457, put into order November 7, 2000, which was written to allow the Bajagua project to move forward. The master plan was a binational collaborative effort by EPA and CESPT and addressed San Diego-Tijuana's needs for the next 20 years. The plants are intended to treat approximately 5mgd each, to tertiary levels and provide the reclaimed water to the surrounding areas for agriculture, industry etc. There are several issues that they are facing: no infrastructure to convey the reclaimed water to customers and inadequate groundwater recharge infrastructure.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications ====\nTijuana's telephonic system operates under area code 664, but it is not the same area code 664 that is part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) because Mexico is not one of the countries represented in the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) where the country code is 1. So, to dial a phone number from San Diego to Tijuana requires an international access code and Mexico's Country Code, 52, before dialing the area code and the number.  It is similar for anyone calling from Tijuana to the United States.\nTelephonic landlines in Tijuana are provided by the company Telnor; other companies include Axtel, Izzi Telecom and Alestra. Popular cell phone carriers in the city-region include Movistar, Telcel, and AT&T Mexico. Many U.S. carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile offer free roaming in Mexico and it is possible to connect to U.S. based cell phone towers in many northern parts of the city. Cell phones also have historic usage in Tijuana as the first cellular call in Mexico was made in Tijuana in 1989.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nTijuana is a major gateway to the interior of Mexico to which it is connected by air and road directly, and by sea via the ports of Ensenada and San Diego. Within Tijuana there are freeways and other roads, and buses, but no passenger rail.\nLocal public transportation in Tijuana is run by semiprivate companies, and has one of the most complex, or perhaps unorganized networks.\n\n\n==== Air ====\nThe Tijuana International Airport (General Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez IA) is the city's main airport, one of the busiest in Mexico, and serves eleven airlines with destinations across Mexico and Shanghai, China. Tijuana Airport is also a second main airport for the San Diego area for passengers heading south into Mexico and Latin America, who may use the airport's Cross Border Xpress terminal located on the U.S. side of the border in Otay Mesa and connected to the rest of the airport on the Mexican side by a pedestrian toll bridge. U.S. and Canadian destinations can be reached via the San Diego International Airport, located about 35 kilometers (22 mi) north of the international border.\n\n\n==== Road ====\nTwo important Mexican federal highway corridors start in Tijuana, one of them is Fed 1, which runs south through the Baja California Peninsula through Rosarito Beach, Baja Mar, and Ensenada before ending in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. From Tijuana to Ensenada, most travelers take Fed 1D (scenic road), a four-lane, limited access toll road that runs by the coast starting at Playas de Tijuana. Fed 2 runs east for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) near the international border, as far as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua.\nWithin the metropolitan area the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 freeway connecte Mesa de Otay in the northeast of the city with Rosarito Beach in the southwest.\nJust north of the San Ysidro border crossing, Interstate 5 and Interstate 805 head northbound to San Diego and beyond. From the Otay Mesa border crossing, Interstate 905 takes drivers west to connect with both I-805 and I-5.\n\n\n==== Intercity buses ====\nThe city's main bus station is in its eastern borough. A small terminal downtown serves a few Mexican bus lines, and U.S.-based Greyhound Lines and Crucero USA. Another bus station near the border provides frequent service to Ensenada, and other major cities\u2014including Mazatl\u00e1n, Culiac\u00e1n, Hermosillo, and Guadalajara. Major bus lines operating in Tijuana include Azul y Blanco de Magallanes (Blue & White) and Transporte Efectivo Express de Tijuana \u2013 TEEXTI; modernizing system originally intended to phase out the other lines that partially introduced but ceased and merged with Azul y Blanco.\n\n\n==== Local buses ====\nIn 2006, Tijuana underwent a major overhaul of its existing system of guayines, or shared fixed-route station wagons, forcing the replacement of the guayines with new models of vans, serving as fixed-route taxis. Major transit hubs include Centro (Downtown Tijuana), Otay, Soler, and the Cinco y Diez avenues. Taxi lines operating in the city include Free Taxis, those that do not maintain a specific route; Economic Taxis; Diamond Taxis \u2013 black or yellow cabs; and regular taxis maintaining a set route. There are as many bus lines and routes as fixed-route taxi ones or calafias, and new routes for buses, taxis or calafias are frequently created, due to high demand of public transportation. Public transportation service is inexpensive, with bus tickets at maximum, USD $0.75. Fixed-route taxis are somewhat more expensive, depending on the taxi route, reaching USD $2.00. Bus, taxi and calafia lines and routes are distinguished from one another by their vehicles colors.\n\n\n==== Bus rapid transit ====\n\nA bus rapid transit system SITT operates one route from Downtown Tijuana and Garita Puerto Mexico near the San Ysidro Port of Entry, southeasterly along the Tijuana River to Terminal Insurgentes in the southeast of the city. It is part of a planned system of main and feeder lines to replace other buses and minibuses.\n\n\n==== Light rail ====\nPreviously there have been plans for a light rail service, for example in January 2009, the City Council and the Ministry of Communications and Transportation announced such a system along the Tijuana River, however so far nothing has come of these plans.There is, however, a light rail connection to downtown San Diego and beyond, starting immediately north of the San Ysidro Port of Entry to the U.S. at the San Ysidro Transit Center, where municipal buses also operate.\n\n\n==== Ride share ====\nRide share services Uber and DiDi operate throughout Tijuana and surrounding cities.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nTijuana has multiple sister cities and twin towns. These relations have been formalized by a variety of organizations as well as municipal governments. Currently twinned with the City of Tijuana are:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n Mexico portal\nTijuana Cartel\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nKun, Josh, and Fiamma Montezemolo, eds.

To the south of this place is the Playas de Tijuana, Baja California.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 1850s, in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War, a joint commission from the United States and Mexico erected a pyramidal statue on a beachside bluff south of what is today Imperial Beach, California to mark the initial boundary point between Mexico and the United States. \nOn August 18, 1971, the surrounding area in the United States was inaugurated as a California State Park by First Lady Pat Nixon. Celebrating the first phase of what was envisioned as \"International Friendship Park,\" Mrs. Nixon declared, \"I hope there won't be a fence too long here.\"Until 1994, there was only a simple barbed wire fence, and Americans and Mexicans could meet on the border under the supervision of the U.S. Border Patrol. Various social events have taken place in this park, including yoga classes, religious services, weddings, dances and baptisms.In 1994 amidst widespread fear of illegal immigration in the area, a fourteen-mile fence was constructed on the border between San Diego and Tijuana as part of Operation Gatekeeper, including one in Friendship Park. Border security was tightened in the 1990s and again after the September 11 terrorism attacks in 2001. During that time, people on opposite sides of the border were still able to touch and pass objects through the barrier.In 2009, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security closed down Friendship Park and a second parallel fence was created which stretches into the Pacific Ocean that includes barbed wires, sensors, and surveillance cameras. A 20-foot wide border patrol access road was also created, along with a third 20-foot wall of steel bars. In late 2011 and early 2012, the \u201cSurf Fence\u201d Project replaced the old bars that form a barrier on the beach and extended it 300 feet into the ocean.\nIn 2012, under pressure from the public and activist groups, the federal government agreed to reopen the park with an outer perimeter fence blocking access to the public except when permitted by the U.S. Border Patrol, which controls access to the park. The fence dividing the two countries is now a thick, dense steel mesh that is difficult to see through and only allows the touching of fingertips.\n\n\n=== Children's Day ===\nAt the private request of the humanitarian organization Border Angels, the U.S. government allowed a gate in the fence at Friendship Park to be opened briefly on Children's Day, a holiday celebrated in April in Mexico. The first such event took place in 2013, and it was repeated in 2015 and 2016. Border Patrol officers lifted a steel girder that locks a solitary gate in the fence from the U.S. side. Children and adults from a small number of pre-selected families divided by the border were allowed to meet and embrace briefly. San Diego Customs Border Protection (CBP) Sector chief Rodney Scott announced in April 2018 that the door opening event would no longer be allowed to take place.  The reason for this decision was that Border Angels founder Enrique Morones had arranged for a wedding to take place, and the groom was a convicted, major drug smuggler.  Border Patrol agents attended the wedding, which received widespread local, national and international media coverage. This was a great embarrassment for the San Diego CBP sector command.  The Children's Day event is no longer being allowed, and it did not change the terms of access for the thousands of families who visit Friendship Park each year for the purpose of reuniting with their families. \n\n\n== Visiting Friendship Park ==\n\n\n=== U.S. side ===\nThe U.S. Border Patrol allows public access to the park on Saturdays and Sundays between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Visitors to the park must first enter Border Field State Park on Monument Road either by vehicle or, if vehicle access is closed, by foot for 1.8 miles to reach the park at Monument Mesa. Border Patrol may limit access to the number of visitors allowed in the park and may check IDs. No item can be passed through the fence; this includes food, money, gifts, and notes, and doing so is a customs violation.\n\n\n=== Mexico side ===\nThere is no access limitation to the park from the Mexico side.\n\n\n== Friends of Friendship Park ==\nFriends of Friendship Park is an organization of community members working for unrestricted access to this historic border site.  The organization works on behalf of many families who depend on the park to see their families and friends.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nInitial Point of Boundary Between U.S. and Mexico\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFriends of Friendship Park",

        "wiki": "Tijuana (US:  tee-(H)WAH-n\u0259, Spanish: [ti\u02c8xwana] (listen)) is the largest city of both Baja California State and the Baja California Peninsula. It is part of the San Diego\u2013Tijuana transborder urban agglomeration and the larger Southern California megalopolis. As the 6th-largest city in Mexico and center of the 6th-largest metro area in Mexico, Tijuana exerts a strong influence in education and politics \u2013 across Mexico, in transportation, culture and art \u2013  across all three Californias (the U.S. state of California, Baja California and Baja California Sur), and in manufacturing and as a migration hub \u2013 across the North American continent. Currently one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in Mexico, Tijuana maintains GaWC 'sufficiency city' status. As of 2015, the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,641,570.Tijuana is located on the Pacific coast of Baja California, and is the municipal seat and the cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality (Mexican states are divided into municipalities, rather than counties as in the U.S.). Tijuana covers 70% of the territory of the municipality and contains 80% of its population. A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent, the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies. In the early 21st century,  Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America. Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca. The city is the most visited border city in the world; sharing a border of about 24 km (15 mi) with its sister city San Diego. More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year. This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the fourth busiest land-border crossing in the world. It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone.Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico.  According to the 2015 census, the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico, with a population of 1,840,710, but rankings vary, the city (locality) itself was 6th largest and the municipality (administrative) 3rd largest nationally.  The international metropolitan region was estimated at about 5,158,459 in 2016, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region, 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas, and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico.  Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego.\nTijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias. As the American occupation of the Mexican capital ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Tijuana's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure. The city was founded on July 11, 1889 as urban development began. Often known by its supposed initials, T.J., and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico, the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe city's name comes from the rancho that Santiago Arg\u00fcello Moraga established in 1829 on his Mexican land grant, naming it Rancho T\u00eda Juana.The first Spanish mission call the settlement variously as La T\u00eda Juana, Tiguana, Tiuana, Tiwana, Tijuan, Ticuan, as well as Tijuana. While the Mexican city standardized to Tijuana, the American term for both the river and a U.S. settlement which is now part of San Ysidro remained T\u00eda Juana until the mid-20th century.\nThe commonly accepted theory among historians is that T\u00eda Juana, as Arg\u00fcello named his rancho, is derived from the word Tiwan (\"by the sea\") in the language of the Kumeyaay\u2014the original aboriginal inhabitants of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Urban legend, however, states that T\u00eda Juana, which means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, was a real person whose inn provided food and lodging to travelers. There is however no record of such an inn; in fact the first building in the area was built by Arg\u00fcello in any case, after naming his ranch Rancho T\u00eda Juana.\n\n\n=== Nicknames ===\nIn Southern California, Tijuana is often referred to as TJ or T.J. Baja Californians have adopted this pronunciation as Tiyei. In Spanish the demonym for someone from Tijuana is Tijuanense, while in English the demonym is Tijuanan. A very common slang term used for a person from Tijuana is Tijuanero.The nickname Tijuas is increasingly popular among residents and visitors alike. Due to a recent increase in violence in the city, a new term is developing. The phrase Yo Tijuaneo, \u00bfy t\u00fa? translates to I Tijuanate, and you?. This term comes from a new popular local verb Tijuanear meaning to Tijuana, describing the cosmopolitan aspects of living in the city and frequently crossing the border.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe land was originally inhabited by the Kumeyaay, a tribe of Yuman-speaking hunter-gatherers. Europeans arrived in 1542, when the explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo toured the coastline of the area, which Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno mapped in 1602. In 1769, Juan Cresp\u00ed documented more details about the area that was later called the Valley of Tijuana. Jun\u00edpero Serra founded the first mission of Alta California in nearby San Diego.\nFurther settlement took place near the end of the mission era when Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda, governor of the Baja California and Alta California, awarded a large land grant to Santiago Arg\u00fcello in 1829. This large cattle ranch, Rancho T\u00eda Juana, covered 100 km2 (40 sq mi). Although \"Tia Juana\" means \"Aunt Jane\" in Spanish, the name was actually an adaptation of the word 'Tihuan' or 'Tiju\u00e1n' in the Kumeyaay language, the name of a nearby Kumeyaay settlement and whose meaning is disputed.In 1848, as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War with the United States, Mexico lost all of Alta California. The majority of the 1,000 Hispanic families living in Alta California stayed there, though some moved south to remain inside Mexico. Because of this Tijuana gained a different purpose on the international border. The area had been populated by ranchers, but Tijuana developed a new social economic structure. These were farming and livestock grazing, plus as a transit area for prospectors.\n\n\n=== 1889\u20131915: Town established ===\nUrban settlement began in 1889, when descendants of Santiago Arg\u00fcello and August\u00edn Olvera entered an agreement to begin developing the city of Tijuana. The date of the agreement, July 11, 1889, is recognized as the founding of the city. Tijuana saw its future in tourism from the beginning. From the late 19th century to the first few decades of the 20th century, the city attracted large numbers of Californians coming for trade and entertainment. The California land boom of the 1880s led to the first big wave of tourists, who were called \"excursionists\" and came looking for echoes of the famous novel \"Ramona\" by Helen Hunt Jackson.\nIn 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, revolutionaries claiming loyalty to Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n took over the city for shortly over a month. Federal troops then arrived. Assisted by the \"defensores de Tijuana\", they routed the revolutionaries, who fled north and were promptly arrested by the United States Army.\nThe Panama-California Exposition of 1915 brought many visitors to the nearby California city of San Diego. Tijuana attracted these tourists with a Feria T\u00edpica Mexicana \u2013 Typical Mexican Fair. This included curio shops, regional food, thermal baths, horse racing and boxing.\n\n\n=== 1916\u20131935: Gambling and drinking destination ===\nThe first professional race track opened in January 1916, just south of the border gate. It was almost immediately destroyed by the great \"Hatfield rainmaker\" flood of 1916. Rebuilt in the general area, it ran horse races until the new Agua Caliente track opened in 1929, several miles south and across the river on higher ground.\nLegal drinking and gambling attracted U.S nationals in the 1920s during Prohibition. The Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area became the city's tourist center, with casinos and the Hotel Caesar's, birthplace of the Caesar salad.\nIn 1925, the city by presidential decree changed his name to   ciudad Zaragoza, but its name reverted to Tijuana in 1929.\nIn 1928, the Agua Caliente Touristic Complex was opened, including hotel, spa, dog-track, private airport, golf course and gambling casino. A year later, the new Agua Caliente Racetrack joined the complex. During the eight years it operated, the Agua Caliente hotel, casino and spa achieved a near mythical status, with Hollywood stars and gangsters flying in and playing. Rita Hayworth was discovered there. Musical nightclub productions were broadcast over the radio. A singer known as \"la Faraona\" got shot in a love-triangle and gave birth to the myth of a beautiful lady ghost. Remnants of the Agua Caliente casino can be seen in the outdoor swimming pool and the \"minarete\" (actually a former incinerator chimney) nearby the southern end of Avenida Sanchez Taboada, on the grounds of what is now the Lazaro Cardenas educational complex.\n\n\n=== 1935\u20131965: Tourism broadens ===\nIn 1935, President C\u00e1rdenas decreed an end to gambling and casinos in Baja California, and the Agua Caliente complex faltered, then closed. In 1939, it was reopened as a junior high school (now, Preparatoria L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas). The buildings themselves were torn down in the 1970s and replaced by modern scholastic architecture.\nWith increased tourism and a large number of Mexican citizens relocating to Tijuana, the city's population grew from 21,971 to 65,364 between 1940 and 1950.\n\nWith the decline of nightlife and tourism in the 1950s, the city restructured its tourist industry, by promoting a more family-oriented scene. Tijuana developed a greater variety of attractions and activities to offer its visitors.\n\n\n=== 1965\u20132001: The city matures ===\nIn 1965 the Mexican federal government launched the Border Industrialization Program to attract foreign investment. Tijuana and other border cities became attractive for foreign companies to open maquiladoras (factories), and the Tijuana economy started to diversify. Manufacturing jobs attracted workers from other parts of Mexico and the city's population grew from less than half a million in 1980 to almost 1 million in 1985.\nIn 1972, work began on the first concrete channeling of the Tijuana River; previously the river would flood across a wide plain east and southeast of downtown, inundating an area of wood, cardboard and metal shacks called Cartolandia (\u201cPaperland\u201d).  The project removed the shacks and added 1.8 million sq. m. of usable land, on which the Zona R\u00edo was built. With the 1981 opening of the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana mall and the 1982 Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT), Zona R\u00edo became the new commercial center of a modern Tijuana, and with its new boulevards with monument-filled glorietas (roundabouts), reminiscent of the grand Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, the city created the new image and allure of a modern, large city, rather than just a border town focused on tourism and vice.In 1994, PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana while making an appearance in the plaza of Lomas Taurinas, a neighborhood nestled in a valley near Centro. The shooter was caught and imprisoned, but doubts remain about who the mastermind might have been.\n\n\n=== 2001\u20132011: Violence and decline of US tourism ===\nAfter 9/11, tighter US border controls resulted in hours-long waits to return to the US. The number of US visitors dropped sharply due to this factor, as well as subsequent drug violence.Around 2008, thousands of Tijuana's elite bought houses in and moved to Bonita and Eastlake in Chula Vista, California to escape violence, kidnapping and other crimes taking place during that period. An article in The Los Angeles Times reported that the emigration to San Diego County has transformed the demographic and cultural character of some cities to a degree.\n\n\n=== 2011\u2013present: Tijuana strengthens ===\nIn recent years, Tijuana has become an important city of commerce and migration for Mexico and US. In spite of the violence and border crossing issues, the city has received a large number of tourists from US, China, Japan and the south of Mexico. Thanks to the realization of cultural and business festivals, the city has improved its image before the world, standing out as a competitive city for investment. Currently, the commercial and business sector is committed to the boom in the gastronomic industry, craft beer, entertainment and real estate, as well as medical tourism, to attract visitors and investors.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTijuana is the westernmost city in Mexico, and consequently in Latin America, and the second largest city of northern Mexico. Located about 210 kilometers (130 mi) west of the state capital, Mexicali, the city is bordered to the north by the cities of Imperial Beach, and the San Diego neighborhoods of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, California. To the southwest of the city is Rosarito Beach, while to the south is unincorporated territory of Tijuana Municipality. The city is nestled among hills, canyons, and gullies. The central part of the city lies in a valley through which flows the channeled Tijuana River.\nHousing development in the Tijuana Hills has led to eradication of many seasonal mountain streams. This lack of natural drainage makes places within the city vulnerable to landslides during the rainy season. The varied terrain of Tijuana gives the city elevation extremes that range from sea level to 790 meters (2,590 ft).\nTijuana is noted for its rough terrain, which includes many canyons, steep hills, and mesas. Among noted canyons in Tijuana are Canyon K and Canyon Johnson. Large Tijuana hills include Red Hill (Cerro Colorado) and Hill of the Bees (Cerro de las Abejas) in the eastern part of the city.\nThe city is located near the terminus of the Tijuana River and within the Tijuana River Basin. The Tijuana River is an intermittent river, 195 km (121 mi) long, on the Pacific coast of northern Baja California in Mexico and Southern California in the United States. It drains an arid area along the California\u2013Baja California border, flowing through Mexico for most of its course and then crossing the border for the last 8 km (5 mi) of its course where it forms an estuary that empties into the ocean. The river's lower reaches harbor the last undeveloped coastal wetlands in San Diego County, and some of the last in Southern California, amidst a highly urbanized environment at the southern city limits of Imperial Beach.\nAs downtown Tijuana was built at the bottom of the river valley, the district is subject to seasonal flooding created by drain-off from the Tijuana Hills. During this time, east-bound portions of the Via Rapida (east-west highway) may be blocked off by the Tijuana Police due to hazardous conditions.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nThe city's skyscraper history is relatively recent. Some of the first highrise building complexes constructed in the city were the twin towers of Grand Hotel Tijuana. Tijuana experienced a building boom that was brought to a halt by the Great Recession. Among buildings that succumbed to the time period was the Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico that would have been located in Playas and reached 98 m (322 ft). Currently the tallest building, and soon to be the largest complex in footage, New City Residential reaches 102 m (335 ft). Overall, the city maintains 33 completed structures with other proposed and under-construction skyscrapers.\n\nThe Tijuana skyline is the fifth largest skyline in Mexico and is located in the Zona Rio and to a smaller extent, Playas de Tijuana. In the Zona Rio the buildings are concentrated on the Tijuana River, lined parallel to the river; and on the edges of the Tijuana Country Club. In Playas the high rises are currently focused on the coast. Recent construction on high rises has begun in the aforementioned areas, as buildings such as New City Residential and Grand Hotel Tijuana have been developed and taken prominent places in the skyline as the tallest buildings. From Tijuana's skyline the San Diego skyline can also be seen, although the reverse is mostly not true on account of the high hills surrounding central Tijuana.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Tijuana is divided into eight administrative boroughs, or Delegaciones. The Tijuana metropolitan area occupies all of borough seats. The boroughs are in turn divided into colonias or ejidos. These boroughs offer administrative services such as urban planning, civil registry, inspection, verification, public works and community development and are served by a delegado.\n\nCentro \u2014 \"Delegaci\u00f3n Centro\" includes the old downtown (Zona Centro), new business district (Zona R\u00edo), red light district (Zona Norte), and other adjacent neighborhoods (\"zonas\"). This is the historical midpoint of Tijuana; the municipal palace is located here as well as most of the tourist zones, such as Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n and the business district. The Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT for CEntro CUltural de Tijuana) is located here as well as the Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana, until recently the largest mall in the state, within the Zona Rio.\nCerro Colorado \u2014 The Cerro Colorado (\"Red Hill\") is located here and it is surrounded by houses. Because of its height many of the area's antennae for radio and television stations are located on its peak.\nLa Mesa \u2014 This is where the Morelos Park, the largest public park in the city, is located, as well as the retail and transit hub Cinco y Diez, Plaza Mundo Divertido, the new Macroplaza and the CETYS University.\nOtay Centenario \u2014 This borough was created in 2014 by merging Mesa de Otay and Centenario boroughs. In this borough sits the Tijuana International Airport.  The Tijuana campus of the Autonomous University of Baja California and the Technologico are also located here as well as many maquiladoras. This is the borough with the largest number of factories and maquiladoras. Its largest colony is Ciudad Industrial (\"Industrial City\"). Three of the city's most important streets, Boulevard Bellas Artes, Boulevard Industrial and Fed 2, are located here.  This delegacion contains the Otay Mesa entry to the United States and the Friendship Park (Parque de la amistad).\nPlayas de Tijuana \u2014 This is the westernmost borough of the city bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the United States border on the north. This is where the beaches of Tijuana are located (hence the name) and it is also one of the two exits to the south towards Rosarito and Ensenada.\nLa Presa \u2014 literally \"'the dam'\", this is the largest borough in size and the Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez Dam is located within its limits, hence its name. The new Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 and the Tijuana-Tecate freeways run through it.\nSan Antonio de los Buenos \u2014 This is mostly a residential area although it also has two industrial parks.\nSanchez Taboada \u2014 Like the previous borough this is mostly a residential area, but within its borders are located many \"maquiladoras\" specially at Pacific Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTijuana's climate is a semi-arid (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh), with about 231 mm (9.09 in) of annual precipitation, and generally mild to warm weather year-round. It has characteristics of the Mediterranean climate (Csa) found to the immediate north, with most of the annual precipitation falling in the winter, between the months of November and March.\n\nBetween November and March, storms originate from fronts entering off of the Pacific Ocean. January is the wettest month of the year for the city and during this time a periodic event, similar to June Gloom, is observed created by marine layer. January is the coolest month, during which temperatures average 13.6 \u00b0C (56.5 \u00b0F). In the city April signifies the end of winter and the start of Santa Ana winds. Though the daytime highs are generally around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), heat waves can reach up to 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F). The hottest months in the city are August and September, during which temperatures average 22.0 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Summers are by far the driest time of year since influences from the California Current and the North Pacific High suppress the formation of rainfall caused by the North American Monsoon. As in coastal Southern California, air pollution sometimes occurs during periods of temperature inversion, especially during summer and fall, but (unlike Mexico City) is seldom severe and in recent years has lessened due to cleaner car engines.Frost and snow are rare phenomena in the city as temperatures are usually well above freezing. Yet, in December 1967, snow fell in the city and in January 2007 feather light snow fell in the east of the city. However, excessive amounts of snow fall have never been recorded in the city. On February 14, 2008 a winter storm caused an unusual snowfall in the upper reaches of the hills of the city.\nThe record low temperature recorded in the city was \u22126 \u00b0C (21 \u00b0F), while the highest was 49 \u00b0C (120 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nTijuana has a diverse cosmopolitan population which includes migrants from other parts of Mexico and from all over the world. Tijuana has one of Mexico's largest Asian populations, predominantly consisting of Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese immigrants. Tijuana also has a large and rapidly growing population of United States citizens, mostly from Southern California.  Many Latin Americans, notably Cubans, and Guatemalans, have made Tijuana their home. The city also has many Lebanese, Italian, French, Spanish citizens. Recently, the city has received a large influx of Haitian immigrants.\n\nThe majority of Tijuana's migrant Mexican population hail from Sinaloa, Michoac\u00e1n, Jalisco, Oaxaca, and the Federal District. Because of the diversity of Mexico and the influx of immigrants from almost every region in the country, there are no accurate estimates on ethnicity or race of the current population. The heavy influx of immigrants to the city and municipality of Tijuana has led to job creation in the form of over 700 twin-plant (maquiladora) factories, which serve as the basis of employment for the majority of the working-class people in northern Mexico.  The high poverty level in Tijuana is attributed to the city's \"magnet status\" for people who have come from the poorer south of the nation and citizens from other nations seeking to escape from extreme poverty.  Tijuana holds a status that provides the possibility of employment as well as higher education and the dream of crossing the border.  Tijuana and Baja California in general have much stronger economies and higher incomes than other Mexican cities along the United States border, as well as more moderate weather.\nTijuana today is one of the fastest growing cities in Mexico with an average of 80,000 people moving to Tijuana yearly.  In terms of area, the city grows by approximately three hectares a day, mostly east and south as the city is mostly built out to the beach already with the exception of some canyons.  Along with settlements separated from Tijuana proper and other communities unimproved land, big business moves in providing supermarkets and retail to marginal areas, along with paved roads.  The city experiences the construction of 26,000 new settlers a year that has led to the unregulated, illegal squatter homes that takes place in the hills and valleys of ever expanding Tijuana, most of these areas are still without city services like sidewalks, paving, streetlights, and public transit. This is an ongoing process: as older and existing squatter areas are brought into the city services, more marginal areas become occupied by squatters.\nSquatter areas are home to displaced and uprooted people, among them the indigenous and poverty stricken, as well as migrants deported from the USA, many of whom are also without Mexican citizenship.  In recent years, working-class suburban housing estates have sprung up in the fringes to provide a sense of safety and land ownership.  These suburbs enable young families to isolate their families from the violence of the drug war and squatter areas.  These outlying communities tend to be much better equipped than their squatter counterparts.  Nevertheless, some remote areas are drug plantations for narcotics, and delinquency has spread to areas once considered safe havens.  These issues occasionally come to light in the newspapers.\nNational Population Council (CONAPO) data has estimated that by 2030, growth rates maintaining, the city will become the second largest in Mexico and anchor to the fourth largest metropolitan area in Mexico. The suburban sprawl observed in Tijuana leaves the downtown and beach areas relatively affluent.\n\nWhile the INEGI Census 2010 placed Tijuana's population at 1.3 million, only two percent more than in 2005 Census, Tijuana City Council estimates from 2010 place the population closer to two million, at 1.6 million. As funding for cities is based on the populace of the city, the Council worries about receiving adequate funds to provide for the needs of the city.  The population discrepancies may be explained by a few factors.  Shanty towns that have not been rasterized and an undercount, people having left Tijuana for United States, and people leaving Tijuana for the interior of Mexico due to the intensification of the drug war, and suburbanization outside city limits but still inside the municipality.  Tijuana, because of the dreams of border crossers, and its relatively higher wages compared to the rest of Mexico, naturally attracts immigrants.  Since an improvement in security since 2011, the population of Tijuana as reflected in the 2015 Mexican census is expected to return to its normal growth curve; the great reduction in violence should make the settlement of Tijuana an attractive option again versus fringe valleys, nevertheless exact figures from the census await.\nAccording to the Second Census of Population and Housing of the year 2010 conducted by the INEGI (National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics) the municipality of Tijuana has 1,559,683 inhabitants within 879 km2, the city or settlement of Tijuana only covers \u2154 of that area.  While the metropolitan area of Tijuana (1392 km2), composed of Tijuana Municipality and Rosarito Beach Municipality, has 1,751,302 inhabitants. Tecate Municipality, adjacent to Tijuana Municipality, has not yet been considered by the government as part of the metropolitan area.  However, there is great economic and cultural exchange between the cities regions though there are still expanses of rural land. As Tijuana grows, many of its suburbs have been built increasingly inland, and in the direction of Tecate; Valley of the Palms is a large planned city between the two.\nAs of 2005 the large majority of the city's population, 96%, adhere to the beliefs of Christianity. The denominations are further divided into followers of Catholicism \u2013 61% \u2013 and of Protestantism \u2013 35%.  While other beliefs occupying a 4% margin in the city include Taoism (among other Asian and European religions), atheism and agnosticism is also found.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nTijuana is the birthplace and base of the Tijuana Cartel.  From 2007 through 2010, Tijuana experienced an unusually high level of violent crime related to gang violence, in part derived from the Mexican drug war and human trafficking.  Homicides peaked in 2010, when 844 people were killed, compared with 355 in 2004 and 349 in the first eight months of 2011. Reportedly, the wave of violence resulted from a turf war as the administration of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n weakened the local Arellano F\u00e9lix cartel; violence slowed when the larger Sinaloa cartel took control.During peak years of violent crime in the city, gun battles between rival cartels, and between cartels and the police, erupted in public. In April 2008, police found 1,500 shell casings on various streets after one battle left 13 suspected drug traffickers dead. In 2009 and depending on the source, Tijuana Municipality experienced either 556 or 1,118 murders, mostly as a result of the drug war.There were 492 murders in 2013, a 48% increase in the homicide rate between 2012 and 2013. This was the highest number of murders since 2010. By the end of 2017, the number of murders in Tijuana increased to 1,744, which was almost double those in 2016.As of 2018, Tijuana had the highest per capita rate for homicides in the world at 138 murders per 100,000 people.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Region ===\n\nAt present the parties with greater presence in Tijuana are the National Action Party (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). The PAN has been the dominant party in the city for 20 years. Historically the PRI had been the dominant party in regional politics, until 1989 when the PAN began to dominate the city, until yet again, in 2004, PRI began regaining prominence and won the Mayor's Office.\nLess prominent parties also maintain relations with the dominant parties. These other parties, with less presence include the New Alliance Party (PANAL), Social Encounter Party (PES), and Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Allied with the PAN at the state and local level under the Alliance for Baja California are the Social Encounter Party (PES) and New Alliance Party (PANAL). Allied with the PRI at the state and local level under the \"Alliance for Better Living\" are the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) and Baja California State Party (PEBC).\n\n\n=== International ===\nTijuana's importance and rise to a global city has led to its recognition among countries worldwide. In addition to international cultural recognition, Tijuana has received political recognition and is a developing a political center currently host to eight consulates from European, Asian, and North American countries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\n\nTijuana is a large manufacturing center, and in addition to tourism, it serves as a cornerstone of the city economy. In the past decade alone, Tijuana became the medical device manufacture capital of the North American continent, surpassing previous leader Minneapolis - Saint Paul.The city's proximity to Southern California and its large, skilled, diverse, and relatively inexpensive workforce make it an attractive city for foreign companies looking to establish extensive industrial parks composed of assembly plants that are called maquiladoras, even more so than other cities in the US-Mexican border zone, taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to export products. At its peak, in 2001 Tijuana had roughly 820 of these 'maquiladoras'. Foreign and domestic companies employ thousands of employees in these plants, usually in assembly-related labor. Such jobs are not demanding but typically offer above average salaries for Mexico, with most maqiladoras jobs beginning at Mex$100 per day (about 5 US dollars, as of September 2016), significantly above the Mexican minimum wage of Mex$57.46 (about 3 US dollars, as of September 2016). Companies that have set up maquiladoras in Tijuana include Lanix, Hyundai, Sony, Vortec, BMW, Vizio, Toyota, Dell, Samsung, Kodak, Matsushita/Panasonic, GE, Nabisco, Ford, Microsoft, Cemex, Zonda, Philips, Pioneer, Airbus, Plantronics, Siemens Mexico, Jaguar, Pall Medical, Tara, Sanyo and Volkswagen. Many of the maquiladoras are located in the Otay Mesa and Florido sections of Tijuana.\nEconomic development has its central business district at Zona R\u00edo, which together, with the corridor along Blvd. Agua Caliente (the extension of Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n), contains the majority of the higher-end office space in the city.\n\n\n=== Tourist economy and entertainment ===\nTijuana also relies on tourism for a major part of its revenue. About 300,000 visitors cross by foot or car from the San Ysidro point of entry in the United States every day. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs, and shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are part of the draw for the city's tourists, many located within walking distance of the border. The city's tourist centers include Downtown Tijuana including the nightlife hot spots around La Sexta, Avenida Revolucion, souvenir shopping at the Mercado de Artesan\u00edas and Plaza Viva Tijuana, Tijuana's Cultural Center (CECUT) and neighboring Plaza R\u00edo Tijuana shopping center, and the city's best known vices, in the form of its legal Red Light District and gambling (Agua Caliente). Mexico's drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college aged Southern Californians who tend to stay on Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n.\nTijuana is also known for its red-light district Zona Norte (also referred to as La Coahuila after one of its main streets) with legal prostitution in strip clubs and on the street. The strip clubs are typically full-contact, meaning the dancers let patrons fondle them. Many dancers also sell their sexual services. In a 1999 estimation, there were 15,000 women engaged in prostitution in Tijuana outside of clubs and brothels.Tijuana has many pharmacies that target visitors from the United States, which sell some medicines without prescriptions and/or at much lower costs than in the U.S. Many medications still require a Mexican prescription, which can be obtained from adjacent doctors' offices. People filling up prescriptions for drugs classified in the US as Schedule II or Schedule III have found it more difficult to locate such medications, and the purchase of pseudoephedrine also has become restricted by Tijuana pharmacies, just as in the U.S. To fill a prescription in Tijuana for any drug covered by the US Controlled Substances Act  and legally bring it into the United States requires a prescription from the United States for re-import.  Americans can import up to a 90-day supply of non-controlled medications for personal use to the USA from Mexico and other countries.\nBusinesses such as auto detailing, medical and dental services and plastic surgery are heavily marketed, and are usually much less expensive than in the U.S.\nTijuana is headquarters for Mexico's largest gambling concern, Grupo Caliente, which operates the only casinos in the city, more than twenty branches.Tourists are sometimes robbed by municipal police.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nPlaza Rio Tijuana is a large regional mall anchored by Cin\u00e9polis, Sanborns, S\u00faper DAX and Sears.\nAll across the city, there are dozens of plazas comerciales, which may be strip malls or small enclosed or open-air centers, with a combination of any or all of the following anchors:\n\none of the 26 Tijuana branches of the small department store Coppel,\na supermarket or hypermarket,\na cin\u00e9polis or cinemex multicinema,\na branch of the electronics and motorcycle retailer ElektraAn important concentration of plazas is in the Cinco y Diez around an eponymous intersection, named for a former American-style five and dime store that was located there. It is also a major hub for public transit. Plaza Carrousel, with its namesake merry-go-round, is located here.\nCostco, Sam's Club, and Walmart each have multiple branches across the city.\nTraditional markets with vendors include the large Mercado Hidalgo in Zona R\u00edo, smaller neighborhood markets and the Mercado Municipal downtown.\nTijuana was the headquarters of 14-store Dorian's department store chain until its demise in 2009; most were converted to Sears stores.\n\n\n=== Culinary ===\nTijuana, along with the nearby Valle de Guadalupe, has recently become a culinary hotspot due to its Baja Med cuisine, including chefs such as Javier Plascencia, but also for its tacos, other street food, food trucks, coffee houses and artisanal beer.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTijuana is home to many private Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and High Schools as well as nationally high ranked colleges and universities. Notable primary and secondary schools include Metropolitan, Instituto M\u00e9xico, Instituto Cumbres, President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas School, Agua Caliente School Center High, Polit\u00e9cnico de Baja California(CLUB DE QU\u00cdMICA), Jos\u00e9 Fimbres Moreno School and the State High School, and Ignacio Ram\u00edrez School located in Cerro Colorado. These schools maintain recognition for their demands and high standards.\nTijuana maintains multiple higher education institutions. These include the Autonomous University of Baja California, Tijuana (UABC), Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Tijuana (ITT), Universidad Iberoamericana (UIA-Tijuana), CETYS Universidad, Universidad Xochicalco, and University of the Californias. Other colleges include Tijuana University Center, Tijuana University of Technology, Graduate Center of the Northwest, and the University of Professional Development. The city is the seat of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), an institution of scientific research and higher education, specializing in the study of the problems in the border region between Mexico and the United States. In August 2009, Metropolitan UABC opened in Valle de Las Palmas, in the Tijuana metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Culture and contemporary life ==\nMany foreigners travel to Tijuana to drink and dance, buy prescription drugs, purchase bootleg brand-name clothing, timepieces, and other personal accessories found globally, as well as manufactured and hand-crafted local curiosities. Locals and regular tourists avoid hassles by visiting the clubs at Plaza Fiesta or other areas of the Zona R\u00edo without the crowds, heavy marketing, and occasional tourist misbehavior or outright lawbreaking common on the Revoluci\u00f3n strip. However, Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n has been known for its proliferation of nightclub shows, primarily catering to casual tourists. While still an entertaining town with an enjoyable atmosphere, some locals and tourists feel it has lost an \"anything goes\" atmosphere, that was dangerous to locals, tourists, and the tourism industry.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nAs Tijuana matured from a tourist-oriented border town into one of Mexico's largest cities, the 1982 opening of the Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT) marked a milestone. CECUT's mission was to strengthening Tijuana's image, both to US visitors and to Mexicans, as a destination for culture and not only shopping and vice. The center includes an OMNIMAX cinema showing IMAX films, the Museum of the Californias, contemporary art exhibition halls, a restaurant, caf\u00e9, bookstore,  and other cultural facilities.\nLa Casa de la Cultura cultural center comprises a school, a theater, and a public library, and teaches dance, painting, music, plastic arts, photography and languages.\nOther cultural venues include the Instituto Municipal de Arte y Cultura (Municipal Institute of Art and Culture), the Tijuana Wax Museum, the Museo El Trompo (Trompo Museum), and El Foro, the former Jai Alai Palace, that is now a concert venue. Concerts are also held at the Estadio Caliente stadium, Hip\u00f3dromo Agua Caliente Racetrack, and at the \"Audiorama\" at the Museo El Trompo children's museum of science and technology.The Tijuana Country Club (Club Campestre de Tijuana) has many affluent members and a famous golf course and also functions as an entertainment and events venue. Tijuana also has a large Rotary Club.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\nParque Morelos has a small zoo and park space; Parque de la Amistad in Otay Centenario has a small pond, and a running and dirt-bike track. Parque Teniente Guerrero is a downtown park with a public library and weekend entertainment by clowns.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nTijuana's nightlife scene is one of the city's strongest attractions. The area surrounding \"La Sexta\", the intersection at Calle Sexta and Av. Revoluci\u00f3n, is now a major hub of new bars and dance clubs. Zona Rio, Tijuana's new Downtown, is home to some of the city's finest restaurants and bars. Another capstone of Tijuana's entertainment offerings is its adult nightlife industry, which includes the city's red light district as well as less conspicuous adult entertainment venues.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nTijuana also has a very active and independent artist community whose internationally recognized work has earned Tijuana the title of \"one of the most important new cultural meccas\", according to Newsweek, an exhibition of Tijuana's current art scene, is being curated by the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and is traveling across the USA in 2006 and 2007. Art collectives like Bulbo and film production like Palenque Filmaciones explore the use of film like the award-winning Tijuana Makes Me Happy, media like television bulbo TV and print \"bulbo PRESS\", to show different realities of Tijuana out of Mexico. In 2004, Tijuana earned international acclaim for an art exhibition displayed on the cement banks of the Tijuana River and along the Mexico/U.S. border fence in Otay Mesa.\nGraffiti is widespread in Tijuana. They can range from free-hand writing in spray can and marker form, often carrying social or sexual commentary in English or Spanish, pictures in wheatpaste and stencils, consisting of stenciled renderings of personalities crucial to Hispanic culture from past and present eras, such as television news announcers or stars, but also extending to images of artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed. Graffiti in Tijuana may seem at first to consist largely of simplistic tags and thus not as technically evolved, colorful, or accepted in the mainstream as the \"pieces\" of graffiti scenes of the United States, Europe, or Japan, but large, colorful graffiti murals adorn walls from both native Tijuanan artists as well as visiting graffiti writers, especially from California. The Tijuanan art pieces show as much prowess and skill as those made by their more renowned U.S. counterparts, although illicit graffiti are strongly discouraged by the Tijuana government, as in other major metropolitan areas.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nSince the decade of the 1920s, Tijuana has excelled in the musical field, thanks to the first groups of ranchera music that began to set the tourist establishments in the area with the visit of foreigners, including the former Casino Agua Caliente.\nRock music was very popular and popular among young people in the mid-50s, leaving the ranch rhythm aside years ago. Another event that added the arrival of Rock to Tijuana was the visit of the African-American pianist and guitarist, Gene Ross, who came to play at the Convoy Club on Revolution Avenue. The presence of this artist was the beginning of the rock scene in the region that marked a new style in the country.54 Some groupings of the nascent Mexican rock began, an example of which was \"The Tijuana Five\", who made some covers in Spanish of Anglo-Saxon successes.\nJavier Batiz founded in 1957 he founded a group called \"Los TJ's\" with which he collected musical influences that were received in the Mexican border cities of black music, blues and R&B from people like T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin 'Wolf, James Brown, among others. Later he would start his solo career in the rest of the country and participating in some bands in Mexico City.\nDuring the 60s, the American trumpeter Herb Alpert, in a visit to the bullfights made in the old Bullfight, found musical inspiration so after the recording of his single \"The Lonely Bull\", which was a radio hit in 1962. With the success, he decided to make a casting and formed \"The Tijuana Brass\", with whom he toured and had a presentation on television. It was a musical collaboration with artists from Los Angeles, with style called \"Tijuana Marimba\u00b4s Brass\". The band was dissolved in 1969 but they continued with some presentations under the name of T.J.B. 55\nAt the end of the 60s and during the 70s, rock and roll still had great acceptance in the public. In those years bands such as \"The Moonlights\" had national and international recognition, who achieved successes such as \"Tijuana Funky\" or \"Are you\"; the \"Rockin Devils\", recognized for their Spanish cover of \"Bule Bule\", which achieved international success. The Roble Cinema, La Caba\u00f1a club and Flamingos club, would be some of the main stages of the decade for musical performances in the city.56\nIn the 70s, rock groups and musicians experienced government rejection and censorship for the lyrics of the songs. Romantic music took a boom and from there came bands like \"The Battle of Tijuana\", \"Los Solitarios\", \"Los Terr\u00edcolas\", \"Old Memories\", \"Tito Pantoja and his friends\", \"Ritmo 7\", \"Los Old Friends \",\" California Brass \"and \"Los Corazones Solitarios\", among others.\nIn the late 80s, Antonio De Carlo, was recognized as a revelation artist at the OTI Festival, having a successful career during the 90s, with songs such as \"In A Thousand Pieces\", \"A Pecho Discovery\", \"Revolution\" and \"Like It Hurts \". Lynda also gained national relevance in pop, achieving hits in songs like \"Lost Heart\", \"Tell\", \"A Thousand for an Hour\", among others.\nDespite the downturn in rock artists for some years, in the 90s Tijuana No! emerged, returning a bit of the genre to the city. They also incorporated ska, punk and reggae. \"No\" would be the first album released, from which successes like \"Pobre de ti\", which had Julieta Venegas as a vocalist, would emerge. Later the singer began her solo career already in the 00s of the 21st century. Her musical career reached the recording of six studio albums, and she won two Grammys, six Latin Grammys, six MTV Latin America and two Latin Music Billboard.\nThe city continued to be a hotbed of important rock bands, among them, especially at the international level, Specimen, other bands and prominent artists could be Ohtli, Nona Delichas, Canseco, Sonoro 2 and Headlongs. Electronic music boomed in the 90s, Murcof and the Nortec Collective, entered the scene and began to gain worldwide recognition for merging electronic music with northern and band music. This group was enriched with the visual contribution of designers and videographers who, under the same concept, provided images to this musical proposal.\nRegarding Mexican regional music, some groups of the northern genre were emerging, highlighting Los Tucanes de Tijuana, who since the 80s began their musical career until popularizing songs such as \"La Chona\", \"El Tucanazo\", \"La Chica Sexy\", among others. The Agua Caliente Band, Explosi\u00f3n Norte\u00f1a, among others, would be a new generation of Mexican popular music artists.\nAmong other things, Tijuana has been the inspiration for the birthplace of Nortec music style and Ruidoson, resulting in a very large and active electronic music scene where groups and artists like Los Macuanos, Maria y Jose, Siberium, Hidhawk and Harpocrates emerged. Tijuana also enjoys a large base of support in many other musical scenes such as mexican hip hop, reggae, hardcore, punk, black metal and house music. Famous musicians are from Tijuana including the pop-rock singer-songwriter Lynda Thomas and Vanessa Zamora and international indie punk bands like Delux and Los Kung-Fu Monkeys.\nTo promote the cultural development in children and youth of Tijuana, since 1996 the Tijuana Youth Symphony (SJT) has been promoted, which promotes education and musical training through instrument practices, music reading and public concerts. In addition, Tijuana has an opera season. There are also several musical festivals throughout the year, among which the Latin American Guitar Festival, Mainly Mozart Binacional, and the International Exhibition of contemporary dance \"Bodies in Transit\" stand out.\nTijuana is home to the Baja California Orchestra, one of the most prestigious and solid artistic institutions in northwestern Mexico, which was nominated for the Latin Grammy in the category of best classical album by the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Inc ., with the album Tango kills Danz\u00f3n kills Tango. This phonogram was distinguished as 'Best Classical Album of the year 2001' by the Mexican Union of Theater and Music Chroniclers. Currently, it maintains an annual season, offering symphonic and chamber music concerts in the most important forums of Tijuana and Baja California.\nAlready in the new century, many local bands have emerged, from all musical genres, some of them staying with local and national recognition. Highlights Nosis, High Slogan, Go Future, Ramona, The Children of the Saint, Among Deserts, Ziruela, Palos Verdes, Edwin, among others. Each of them have contributed and tried to revive the musical talent for which Tijuana has always been characterized.\nMusical clubs along the Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n area and others often cater to a diverse range of tastes by offering nightly variations on musical fare, such as new wave music one night, and punk rock bands on the next. Some European metal bands whose members cannot perform in the United States due to prior felony convictions in their own countries play music festivals in Tijuana for fans from both Mexico and the United States.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city is home to the Tijuana Zonkeys professional basketball team of the CIBACOPA basketball league. The team is composed mostly of players from Mexico and plays from February to July in the Municipal Auditorium.\nThe city has a strong tradition of association football, Club Tijuana began playing in the Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n on the 2011/12 season, winning the 2012 Apertura title. They play their matches at the Estadio Caliente, a new 33,000 seat stadium. The team's mascot is the Xoloitzcuintle, a famous Mexican hairless dog.\nTijuana also has a long history of producing many world champion professional boxers, such as Antonio Margarito and Erik Morales.\n\n\n=== Stadiums ===\nEstadio Caliente\n\nThe stadium is the Estadio Caliente, match venue for Club Tijuana, a Liga MX M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n football team. It is located in the Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Baja California (Mexico). Caliente Homes Stadium, is a multi-purpose center in Tijuana. It is mainly used for football matches, has a seating capacity of 21,000 spectators.  Opened in June 2008, according to the work schedule. It was a significant reason for Tijuana Club was promoted to the M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n; FEMEXFUT requires participating teams should have a stadium with a seating capacity of over 15,000. It is at this stage the U-17 FIBA Americas Championship 2009 was held bound for Nigeria. Was introduced in M\u00e9xico Primera Divisi\u00f3n during the Apertura 2011 tournament of the Mexican Football Federation.Estadio Chevron\n\nThe Chevron Stadium  is the home of the Toros de Tijuana. It opened in 1977 and housed the Colts missing Tijuana Mexican Pacific League. Subsequently, the stadium was used for football matches. For 2004, professional baseball returned, now with a franchise LMB under the name of Toros de Tijuana, which, the following year, changed its name to Colts as it had been known previously. At first the facility was called Cerro Colorado Stadium, due to its location at the foot of the hill of that name. With the return of baseball, chain supermarkets Calimax bought the naming rights to the stadium.  In 2004, the first season of Toros, the fans filled the stadium for most matches.  On April 4, 2013, the stadium was remodeled, marking the beginning of a new era for Toros de Tijuana.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\n\n\n==== Water ====\nThe Tijuana State Commission of Public Services (CESPT) supplies the city with its water, while the city receives its electricity from La Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE).\nIn 2019, due to extremely low water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir, CESPT began a city-wide water rationing scheme. This rationing scheme would divide Tijuana and nearby Rosarito into 5 zones. Each zone would be cut-off from the water supply on a rotating schedule of 4 days with water and 1 day without water. This scheme was expected to last for at least 2 months until the water levels at El Carrizo Reservoir were improved.\n\n\n==== Wastewater ====\nThe International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) developed, as a joint project of the USA and Mexico in the mid-1980s following substantial environmental studies, treats 25 million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Tijuana River; directly pumped across the border from the central collection point in Mexico. When the river is flowing, the diversion system of the plant begins operating and diverts up to about 12-13mgd to the IWTP. The total amount of water being diverted must not exceed 25 mgd, based on a monthly average decided upon by permit conditions, although the IWTP can treat sustained flows up to 45mgd daily and peaks of 70mgd for a short period. The diversion system regularly sends approximately six to eight million gallons of water daily to the IWTP. The plant is currently being upgraded to include a secondary treatment facility.\nThe city also four to five decentralize units that are part of the Tijuana/Rosarito Potable Water and Wastewater Master Plan. This plan was required as part of Public Law 106-457, put into order November 7, 2000, which was written to allow the Bajagua project to move forward. The master plan was a binational collaborative effort by EPA and CESPT and addressed San Diego-Tijuana's needs for the next 20 years. The plants are intended to treat approximately 5mgd each, to tertiary levels and provide the reclaimed water to the surrounding areas for agriculture, industry etc. There are several issues that they are facing: no infrastructure to convey the reclaimed water to customers and inadequate groundwater recharge infrastructure.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications ====\nTijuana's telephonic system operates under area code 664, but it is not the same area code 664 that is part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) because Mexico is not one of the countries represented in the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) where the country code is 1. So, to dial a phone number from San Diego to Tijuana requires an international access code and Mexico's Country Code, 52, before dialing the area code and the number.  It is similar for anyone calling from Tijuana to the United States.\nTelephonic landlines in Tijuana are provided by the company Telnor; other companies include Axtel, Izzi Telecom and Alestra. Popular cell phone carriers in the city-region include Movistar, Telcel, and AT&T Mexico. Many U.S. carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile offer free roaming in Mexico and it is possible to connect to U.S. based cell phone towers in many northern parts of the city. Cell phones also have historic usage in Tijuana as the first cellular call in Mexico was made in Tijuana in 1989.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nTijuana is a major gateway to the interior of Mexico to which it is connected by air and road directly, and by sea via the ports of Ensenada and San Diego. Within Tijuana there are freeways and other roads, and buses, but no passenger rail.\nLocal public transportation in Tijuana is run by semiprivate companies, and has one of the most complex, or perhaps unorganized networks.\n\n\n==== Air ====\nThe Tijuana International Airport (General Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez IA) is the city's main airport, one of the busiest in Mexico, and serves eleven airlines with destinations across Mexico and Shanghai, China. Tijuana Airport is also a second main airport for the San Diego area for passengers heading south into Mexico and Latin America, who may use the airport's Cross Border Xpress terminal located on the U.S. side of the border in Otay Mesa and connected to the rest of the airport on the Mexican side by a pedestrian toll bridge. U.S. and Canadian destinations can be reached via the San Diego International Airport, located about 35 kilometers (22 mi) north of the international border.\n\n\n==== Road ====\nTwo important Mexican federal highway corridors start in Tijuana, one of them is Fed 1, which runs south through the Baja California Peninsula through Rosarito Beach, Baja Mar, and Ensenada before ending in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. From Tijuana to Ensenada, most travelers take Fed 1D (scenic road), a four-lane, limited access toll road that runs by the coast starting at Playas de Tijuana. Fed 2 runs east for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) near the international border, as far as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua.\nWithin the metropolitan area the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 freeway connecte Mesa de Otay in the northeast of the city with Rosarito Beach in the southwest.\nJust north of the San Ysidro border crossing, Interstate 5 and Interstate 805 head northbound to San Diego and beyond. From the Otay Mesa border crossing, Interstate 905 takes drivers west to connect with both I-805 and I-5.\n\n\n==== Intercity buses ====\nThe city's main bus station is in its eastern borough. A small terminal downtown serves a few Mexican bus lines, and U.S.-based Greyhound Lines and Crucero USA. Another bus station near the border provides frequent service to Ensenada, and other major cities\u2014including Mazatl\u00e1n, Culiac\u00e1n, Hermosillo, and Guadalajara. Major bus lines operating in Tijuana include Azul y Blanco de Magallanes (Blue & White) and Transporte Efectivo Express de Tijuana \u2013 TEEXTI; modernizing system originally intended to phase out the other lines that partially introduced but ceased and merged with Azul y Blanco.\n\n\n==== Local buses ====\nIn 2006, Tijuana underwent a major overhaul of its existing system of guayines, or shared fixed-route station wagons, forcing the replacement of the guayines with new models of vans, serving as fixed-route taxis. Major transit hubs include Centro (Downtown Tijuana), Otay, Soler, and the Cinco y Diez avenues. Taxi lines operating in the city include Free Taxis, those that do not maintain a specific route; Economic Taxis; Diamond Taxis \u2013 black or yellow cabs; and regular taxis maintaining a set route. There are as many bus lines and routes as fixed-route taxi ones or calafias, and new routes for buses, taxis or calafias are frequently created, due to high demand of public transportation. Public transportation service is inexpensive, with bus tickets at maximum, USD $0.75. Fixed-route taxis are somewhat more expensive, depending on the taxi route, reaching USD $2.00. Bus, taxi and calafia lines and routes are distinguished from one another by their vehicles colors.\n\n\n==== Bus rapid transit ====\n\nA bus rapid transit system SITT operates one route from Downtown Tijuana and Garita Puerto Mexico near the San Ysidro Port of Entry, southeasterly along the Tijuana River to Terminal Insurgentes in the southeast of the city. It is part of a planned system of main and feeder lines to replace other buses and minibuses.\n\n\n==== Light rail ====\nPreviously there have been plans for a light rail service, for example in January 2009, the City Council and the Ministry of Communications and Transportation announced such a system along the Tijuana River, however so far nothing has come of these plans.There is, however, a light rail connection to downtown San Diego and beyond, starting immediately north of the San Ysidro Port of Entry to the U.S. at the San Ysidro Transit Center, where municipal buses also operate.\n\n\n==== Ride share ====\nRide share services Uber and DiDi operate throughout Tijuana and surrounding cities.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nTijuana has multiple sister cities and twin towns. These relations have been formalized by a variety of organizations as well as municipal governments. Currently twinned with the City of Tijuana are:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n Mexico portal\nTijuana Cartel\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nKun, Josh, and Fiamma Montezemolo, eds.

Restaurateur Caesar Cardini, an Italian immigrant, opened the restaurant in 1923, and it is now under chef Javier Plascencia, leading chef of Baja Med cuisine.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original Caesar's bar and restaurant was first opened in an alley in 1923, and its salad became famous after its reported invention on July 4th of the following year. Julia Child said that she visited the restaurant during her youth in 1925 or 1926.In 1926 it moved to 2nd Street, and a year later it moved to its current location at the Hotel Caesar's on Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n Street between 4th and 5th streets. Cardini bought the hotel and restaurant in 1932.Following a huge reduction in U.S. visitors to Tijuana after 9/11 and subsequent long border wait times to return to the U.S., the restaurant closed in 2009, due to debt. Javier's Father Juan Jos\u00e9 Plascencia renovated the restaurant and reopened it in July, 2010, with a luxurious art deco interior reminiscent of the 1920s. In 2017, the San Diego Reader called it the \"classiest joint in Tijuana\". Waiters prepare the \"original\" Caesar salads tableside.Armenui Avakian, is the current owner of the restaurant and hotel, which was featured by Andrew Zimmern in his Travel Channel television special The Border Check.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Golden Baseball League, based in San Ramon, California, was an independent baseball league. It later merged with the Northern League and the United Baseball League to form the North American League in the western United States, western Canada and Mexico.\nThe GBL was not affiliated with Major League Baseball or the organized Minor League Baseball system, but has featured players with MLB experience (Rickey Henderson, Jose Canseco, Alex Arias, Bud Smith, Desi Wilson, Jos\u00e9 Lima, Hideki Irabu, Junior Spivey, Mark Prior). It was formed in 2004 and began play on May 26, 2005.\nOver 100 players were sold to MLB organizations since it began play, with seven players already making it to a major league uniform \u2013 Dane De La Rosa, Adam Pettyjohn, Scott Richmond, Chris Jakubauskas, Sergio Romo, Bobby Cramer, and Daniel Nava.\nThe GBL's presenting partner was Safeway Inc.  Other investors in the GBL  included Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak, former National Football League players Mike Sherrard and Christian Okoye, and executives from Cisco Systems, Taleo and Draper Fisher Jurvetson.The Golden Baseball League combined with United League Baseball and the Northern League into a new North American League for the 2011 season to form the first nationwide independent professional baseball league. However, the North American League folded after two seasons.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe league was founded in 2004 by Stanford University graduates Dave Kaval and Amit Patel. Kaval was the president and chief executive officer (Patel departed after the 2008 season to run his family business conglomerate in Laurel, Mississippi). Brian MacInnes was the president, and Bill Weiss was the league's secretary and historian.Many former MLB coaches and players coached or managed in the GBL, including Kip Gross, Les Lancaster, Mike Marshall, Ozzie Virgil, Jr., Darrell Evans, Garry Templeton, Cory Snyder, Jeffrey Leonard, Gary Carter, Mike Busch, Steve Yeager, Phil Nevin, Charlie Hough, Mark Parent, Tim Johnson, Terry Kennedy, Paul Abbott, Brett Boone, Alex Arias, Rusty Meacham, and Warren Cromartie.\n\n\n=== The beginning ===\nThe league began with a single-entity model whereby the league owned all the clubs (except Tijuana and Japan which were partnerships). Since then, several of the clubs have been sold to private groups.\nIn its inaugural season, the league was composed of eight teams: the Chico Outlaws, Fullerton Flyers, Long Beach Armada and San Diego Surf Dawgs in California; Mesa Miners, Surprise Fightin' Falcons and Yuma Scorpions in Arizona and the Japan Samurai Bears. All teams played their home games in city- and university-owned stadiums, with the exception of the Samurai Bears, a traveling team of Japanese players that played all of its games on the road. The Japanese team was a late entry as the Tijuana Toros, who led all of minor league baseball in attendance at over 13,000 fans a game, had jumped from the Mexican League to the GBL in December to be a charter member of the league, only to learn that the government of the Mexican state of Baja California would not permit this.\nThree of the GBL's teams, Long Beach, Chico and Yuma, operated in cities that once hosted Western Baseball League teams. The WBL operated from 1995 to 2002.\nOn May 9, 2005, Major League Baseball's all-time stolen base leader, Rickey Henderson, signed a contract to play the 2005 season with the Surf Dawgs.\nThe 2005 season ended with a four-team championship tournament on Labor Day Weekend. The tournament ended with San Diego winning two games on the final day, knocking off Mesa in the second game to win the title.\nJos\u00e9 Canseco, another retired star, signed with the Surf Dawgs in 2006 as part of his attempt to return to baseball and promote his book, Juiced, along with its upcoming movie adaptation. Canseco was traded to the Armada after only one game. He said that the move was to be closer to his daughter.\n\n\n=== Season 2: League Contracts ===\nBefore the 2006 season, Surprise was discontinued, while Mesa moved to Reno, another former Western League city, and became the Reno Silver Sox, the first GBL club in Nevada. The league moved to a six-team format and did not have the traveling Samurai Bears return.\n\n\n=== League expands to Utah and Canada ===\nPrior to the 2007 season, the San Diego Surf Dawgs operation was discontinued as San Diego State breached the lease agreement with the league and subsequently paid a settlement. The GBL remained at six teams by adding the St. George RoadRunners. The Utah city also hosted a Western League club from 1999 to 2001, the Zion Pioneerzz, becoming the fifth former WBL city to join the league.\nIn 2008, two former Northern League clubs, the Calgary Vipers and Edmonton Cracker-Cats, joined the GBL, becoming the loop's first two Canadian teams.\nThe league expanded to nine teams in 2009 with the addition of the Victoria Seals, while the Reno Silver Sox moved to Tucson to become the Toros. The Cracker-Cats were sold to Edmonton Oilers owner Daryl Katz and renamed the Edmonton Capitals for the 2009 season.\n\n\n=== Tijuana joins league in 2009 and will play in 2010 ===\nOn December 15, 2008, the league signed a letter of intent to place another expansion franchise in Tijuana, Mexico. After the addition of the expansion Tijuana Potros on January 13, the Armada were moved to the North Division. The Potros themselves would postpone the season due to the swine flu outbreak in Mexico.  This made all their scheduled games days off for the other nine teams and left their GBL future in serious doubt.\nAs planned, the Tijuana team did return for the 2010 season but came back with a new name and additional owners. The Tijuana Cimarrones were announced as a member of the GBL when the schedule was released on January 15, 2010.\n\n\n=== Yuma becomes a Colombian affiliation in 2009 ===\nOn May 20, 2009, the Yuma Sun reported that the team had signed an affiliation agreement with the Colombian Professional Baseball League (CPBL).  Under the terms of the affiliation, the CPBL will handle all on-field personnel and player issues while the team will retain control of promotions, concessions, and other front-office business. The Scorpions will act as a showcase team for players from all four CPBL teams.Yuma Scorpion Reynaldo Rodriguez, of Cartagena, Colombia, was named GBL 2009 Rookie of the Year, the top prospect in all the independent leagues by Baseball America, and had his contract purchased by the Boston Red Sox.\n\n\n=== Maui announced for 2010, Long Beach suspended ===\nOn September 30, 2009, the GBL announced that the Hawaiian sports and entertainment company XnE Inc. had purchased the territory rights to place teams in Hawaii and that their inaugural team would play at the War Memorial Complex in Maui in 2010. The team announced their name as Na Koa Ikaika Maui, which means the Strong Warriors of Maui.The Long Beach Armada announced that they were suspending operations due to an ongoing stadium lease dispute with the city of Long Beach.\n\n\n=== Kaval leaves GBL for MLS, League to expand east ===\nDave Kaval, co-founder and C.E.O. of the GBL since its inception in 2005, resigned to take the job as team president of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer.The United League and the Northern League agreed to join the GBL for the 2011 season in the formation of the new North American League. The Rockford RiverHawks, Schaumburg Flyers, Joliet Jackhammers, and Lake County Fielders planned on leaving the Northern League and join the GBL for 2011 with the new format.  United League teams joining the NAL include the Edinburg Roadrunners, Harlingen Whitewings and San Angelo Colts.\n\n\n== Drug testing ==\nThe league was the only independent baseball association to have drug testing. The league CEO Dave Kaval explained:\n\"I feel that there is no place for illegal drugs in our business. We run a family-friendly operation off the field, and illegal drug usage by our players would undermine the trust we have established with our fans. That is exactly what has happened at the MLB level. As a steward of the great game of baseball, I am proud to say that we have the most stringent drug policy in all of professional baseball.\"\n\n\n== Franchises that played ==\n\n\n=== Teams that never played ===\nTijuana Toros from Tijuana, Mexico \u2013 Stadium was seized by Mexican military forces in January 2005 and awarded to former politicians who had struck a deal to bring a team back to the Mexican Summer League. The GBL quickly responded by forming the Japan Samurai Bears to fill the Tijuana spot on the schedule. There was also the Tijuana Potros and Tijuana Embajadores from Tijuana, Baja California.\nSanta Clarita, California \u2013 Awarded franchise in 2006, but ownership was unable to find or build a ballpark.\nPalm Springs, California - Awarded franchise in 2009, was expected to play in the 2012 season. The GBL and later NAL didn't allow Palm Springs to have the team play in 2010 and 2011, due to Palm Springs Stadium's substandard facility standards.\n\n\n== Season-by-season results ==\n\n\n=== 2005 Season ===\nStandingsx-Division Champion y-Wild Card (Division champions and top two wild card teams go to Championship.)\n\nPlayoffs and Championship (4 team double-elimination, final 2 teams face in one game playoff):Awards:Gold Glove winners:\nPitcher: Adam Pettyjohn, Long Beach\nCatcher: Cody Clark, San Diego\nFirst base: Yuji Nerei, Samurai Bears\nSecond base: Kenichi Miura, Samurai Bears\nThird base: Sean Walsh, Fullerton\nShortstop: Jeremy Hernandez, Long Beach\nOutfielders Marcus Knight, Mesa; Billy Brown, Surprise; Travis McAndrews, Long Beach\n\n\n=== 2006 season ===\nStandings:z-First-half champion and best overall record, x-second-half champion (Champions of each half face in 5-game series for championship.

The 2008 game was hosted by the ULB's San Angelo Colts, while the 2009 game was to be hosted by the Orange County Flyers.With the bankruptcy of the United League in the off-season after 2008 and the ensuing new ownership of the ULB not honoring the agreement to send a team to play the GBL in the 2009 All-Star game, the second half of this agreement was canceled.\n\n\n=== 2009 GBL All-Star Game ===\nThe GBL held its own All-Star Game, North vs. South, in St. George, Utah - home of the RoadRunners on Tuesday, July 14.

These leagues folded with the NAL in 2013.\n\n\n=== Arizona Winter League ===\n\nOn November 15, 2006, the Golden Baseball League announced the Arizona Winter League, which would be a short-season instructional league for its summer league.

Two of those players, Scott Richmond and Sergio Romo, are now pitching in the major leagues. The 2009 Arizona Winter League began play on January 31, 2009 and has expanded to 8 teams and almost 200 players.\n\n\n=== Arizona Summer League ===\n\nOn April 3, 2009, the Golden Baseball League announced its second instructional league known as the Arizona Summer League, which is patterned after the AWL.

From Ave. Revolucion near the Jai Ali building an Uber to the stadium cost about $12usd. Traffic getting to the stadium before a game is bad. If",
          "This was our first time going to see the Toros play at Estadio gasmart. The Toros are a AAA level baseball team so the product on the field is pretty good. Now for the rest of the visit. People were tailgating in the parking lot before the game and there was also a parking",
          "My church had an event here at the Estadio Gasmart. It is a great stadium, it doesn't seat a lot like an MLB stadium, but it is perfect for the area!",
          "The Tijuana Toros are the local Mexican major league team with a quality of play that is probably the equivalent to double-A ball in the United States. What makes the experience here different is that the star attraction for the fans is not what happens during the game, but",
          "This stadium is a Baseball stadium. It is simple and it has the problem of having minimal access. It is a pain to get in with your vehicle and will take forever to get out for a concert. They also did not have the access marked for VIP to get in the shorter lines. Security",
          "Saw the Tijuana Toros on a lark. What a great experience ! The game is a huge party. Roving mariachi music, all sections food service, amazing variety, huge beers for $3, no 7th inning cut-off, very slinky cheerleaders, 3 amusing mascots, good Latin music, AAA level baseball,"

        "wiki": "Sochi (Russian: \u0421\u043e\u0301\u0447\u0438, IPA: [\u02c8sot\u0255\u026a] (listen)) is a city in Krasnodar Krai. It is located in Western Russia, on the Black Sea coast near Russia's southern border. The Greater Sochi area, which includes territories and localities subordinated to Sochi proper, has a total area of 3,526 square kilometers (1,361 sq mi) and sprawls for 145 kilometers (90 mi) along the shores of the Black Sea near the Caucasus Mountains. The area of the city proper is 176.77 square kilometers (68.25 sq mi). According to the 2010 Census, the city had a permanent population of 343,334, up from 328,809 recorded in the 2002 Census, making it Russia's largest resort city. Being part of the Caucasian Riviera, it is one of the very few places in Russia with a subtropical climate, with warm to hot summers and mild winters.\nWith the alpine and Nordic events held at the nearby ski resort of Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi hosted the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, as well as the Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix from 2014 until at least 2020. It was also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore the whole area was conquered by Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian invaders, the Zygii people lived in Lesser Abkhazia under the Kingdom of Pontus, then the Roman Empire's influence in antiquity. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of Lazica and Abkhazia, who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was unified under the single Georgian monarchy in 11th-century, forming one of the Saeristavo, known as Tskhumi extending its possessions up to Nicopsis. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading Alans, Khazars, Mongols and other nomadic empires whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century Byzantine basilica still stands in the Loo Microdistrict.From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi known as Ubykhia was part of historical Circassia, and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, which was their principal trading partner in the Muslim world.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nThe coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Caucasian War and the Russo-Turkish War, 1828\u20131829; however, the Circassians did not admit the Russian control over Circassia and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the Circassian coast (Adyghe: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044b \u0430\u0443\u0448\u0443). Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the Russian Empire and the British Empire that occurred in 1836 over the mission of the Vixen.The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron Feodor Tornau investigated the coastal route from Gelendzhik to Gagra, and across the mountains to Kabarda, in the 1830s. In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the Sochi River as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky in order to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on Cape Adler soon after.\nThe last battle of the Caucasian War took place at the Godlikh river on March 18, 1864 O.S., where the Ubykhs were defeated by the Dakhovsky regiment of the Russian Army. On March 25, 1864, the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of Caucasian War was proclaimed at Kbaade tract (modern Krasnaya Polyana) on June 2 (21 May O.S.), 1864, by the manifesto of Emperor Alexander II read aloud by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia.After the end of Caucasian War (during the period of 1864\u20131870) almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the Shapsugs, who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed in the Circassian Genocide or expelled to the Ottoman Empire (see Circassian Genocide). Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia.In 1874\u20131891, the first Russian Orthodox church, St. Michael's Church, was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed Dakhovsky Posad on April 13, 1874 (O.S.). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky Posad was renamed Sochi Posad (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed Black Sea Governorate. In 1900\u20131910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, \"Kavkazskaya Riviera\", opened on June 14, 1909 (O.S.). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Soviet time ===\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the littoral area saw sporadic armed clashes involving the Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev's Constructivist Institute of Rheumatology (1927\u20131931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Modern Russia ===\nFollowing Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimean Peninsula (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a Greater Sochi which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGreater Sochi is elongated along the Black Sea coast for 145 kilometers (90 mi). Sochi is approximately 1,603 kilometers (996 mi) from Moscow.The city of Sochi borders with Tuapsinsky District in the northwest, with Apsheronsky District and with Maykopsky District of the Republic of Adygea in the north, with Mostovsky District in the northeast, and with Georgia/Abkhazia in the southeast. From the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea.\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are Lazarevskoye, Loo, Dagomys, central Sochi (Tsentralny City District), Khosta, Matsesta, and Adler. The whole city is located on the slopes of the Western Caucasus which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the Mzymta, which is in fact the longest Black Sea tributary in Russia, and the Shakhe. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the Sochi, the Khosta, and the Matsesta. The Psou River makes the border with Abkhazia.\nThe northeastern part of the city belongs to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve which is a World Heritage Site spanning vast areas in Krasnodar Krai and Adygea. Almost the whole area of the Greater Sochi, with the exception of the coast and of the area which belong to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, are included into Sochi National Park.\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters (average 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from December to March and warm summers (average 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) during the day and 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from May to October.\n\n\n=== Layout and landmarks ===\nSochi is unique among larger Russian cities as having some aspects of a subtropical resort. Apart from the scenic Caucasus Mountains, pebble and sand beaches, the city attracts vacation-goers with its subtropical vegetation, numerous parks, monuments, and extravagant Stalinist architecture. About two million people visit Greater Sochi each summer, when the city is home to the annual film festival \"Kinotavr\" and a getaway for Russia's elite.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 2,957 square kilometers (731,000 acres) Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, lies just north from the city. Sochi also has the region's most northerly tea plantations.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), at the lower elevations. Its average annual temperature is 18.4 \u00b0C (65.1 \u00b0F) during the day and 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) at night. In the coldest months\u2014January and February\u2014the average temperature is about 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) during the day, above 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). In the warmest months\u2014July and August\u2014the temperature typically ranges from 25 to 29 \u00b0C (77 to 84 \u00b0F) during the day, about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 23\u201324 \u00b0C (73\u201375 \u00b0F). Yearly sunshine hours are around 2,200. Generally, the summer season lasts four months, from June to September. Two months\u2014April and November\u2014are transitional; sometimes temperatures reach 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with an average temperature of around 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) during the day and 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at night. December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperature (of these four months) 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night. Average annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters (67 in). Sochi lies at 8b/9a hardiness zone, so the city supports different types of palm trees. Sochi is situated on the same latitude as Nice but strong cold winds from Asia make winters less warm. In fact, temperatures drop below freezing every winter. The highest temperature recorded was 39.4 \u00b0C (102.9 \u00b0F), on July 30, 2000, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221213.4 \u00b0C (7.9 \u00b0F) on January 25, 1892.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status and city divisions ==\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Krasnaya Polyana) and seventy-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Sochi\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Sochi is incorporated as Sochi Urban Okrug.Sochi is administratively subdivided into four city districts: Tsentralny City District, Lazarevsky City District, Khostinsky City District, and Adlersky City District. Tsentralny City District, comprising the central portion of, is by far the smallest out of four in terms of the area, and the other three have comparable areas, with Lazarevsky City District being the biggest. In terms of the population, Tsentralny City District is approximately twice as big as each of the other three city districts.\n\n\n=== Tsentralny City District ===\n\nTsentralny City District, or central Sochi, covers an area of 32 square kilometers (12 sq mi) and, as of the 2010 Census, has a population of 137,677. The highlights include:\n\nMichael Archangel Cathedral, a diminutive church built in 1873\u20131891 to Kaminsky's designs in order to commemorate the victorious conclusion of the Caucasian War.\nThe red-granite Archangel Column, erected in 2006 in memory of the Russian soldiers fallen in Sochi during the Caucasian War. It is capped by a 7-metre bronze statue of Sochi's patron saint, Michael the Archangel.\nSochi Art Museum occupies a large building with a four-columned portico, completed in 1939. The Neoclassical design is by Ivan Zholtovsky.\nSochi Arboretum, a large botanical garden with tropical trees from many countries, and the Mayors Alle\u00e9\u2014a landscape avenue of palm trees planted by mayors from cities around the world.\nThe Tree of Friendship, a hybrid citrus tree planted in 1934 in the Subtropical Botanic Garden. Since 1940 numerous citrus cultivars from foreign countries have been grafted onto this tree as a token of friendship and peace. The associated Friendship Tree Garden Museum has a collection of 20,000 commemorative presents from around the world.\nThe Winter Theater (1934\u20131937) is another rigorously Neoclassical edifice, surrounded by 88 Corinthian columns, with a pediment bearing the statues of Terpsichore, Melpomene and Thalia, all three cast by Vera Mukhina.\nHall of Organ and Chamber Music. Located centrally in the city of Sochi it conducts organ, symphony, chamber-ensemble, choral, vocal music concerts. All year round the Sochi Symphony Orchestra, local actors of the city art groups, famous Russian and international performers, International Contests Winners and Laureates give concerts here.\nThe Maritime Passenger Terminal (1955) is notable for its distinctive 71-meter-high steepled tower and four statues symbolizing the cardinal points.\nThe Railway Station (1952) is one of the most remarkable buildings of Sochi.\nThe Riviera Park was established by Vasily Alexeyevich Khludov in 1883 in the part of the city which later became known as Khludovskaya. The park is popular with tourists and local residents alike. It has a variety of attractions, including an outcrop of funny statues and a \"glade of friendship\" where magnolia trees were planted by every Soviet cosmonaut, among other notables.\n\n\n=== Lazarevsky City District ===\n\nLazarevsky City District lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people. It is the largest city district by area, covering some 1,744 square kilometers (673 sq mi) and comprising several microdistricts:\n\nLazarevskoye, 59 km (37 mi) from the city center, contains a delphinarium, an old church (1903), and a new church (1999). The settlement was founded as a Russian military outpost in 1839 and was named after Admiral Mikhail Lazarev.\nLoo, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, was once owned by Princes Loov, a noble Abkhazian family. The district contains the ruins of a medieval church, founded in the 8th century, rebuilt in the 11th century, and converted into a fortress in the Late Middle Ages.\nDagomys, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, has been noted for its botanical garden, established by order of Nicholas II, as well as tea plantations and factories. A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins Bocharov Ruchey, a dacha built for Kliment Voroshilov in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the President of Russia, where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.\nGolovinka is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the Ubykhs and the Shapsugs, the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the Subashi landing of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted Decembrists used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the Crimean War, so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.\nFort Godlik, of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the Khazars and revived by the Genoese in the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Khostinsky City District ===\n\nKhostinsky City District, sprawling to the southeast from the city center, occupies approximately 374 square kilometers (144 sq mi), with a population of 65,229 as of the 2010 Census. The district is traversed by many rivulets which give their names to the microdistricts of Matsesta (\"flame-colored river\"), Kudepsta, and Khosta (\"the river of boars\").\n\n\n=== Adlersky City District ===\n\nAdlersky City District, with an area of 1,352 square kilometers (522 sq mi) and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census, is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient Sadz village and a medieval Genoese trading post.\nAmong the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation from about 30,000 years ago. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages (auls), the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nAlso located here are the largest trout fishery in Russia (founded in 1964) and a breeding nursery for great apes.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%).\nThe city is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi's Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey's northeastern Black Sea coast who came in the late 19th century and on. The rest are Armenians from Georgia (particularly from Abkhazia and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Armenia (especially from Shirak Province due to the 1988 earthquake).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Sochi region in the Middle Ages. The region was relatively isolated before 1829. In the North, a few hundred Sunni Muslim Shapsugs, a part of the Circassian nation, lived around Tkhagapsh, near Lazarevskoye. The Circassians (also known as Adyghe) converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread to the region.Currently, Sochi is a large predominantly Christian city, though there are thought to be around 20,000 Muslims (5% of inhabitants) living there now (the majority are Adyghe) plus other Eastern Caucasians, Turks, Tatars, and other smaller Muslim groups.A mosque was built in 2008 by United Arab Emirates in the central area of Bytkha, in addition to the old mosque being around 40 km (25 miles) north of the city center in the Adyghe aul of Tkhagapsh.\nThere are around thirty Russian Orthodox churches, the largest being St. Michael's, and two monasteries, plus two Catholic churches, one in the center of Sochi and the other in Lazarevskoye. The Armenian community, which is important in Sochi, gathers in about ten churches.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSochi is home to the following high educational institutions (masters level degree and PhD):  Sochi State University, Russian International Innovative University, and Russian International Olympic University.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\nSochi is also known for its sport facilities: a local tennis school spawned the careers of such notable players as Grand Slam champions Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Kafelnikov spent much of his childhood here, while Sharapova relocated to Florida at the age of seven). In late 2005, the Russian Football Union announced that it was planning to establish a year-round training center for the country's national teams in Sochi. The city's warm climate was cited as one of the main incentives. Sochi is also the home for the football team PFC Sochi which plays in the Russian Premier League and for the ice hockey team HC Sochi which plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\n\n=== 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===\n\nThe nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor at Krasnaya Polyana was the location of the alpine and Nordic events for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nIn June 2006, the International Olympic Committee announced that Sochi had been selected as a finalist city to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On July 4, 2007, Sochi was announced as the host city of the 2014 Winter Games, edging out Pyeongchang, South Korea and Salzburg, Austria.This was Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The site of a training centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi saw concern and controversy following a new federal law approved in Russia in June 2013 that bans \"homosexual propaganda to minors\". There were also concerns over Islamist militants.\n\n\n==== Construction work ====\n\nThe state-controlled RAO UES announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30 billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014. The power generating companies Inter RAO UES and RusHydro would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants\u2014and the federal grid company FGC UES has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW\u2014of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. \"The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6 billion rubles (about US $3.26 billion), of which 50 billion rubles (about US$2 billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid,\" the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8 billion rubles (about US$1.9 billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38 billion roubles (about US$1.48 billion) of that.\n\n\n=== Other sports events ===\n\nThe Silk Way Rally which is part of Dakar series took place in Sochi in 2010 for the last stage between the capital of the Republic of Adygea Maykop to the city of Sochi through Pseshwap.President Vladimir Putin reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone for the city to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix from 2014.The World Robot Olympiad took place in the Adler Arena Skating Center on November 21\u201323, 2014.\nThe 2014 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen was played in Sochi in November 2014, with Carlsen emerging as the winner.\nThe Fisht Olympic Stadium was also used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches.\nSince 2014, the city has hosted HC Sochi, who play at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in the Kontinental Hockey League, the biggest ice hockey league in Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nPublic transport is represented mainly by bus and taxi. Sochi is served by the Adler-Sochi International Airport. Types of non-mass public transport include two funiculars (at the Central military sanatorium and Ordzhonikidze resort) and three cable cars (at arboretum sanatorium \"Dawn\" and pension \"Neva\") also has several cableways in Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe Sochi Port terminal building was built in 1955 by Karo Alabyan and Leonid Karlik in Stalinist architecture. It is topped with a 71-meter steepled tower. Sculptures embodying seasons and cardinal points are set above the tower's three tiers.\nFive of the railway stations of Sochi were renovated for the 2014 Winter Olympics. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta and Khosta railway stations. In Adler city district of Sochi, the original railway station was preserved and new railway station was built near it.

        "wiki": "There were many controversies and concerns affecting the 2014 Winter Olympics. There were disputes with Circassians, who demanded the events be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for the 19th century Circassian genocide, environmental and economic issues, lack of political stability and governance, and the safety and human rights of LGBT athletes and journalists, in light of Russia's \"gay propaganda\" laws, which sparked Olympic-focused protests. However, all of these events were overshadowed by the massive Russian state-sponsored doping program uncovered in the aftermath of the Games.\n\n\n== Human rights ==\n\nOn 30 January 2014, nine Amnesty International European directors delivered a petition in Moscow to the offices of Russian President Vladimir Putin calling on him to repeal a series of laws restricting the right to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of association in the run up to the 2014 Winter Olympics. The organization felt that the laws were no substitute for an effective justice system, and demanded the Russian authorities to release immediately and unconditionally all prisoners of conscience (POCs). The Russian parliament passed an amnesty bill that freed the imprisoned Pussy Riot singers, the foreign activists amongst Greenpeace's \"Arctic 30\" and the 2012 Bolotnaya Square protest.Human Rights Watch has repeatedly presented the IOC detailed evidence of documented human rights abuses linked to Russia's preparations for the 2014 Winter Games since 2009. Human Rights Watch have documented exploitation of migrant workers in violation of Russian law; evictions of residents without fair compensation and in some cases, with no compensation at all. Many resettled residents lost a portion of their livelihoods; Threats, harassment, and lawsuits of activists and journalists critical of the Games, as well as Russia's discriminatory anti-LGBT propaganda law. Not before late 2013 the Russian government and IOC covered $8.34 million in wage arrears.Both German president Joachim Gauck and European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Viviane Reding publicly boycotted the Games over human rights abuses, with Reding specifically citing Russia's treatment of minorities.On 21 January 2014 Russian authorities sentenced left activist Vladislav Ryazantsev to 15 days. Ryazantsev is one of the leaders of the Left Front movement. He has been arrested allegedly for swearing at a bus stop late one evening.\nVladislav Ryazantsev and his fellow activists had planned to hold an action under the slogan of boycott of Sochi Olympics.On 5 February 2014 Russian authorities sentenced environmental activist Igor Kharchenko to five days. Kharchenko is member of the Russian NGO Environmental Watch for North Caucasus (Ecologicheskaya Vakhta po Severnomu Kavkazu). He has been arrested and his car was vandalized. Sergei Nikitin, Amnesty International's Moscow Office Director said: \"The Russian authorities must halt their harassment of civil society activists, protect the right to peaceful freedom of expression, and release the Sochi prisoners of conscience: Igor Kharchenko and his fellow environmentalist Yevgeny Vitishko, who is currently serving 15 days in administrative detention on trumped-up charges.\"Evgeny Vitishko was arrested for 15 days in the Sochi area reportedly charged allegedly for swearing at a bus stop. Yevgeniy Vitishko and his fellow activists have been actively involved in protests regarding the deforestation and illegal construction and fencing in areas of protected forest around Sochi. AI is concerned about his unfair trial resulted in a court decision to send him to prison colony for three years.\n\n\n=== Police arrests ===\nTwo members of the punk group Pussy Riot, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina, and a group of activists and journalists were arrested by Russian police in Sochi when simply walking down the street. Pussy Riot members have urged politicians attending the Winter Olympics to criticise human rights abuses in Russia. According to Amnesty International people are being targeted for peacefully speaking their minds. Almost daily there are reports of arrests of activists in Sochi and the Olympic Games area including Semyon Simonov Memorial, David Hakim and journalists from Radio Free Europe and Novaya Gazeta. Amnesty demanded the International Olympic Committee to condemn the arrests.\n\n\n=== LGBT rights ===\nThe rights of LGBT people in Russia were a concern leading up to the Games (where seven openly lesbian and bisexual, athletes, all female, were scheduled to participate). Russia became the subject of international criticism following the signing of a federal law by Vladimir Putin in June 2013, which banned the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors. Mass media classified the legislation as being \"anti-gay\", while LGBT rights activists considered the law to be too broad and vague, characterizing it as an effective ban on promoting LGBT rights and culture. Human Rights Campaign (HRC) president Chad Griffin argued that even kissing a same-sex partner or displaying LGBT symbols such as the rainbow flag could be illegal under the law. The legislation was also attributed to an increase in homophobic violence in Russia by anti-gay and Neo-Nazi groups. Critics also considered the law to be inconsistent with principle six of the Olympic Charter, which states that \"any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement.\" \"\n\n\n==== Assurances ====\nIn August 2013, the IOC stated that it had \"received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games\"; this was contradicted in a statement three days later made by Russia's Ministry of the Interior, which stated that the anti-propaganda laws would still be enforced in Sochi. The IOC also confirmed that it would enforce Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter, which forbids political protest, against athletes who make displays of support for the LGBT community. The IOC received written assurance from the Russian government in August 2013 stating that it was committed to abiding by the Olympic Charter during the Olympic Games. Vladimir Putin also made similar assurances prior to the Games, but warned LGBT attendees to abide by the law. Anatoly Pakhomov, mayor of Sochi, explained to reporters prior to the Games that homosexuality \"was not the custom in the Caucasus\", and claimed that no gays lived in Sochi at all (despite the presence of two gay clubs and evidence of a LGBT community in Sochi on a Russian social network). He went on to say that everyone, including gays, were welcome in Sochi, \"as long as they do not impose their habits on others.\"\n\n\n==== Protests and campaigns ====\nDespite these assurances, Olympic-focused protests and campaigns, such as the Principle 6 campaign (a collaboration between a group of Olympic athletes, the organizations All Out, Athlete Ally, and clothing maker American Apparel), have been held in protest of Russia's anti-gay policies. There were also calls to boycott the Games, drawing comparisons to the Summer Olympics of 1980 in Moscow. However, a writer for the Financial Times felt that such a boycott would be counter-productive, given that there was no boycott of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing despite China's poor human rights record, but suggested that action by Olympic sponsors would be more effective.At January, 2014 Russian leader of the Left Front movement Vladislav Ryazantsev together with like-minded persons opened out an informative campaign against Olympic Games in Sochi. In the social network of VK.com appeared the group \u00abBoycott of Olympic Games-2014 in Sochi\u00bb in which Ryazantsev united with left activist Anton Morvan publishes devastating information about the cost of Olympic Games and scales saw cut at its preparation. In addition, the group collects information about the game shooting of animals in the city-resort. \u2014 The Group \u00abBoycott of Olympic Games-2014 in Sochi\u00bb is one of many private initiatives of left activists. Its purpose is collection and publication of true information about violations, crimes and peculations during the preparation of the Olympic Games, helping to open eyes people\u00bb, \u2014 Vladislav Ryazantsev reported to the journalist of Donnews.ru. \u2014 \u00abIn addition, we call to declare boycott, avoid watching the games and buying commodities with symbolism of Olympic Games\u00bb.A number of world leaders, including United States president Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, declined to attend the Games' Opening Ceremony as delegates for various reasons. Although attending the Winter Olympics has not historically been a priority for world leaders, there was still speculation that their non-attendance was a symbolic boycott of Russian policies. The U.S. appointed tennis player Billie Jean King and women's hockey player Caitlin Cahow, who are both openly gay, as its delegation instead. Although Obama stressed diversity and made no reference to the controversy when announcing the delegation, on 6 February 2014, he confirmed the intent of the choices during an interview with Bob Costas aired by NBC the next day, stating that \"there is no doubt we wanted to make it very clear that we do not abide by discrimination in anything, including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\" Cahow stated that the decision was meant to \"[highlight] Americans who know what it means to have freedoms and liberties under the Constitution. That's really what we're representing in Sochi and it's not at all different from what's espoused in the spirit of Olympism.\"In February 2014, prior to the games, a group of 40 human rights organizations (including Athlete Ally, Freedom House, Human Rights Campaign, Human Rights Watch and Russian LGBT network among others) sent a joint letter to the ten Worldwide Olympic Partner companies, urging them to use their prominence to support the rights of LGBT athletes under the Olympic Charter, and pressure the IOC to show greater scrutiny towards the human rights abuses of future host countries. On 3 February 2014, USOC sponsor AT&T issued a statement in support of LGBT rights at the Games, becoming the first major Olympic advertiser to condemn the laws. Several major non-sponsors also made pro-LGBT statements to coincide with the opening of the Games; Google placed a quotation from the Olympic Charter and an Olympic-themed logo in the colors of the rainbow flag on its home page worldwide, while Channel 4 (who serves as the official British broadcaster of the Paralympics) adopted a rainbow-colored logo and broadcast a \"celebratory\", pro-LGBT advert entitled \"Gay Mountain\" on 7 February 2014, alongside an interview with former rugby union player and anti-homophobia activist Ben Cohen.The Huffington Post noted that the opening ceremony, ironically, featured tributes to \"some of history's most widely acclaimed and definitely gay Russians\", including composer Peter Tchaikovsky (1840-1893), ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky (1889-1950), and patron of arts, and founder of Ballets Russes, Sergei Diaghilev. Russian organizers denied any connection, stating that these figures were selected because of their cultural significance. On the same topic, critics also noted the Russian pop duo t.A.T.u were invited to perform during the opening ceremony; although they are not actually lesbian, the all-female duo were well known for incorporating themes of lesbianism in their music and on-stage personas (live appearances often featured the singers kissing each other), its name is a corruption of a shortened Russian phrase meaning \"this girl loves that girl\", and the duo made a statement in support of LGBT rights in the wake of Yuri Luzhkov's objection to the 2007 Moscow Pride parade. Organizers noted that t.A.T.u were chosen because they were well known to an international audience, denying any relation to LGBT rights.\n\n\n== Doping scandal ==\n\nIn December 2014, German public broadcaster ARD aired a documentary which made wide-ranging allegations that Russia organized a state-run doping program which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. In November 2015, Russia's track and field team was provisionally suspended by the IAAF.In May 2016, The New York Times published allegations by the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games. Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won at Sochi were the result of doping.In December 2016, following the release of the McLaren report on Russian doping at the Sochi Olympics, the International Olympic Committee announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes at the Sochi Olympic Games. La Gazzetta dello Sport reported the names of 17 athletes, of whom 15 are among the 28 under investigation.Three ladies artistic skaters were named as being under investigation. They are Adelina Sotnikova, the singles gold medalist, as well as pairs skaters Tatiana Volosozhar and Ksenia Stolbova. Volosozhar and Stolbova won gold and silver medals, respectively, in pairs skating. Both also won gold medals in the team event, which also puts the other eight team medalists at risk of losing their golds.\nSix skiers were provisionally suspended from competition on the basis of the McLaren report: Evgeniy Belov, Alexander Legkov, Alexey Petukhov, Maxim Vylegzhanin, Yulia Ivanova and Evgenia Shapovalova. Legkov won a gold medal, and Vylegzhanin won three silver medals.\nThe International Biathlon Union provisionally suspended two biathletes who were in the Sochi games: Olga Vilukhina and Yana Romanova, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport. Vilukhina won silver in sprint, and both women were on a relay team that won the silver medal. They both retired after the 2014/2015 season.\nThe International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation provisionally suspended four skeleton sliders. They are among the six athletes on the skeleton team: Nikita Tregubov, Alexander Tretyakov, Sergey Chudinov, Elena Nikitina, Maria Orlova and Olga Potylitsina. Tretyakov won a gold medal, and Nikitina won a silver.\nIt has been speculated that some Russia's Winter Olympians used xenon gas in preparation for the Sochi Games. Using xenon gas is not specifically banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA); however, it could be used for performance enhancement and raises questions about what constitutes doping and practices that should and should not be allowed.\n\n\n== Event judging ==\n\n\n=== Allegations of vote swapping ===\nFrench sports newspaper L'\u00c9quipe, quoting an anonymous Russian coach, alleged that Russia and the United States would swap votes, with the United States voting for Russian athletes in pairs figure skating and team events and Russia voting for the Americans in ice dancing. The allegations were categorically denied by U.S. Figure Skating.\n\n\n=== Men's ice hockey tournament ===\nDuring a men's ice hockey tournament round-robin game between USA and Russia, a Russian goal scored late in the third period, which would have given the team a 3-2 lead, was disallowed after referees ruled that the net was moved when the goal was scored. The decision resulted in the score remaining 2-2. USA went on to win the game in a shootout, which resulted in Russia playing a playoff qualification game while USA received a bye to the quarterfinals. The decision was criticized by many Russian politicians, TV hosts and commentators. Following the game, protesters led by the Kremlin party's youth group held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to protest the decision. In response to the controversy, Konstantin Komissarov, the referee supervisor of International Ice Hockey Federation, officially confirmed that the decision by the referee was correct, citing the appropriate use of video review in assessing the play.\n\n\n=== Ladies' singles figure skating ===\n\nImmediately after the final scores were announced, journalistic questions arose regarding whether 17 year old Russia\u2019s Adelina Sotnikova's performance deserved higher scores than the performances of the 23 year old figure skater South Korea\u2019s Yuna Kim. Questions over the judges, the judging system, and the anonymity of scores were also raised in the press.\n\n\n==== Official responses ====\nOn 21 February 2014, the International Skating Union (ISU) issued a statement which asserted all rules and procedures were applied during the competition and that no official protest had been filed by any participating nation concerning the results of the competition. Such a protest must be done within 30 minutes of the event.ISU's 21 February 2014 statement declaring their confidence \"in the high quality and integrity of the ISU judging system\". Adding \"judges were selected by random drawing from a pool of 13 potential judges\" and all nine judges on the free skating panel were from different nations.On 10 April, the Korean Olympic Committee (KOC) and the Korean Skating Union (KSU) filed an official complaint with the ISU Disciplinary Commission (DC) concerning judging. The complaint was regarding \"the wrongful constitution of the panel of judges and the unjust outcome of the competition\". It requested that the DC conduct a thorough investigation, \"take appropriate disciplinary actions against the concerned individuals\", and institute corrective actions. On 14 April, the DC ruled the complaint inadmissible because a general request for investigation is not within DC's jurisdiction and the complaint was not addressed at an individual or federation as required.On 30 April, the KOC and KSU filed a second official complaint with the DC. This time the complaint was against Alla Shekhovtsova and Figure Skating Federation of Russia (FSFR), specifically citing a hug Shekhovtsova shared with Sotnikova and Shekhovtsova's marriage to the current Director General of the FSFR. On 30 May, the DC dismissed the complaint. It ruled Shekhovtsova \"is not responsible for the judging panel's composition\", her marriage did not create a conflict of interest, and since Sotnikova initiated the hug, Shekhovtsova did not break any rules by responding.As of June 2014, the KOC and KSU are considering appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\n\n\n==== Opinions ====\nUSA Today reported \"A high-ranking Olympic figure skating official \u2026 said the geographic makeup of the judging panel 'was clearly slanted towards \u2026 Sotnikova.'\" The free skating panel included two Russian officials, a Russian judge and a Ukrainian judge. Journalists questioned the appointments of Russian judge Alla Shekhovtsova, the wife of the former president and the current general director of Figure Skating Federation of Russia Valentin Piseev, and Ukrainian judge Yuri Balkov, who was suspended for a year after being caught on tape attempting to fix the ice dancing competition at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The technical panel, that oversees correct execution of elements, is headed by fellow Russian Alexander Lakernik. Shekhovtseva was photographed hugging Sotnikova in the arena, raising another question of bias. The detailed score sheet shows that one judge gave Adelina Sotnikova +3 grade of execution (GOE) on all except two elements. In contrast, the score sheet of short program shows that one judge gave Yuna Kim +0 grade of execution on her triple flip, of which the NBC commentator Tracy Wilson commented as 'another perfect flip'.Journalists and experts argued that scores given to Adelina Sotnikova were inflated both in the short and long programs. She was inexplicably scored above all others in the free program, where most believed she merited only 4th place in the phase behind Yuna, Mao Asada, and Carolina Kostner. Many among them cite that certain judges gave generous scores along with fellow Russian competitor Yulia Lipnitskaya. In particular, numerous +3 grade of executions were handed out to the two Russian skaters as well as nods in component scores compared to other skaters. Others noted that Sotnikova made a mistake by stepping out of one of her jumps which got a -0.9 grade of execution in the scorecards. Ryan Bradley, 2011 US champion, asked \"Are we just going to ignore that she botched the landing of her 3 jump and pretend she was perfect?\" There are also debates about whether Sotnikova's triple lutz had a wrong edge on takeoff and the triple toe loop in her first jumping pass was under-rotated. Neither error was flagged by the event's technical panel.  Retired national-level figure skater Tim Gerber wrote a letter to the ISU, claiming that Sotnikova's triple triple combination jump should have received wrong edge and under rotation. Gerber also asserted that the step sequence levels were not correctly awarded for Kim and Sotnikova. He stated that Kim's step sequence should have received a level four (instead of three) and Sotnikova's step sequence should have received a level three (instead of four), as Sotnikova's step sequence elements in free skating didn't meet the requirements to get level four, and Kim's met the requirements enough to get level four.Katarina Witt, a two-time Olympic champion, stated \"I am stunned by this result, I don\u2019t understand the scoring.\" Several experts have also pointed out how Kim and Kostner's programs have significantly better artistry, choreography and skill on ice that should translate to higher component marks to other skaters. One judge in the scoresheets gave out significantly lower marks to Kim and Kostner in the component marks. Sonia Garbato, seven-time Olympic figure skating judge and former high-ranking ISU official, wrote: \"No fair judge \u2026 could have awarded to Adelina higher marks in choreography, performance/execution, and interpretation of the music.\" Four-time world champion Kurt Browning also expressed his surprise at the results, declaring that he did not understand how Kim and Sotnikova could have been so close in the programme component scores. He also pointed out how Sotnikova had her component scores boosted compared to her previous programs  Michael Weiss, a two-time world bronze medalist, wrote \"couldn't disagree more that Yuna and Sotnikova had basically same Component marks?..in Both short & long? Home field inflation.\"  Dick Button, two-time Olympic champion and longstanding skating analyst, commented: \"Sotnikova was energetic, strong, commendable, but not a complete skater.\" A petition in Change.org against the results of the event demanding an investigation and rejudgment has amassed over 2 million supporters breaking several web traffic records on the website.\n\n\n== Athlete selection controversies ==\nSeveral controversial choices of the athletes going to the Olympics to represent countries have occurred.\nThe participation of Lebanese alpine skier Jackie Chamoun became controversial in Lebanon after it was revealed at home in 2014 that she had posed in sexy photos for an Austrian calendar in 2011. A ministerial investigation has been mooted, while an online support protest \"Strip for Jackie\" has been organized. Chamoun has denied that she posed nude publicly on her Facebook page, saying that the behind the scenes images were not for publication.In South Korea, a furore has erupted over the loss of Viktor Ahn (Ahn Hyun-Soo) to Team Russia. Several newspapers reported the scorn of the Korean public and newspaper editors on the actions of the Korea Skating Union. The minister of sport and president of South Korea have both promised action in rooting out corruption and feuding at the organization that may have led to his \"defection\", in a bid to clean it up in preparation for the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. The Korean public is generally supportive of Ahn.Selection of Ashley Wagner over Mirai Nagasu by the United States Olympic Team for ladies' singles figure skating caused some controversy, as at the selection competition, Nagasu finished ahead of Wagner. Wagner was selected on the body of her work, instead of the strength of her selection performance. The unclear selection process, and the fact that the second-place finisher Polina Edmunds had no international experience lead to some calls of racism, as the selection of Wagner over Nagasu was due to international results, while Edmunds' was not. This was the first time that the USFSA (United States Figure Skating Association) selected a skater who had competed in the selection trials and lost over another on who had also competed, previous times had done this only for skaters who had been injured and unable to compete at trials.Following the games in July, four Slovenian officials were suspended for four years from FIS after they helped to falsify times and rankings to allow alpine skier Vanessa Vanakorn (best known as the British violinist Vanessa-Mae and represented for Thailand as her father is a Thai) to achieve an average of 140 points of fewer at an FIS event to enable her to qualify for Olympics. At an FIS event in Krvavec, where she achieved her required score, she finished 6th (and last) in the national junior championships, despite being over 14 years older to the next eldest contestant. She also finished 7th (but last), 9th (of 13th) and 10th (of 13th). She finished with a total time of 3:26.97, 50.10 seconds behind the winner, Tina Maze of Slovenia. She was last among the finishers, ranking 67th. During investigations by FIS, it was revealed that the event was fixed to enable her to compete, for example a result including a competitor who was not present in the races, was placed 2nd in one race despite falling and her time was adjusted afterwards by more than 10 seconds, enabling a previously retired competitor who had the best FIS points in the competition to lower the penalty to benefit participants, failing to alter the course between runs and allowing the race to be run despite being suitable under regulations. As a result of taking part in a race rigged to her favor in an event orchestrated by her manager, Vanakorn was banned from skiing for four years.\n\n\n== Pegasus Airlines Flight 751 ==\nOn 7 February 2014, during the opening ceremony and one day after the start of the 2014 Winter Olympics, a man attempted to hijack Pegasus Airlines Flight 751 that was on a flight from Kharkiv, Ukraine, to Istanbul, Turkey, saying he had a bomb on board, and demanding to be flown to Sochi, the host city of the 2014 Winter Olympics. The pilots turned off the inflight monitors and landed at Istanbul's Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en Airport, fooling the man into thinking he was landing in Sochi. The plane, a Boeing 737-800 reg TC-CCP, was escorted to Istanbul by two Turkish F-16 fighter jets. The man, who appeared to be severely intoxicated, was detained by police and taken to the Istanbul Security Headquarters. In 2018, Russia's President Vladimir Putin admitted that he ordered the shooting down of a passenger plane that was reportedly carrying a bomb and targeting the opening of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\nDespite several expert statements that the construction of Olympic venues in the buffer area of the UNESCO protected Caucasus Biosphere Reserve and Sochi National Park could be harmful, the IOC approved the plans. Greenpeace of Russia said that the IOC and the Russian Government assumed all responsibility for any damage to the West Caucasus natural UNESCO World Heritage Site. According to the Sochi bid, a wide array of construction was planned in the Grushevyi Ridge area. They included a cascade of hydroelectric power stations on the Mzymta River, sewage treatment facilities, a high-speed rail link, a Mountain Olympic Village, a track for bobsleigh, luge and skeleton (which was relocated in May 2009), and a biathlon venue. Alpine skiing venues were being constructed in the Rosa Khutor plateau and the Psekhako Ridge area. Environmentalists proposed building up Krasnaya Polyana instead of destroying nature reserve sites.\nEnvironmentalists also opposed the plan of construction of a cargo terminal for ships in the mouth of the Psou River in the Imereti Lowland, because this could lead to the destruction of the largest areas of sea-flooded shore and marshes.On 3 July 2008, Vladimir Putin directed some of the Olympic venues, such as the luge and bobsleigh track, to be relocated (the Russian National Sliding Centre was relocated in May 2009). He said \"In setting our priorities and choosing between money and the environment, we're choosing the environment.\"Geologist Sergei Volkov fled to Ukraine after speaking out about environmental and geological problems. He stated that mercury and uranium deposits, as well as the probability of landslides, made the location of the games hazardous. He also argued that the location of a cargo port was inappropriate. A storm there killed three seamen and destroyed $14 million of infrastructure.On 29 October 2013 it was reported that Russia broke its 'Zero Waste' Olympic Pledge, as it emerged that Russia's state-owned rail monopoly was dumping tons of construction waste into an illegal landfill, raising concerns of possible contamination in the water that directly supplies Sochi.\n\n\n== Animal rights ==\nThe issue of stray dogs has come up before the Olympics. On 3 February 2014, the city hired a firm to exterminate the stray population \u2013 an approach that has brought international condemnation. These plans have been abandoned after complaints by local citizens. The stray dogs will be collected from the streets and put in a shelter.Russia originally planned to have two orca whales perform in the opening ceremonies of the Sochi 2014 Olympics. They were two of eight whales captured off the coast of Russia. After backlash by various advocacy groups and petitions signed by the general public, a statement was released that the whales would not be part of the Olympics. The current whereabouts of the whales are unknown.\nIt was rumored that the committee had planned to have a dolphin trained to carry the Olympic torch. Activists spoke up about the issue immediately, causing the President of the Olympics Committee, Dmitry Chernyshenko, to issue the statement that, \"I confirm that we do not involve any orcas or dolphins for the Olympics.\" Whether or not there had been any plans for a dolphin torchbearer has never been confirmed.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAccording to The New York Times the $50 billion or so lavished on Sochi is becoming a political liability. The stalling of the economy, despite the stimulus of Olympic spending, has raised worries about popular unrest directed at the Kremlin and a tightening of political freedoms in response once the Games are over. \"It is about what Russia could have done with this money.\" said Aleksei A. Navalny, the Foundation for the Fight Against Corruption.According to IRN.Ru analytical agency, prices for land, located next to the shoreline, reach $150,000 per 100 m\u00b2, while price per square metre in average panel apartment building on the outskirts of the city already reaches $2000. \"As a result of 2014 Olympics euphoria prices will rise annually by 15\u201320%,\" speculates Irina Tyurina, press secretary of Russian Tourist Industry Union. This could lead to decrease in tourist interest to Sochi, which already has fallen below Anapa, Gelendzhik and Adler.After the IOC Evaluation Commission visited Sochi in February 2007, local authorities promised to buy the lands from Lower Imereti Bay long-time residents for a fair market price. But during the following half a year, no local resident could get their land approved as private property.While most Olympic Games have high cost overruns, for these Games they are much higher than usual. Much of the cost overruns have been blamed on corruption, with Boris Nemtsov claiming: \"The Sochi Olympics are an unprecedented thieves' caper in which representatives of Putin's government are mixed up along with the oligarchs close to the government.\"  According to research by Transparency International, a global anti-corruption watchdog, approximately 50 percent or more of the building costs went to corruption.Poor workers conditions and rights have also been raised as an issue of concern, with at least 25 people dying and many more injured in accidents on sites in 2012 and with workers not getting paid at all.\n\n\n== Circassians ==\n\nCircassian organisations have also spoken out against the Olympics, arguing that the Games will take place on land that had been inhabited by them since the beginning of recorded history by their ancestors until 1864, when the resolution of the Russian\u2013Circassian War was stated to have caused the disappearance (variously by death or deportation) of 1.5 million Circassians, or 90-94% of the Circassian nation. They are demanding the Sochi 2014 Olympics be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologises for what the Circassians regard to be a genocide. Some Circassian groups have not expressed outright opposition to the Olympics but argue that symbols of Circassian history and culture should be included in the format, as Australia, the United States, and Canada did with their indigenous populations in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.The games are viewed to be particularly offensive because they include the date of the 150th anniversary of what they consider a genocide. It has thus been a rallying cry for Circassian nationalists.In particular, there is much ire over the use of a hill called \"Red Hill\". In 1864, a group of Circassians apparently tried to return home but were attacked and a battle ensued, ending in their massacre, and attaining the name \"Red Hill\" (for the blood spilled). There were skiing and snowboarding events planned to be held on this hill.\n\n\n== Political stability and governance ==\nThe 2008 Russia\u2013Georgia war, which broke out at the start of the 2008 Summer Olympics, surprised the Olympic community. \"It is not what the world wants to see. It is contrary to what the Olympic ideal stands for\", said an IOC spokesperson. However, in November 2008, the IOC turned down a request by the Georgian National Olympic Committee to reconsider its decision to hold the Olympics on the territory \"adjacent both to the [Russian-]occupied Abkhaz conflict zone, and to the extremely unstable and volatile North Caucasus\".\nRelated concerns persist, regarding the region's safety and the desirability of hosting an Olympics in a conflict-ridden zone. \"The region is such a muddied and bloodied aquarium of conflict that to pick out any one fish is impossible,\" says Oleg Nechiporenko, chief analyst for Russia's National Anti-Terrorist and Anti-Criminal Fund, in response to a 26 May 2010, car bombing, whose suspects include Russian nationalists, local Russian mafia groups, separatists and Islamists in the North Caucasus, or a remnant of the war in Abkhazia.Sochi borders Russia's six autonomous North Caucasus republics, home of the Second Chechen War which allegedly face social problems. According to an article in Daily Telegraph, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, head of Saudi intelligence, allegedly confronted the Kremlin with a mix of inducements and threats in a bid to break the deadlock over Syria. This included security of winter olympics in Sochi if there is no accord. \"I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us,\" he allegedly said.Russian Envoy to the North Caucasus Alexander Khloponin told local law enforcement that \"the violent scramble for assets\" is likely to get worse as Russia invests heavily in tourist infrastructure and Olympic-caliber ski resorts.\n\n\n=== Safety ===\nThree suicide bombings in Volgograd, one in October 2013 and the others in December 2013, have raised additional international concerns about security during the Olympics. The IOC expressed sympathy for the victims and underlined that they trusted that Russia's security arrangements for the Olympics would be adequate.The British, German, Italian, Hungarian, Austrian, Slovenian and Slovakian Olympic associations received threats that athletes would be \"blown up\" or kidnapped by terrorists at the Winter Games. According to the IOC, the letters did not represent any real threat.\n\nOn 7 February 2014, during the opening ceremony, a Pegasus Airlines flight from Kharkiv, Ukraine, to Istanbul, Turkey, was threatened by a passenger who attempted to hijack the jetliner with a demand to be flown to Sochi. The man would be detained by police and taken into custody.\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nIOC President Thomas Bach criticized attempts to politicize the Games, saying that governments should not send political messages \"on the backs of their athletes.\" Benjamin Bidder of Spiegel Online and Julia Ioffe of The New Republic compared the negative pre-Sochi coverage to schadenfreude and Russophobia, while Anton Fedyashin of The Guardian blamed lingering Cold War mentalities for \"dishing up a feast of negativity.\" In an editorial published by The Nation, scholar of Russian studies Stephen F. Cohen criticized the \"toxic coverage\" for \"exploiting the threat of terrorism so licentiously it seemed pornographic.\" He further wrote that \"American media on Russia today are less objective, less balanced, more conformist and scarcely less ideological than when they covered Soviet Russia during the Cold War.\"According to The Guardian the games were more politicised than the before, serving as shameless promotion of Putin's Russia. While former world chess champion and Russian opposition figure Garry Kasparov said that game bolstered Putin's cult of personality.Comedians and satirical newspapers took advantage of the widespread pessimism. On 8 February, The Daily Currant posted a story alleging that a man responsible for operating the Olympic rings during the opening ceremony, which famously suffered a technical glitch, had been \"found dead...with multiple stab wounds.\" The fictional story went viral on social media. On 20 February, luger Kate Hansen posted a well-publicized video on her Twitter account allegedly showing a wolf roaming the hallways of her Sochi hotel; it was later revealed to be a hoax staged by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and Hansen. USA Luge officials distanced themselves from the incident, with spokesman Sandy Caligiore stating, \"I can tell you that our organization is not happy with the incident. Sochi problems? Sochi fail? That's not USA Luge speaking.\" Throughout the duration of the Olympics the @SochiProblems Twitter account had nearly 100,000 more followers than the official IOC feed @Sochi2014. The blog GossipSochi.com was later set up to debunk @SochiProblems postings, with many revealed to be fakes.In an interview, IOC supervisor Jean-Claude Killy stated that several hotels intended to house the foreign media were unfinished by the opening of the Olympics because officials realized \"too late\" that construction had fallen behind. According to David Wallechinsky, president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, many of the incidents early in the Olympics were \"standard problems\" and were not unique to Sochi. Wallechinsky further noted, \"When you mess up with the media before the Games start, you're going to have a problem.\" In an interview that aired on Russian television on 24 February, Vladimir Putin opined that much of the criticism stemmed from rivalry in international politics, saying \"There is a cohort of critics that are far from sport, they are engaged in a competitive struggle in international politics. They used this Olympic project to achieve their own objectives in the field of anti-Russian propaganda.\"The mood greatly improved as the Games progressed. With a few notable exceptions, NBC largely avoided broadcasting negative material, although several segments deemed \"overly friendly to Russia\" were criticized by some U.S. commentators. Following the closing ceremony, Mark Sappenfield of The Christian Science Monitor concluded that by many measures the Olympics were \"very successful.\" Sappenfield singled out the organization as particularly good, writing that \"Athletes and Olympic officials were nearly unanimous: This was an extraordinarily well run Olympics.\" Thomas Bach also voiced support, stating \"We saw excellent Games and what counts most is the opinions of the athletes and they were enormously satisfied...You have to ask all those who criticised whether they change their opinions now.\"\n\n\n== 2014 Russian Formula One Grand Prix ==\nIn 2014, Sochi hosted the Russian Formula One Grand Prix. The circuit runs in and around the Sochi Olympic Park, which led to the IOC expressing concern that construction of the circuit could disrupt preparations for the Olympic Games. The IOC was granted the power to delay the inaugural race until 2015 in order to ensure the Olympics were held without disruption, but did not use it as competition was not disrupted.\n\n\n== Countries choosing not to enter competitors ==\nA total of 91 nations qualified to compete at the Games. However, three nations chose not to send their athletes to the Games, even though they had met the international qualification standards.\nPuerto Rico is not sending Kristina Krone for the second consecutive time because the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee (COPUR) withdrew its recognition of the Puerto Rico Winter Sports Federation after the 2002 Winter Olympics due to an eligibility controversy involving a member of their bobsled team. According to COPUR president Sara Rosario, \"Until there is a properly constituted winter sports federation with the requisite seriousness upon which we can consistently rely every four years, we cannot endorse (participation by Puerto Rico athletes in the Olympic Winter Games)\". Krone has represented Puerto Rico since 2008 in more than 100 alpine ski competitions sanctioned by the International Ski Federation including the 2009, 2011 and 2013 World Alpine Ski Championships.South Africa would not enter skier Sive Speelman, who, although invited to compete by the IOC, did not meet the standards set by the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee.Algeria also chose not to enter its only competitor, Mehdi-Selim Khelifi, because he was the only one that managed to qualify, even though he was their only entry four years prior at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\n\n== Independent participants ==\nThere were three Independent Olympic participants from India who competed under the Olympics flag. In December 2012, the Indian Olympic Association was suspended by the IOC due to government interference in the autonomy and election of leaders, thus not complying with the Olympic charter. Fresh elections were due to take place after the opening ceremony so Indian athletes were scheduled to participate as independents.\n\n\n== Course adjustments ==\nA crash in practice from Norwegian slopestyle snowboarder Torstein Horgmo, who fractured his collarbone, and complaints from other athletes that some jumps were too steep have prompted organizers to modify the slopestyle course in the week before the Games. A few days later the women's downhill ski training was stopped after the opening three racers were getting too much air on the jump down the home stretch. The International Ski Federation had workers adjusting the course making it smoother.\n\n\n== Inadequate preparation of visitor facilities ==\nIn the week prior to the start of the Games, reports began coming out of Sochi that a number of the accommodations for visitors and journalists were still incomplete. Several hotels meant to house visitors to the Games were reported to be still under construction upon arrival, as well as missing basic furniture from some of the rooms that had finished construction. The issues forced a number of visitors to seek alternate accommodations. Other problems reported included \"piles of garbage\" on the streets of the media village, as well as significant construction noise.Other notable incidents:\n\nJohnny Quinn, member of the US bobsled team, became trapped in his bathroom and had to bash a hole in the door to get out.\nStacy St. Clair, Chicago Tribune reporter, reported that her hotel had no water, and that staff informed her that when it returned, not to wash her face in it as it was dangerous. The water service that returned provided murky dark water. The \"dangerous face water\" incident went viral.\n\n\n== Use of mourning symbols ==\nDuring the women's 15 kilometre skiathlon four Norwegian skiers used black mourning binds in honor of teammate Astrid Uhrenholdt Jacobsen's brother who had died unexpectedly on the opening day of the Olympics. IOC sent a reminder to the Norwegian Olympic Committee (NOC) that using mourning binds was not allowed during the games. IOC's letter caused protests in Norway and Sweden. NOC general secretary Inge Andersen met with IOC president Thomas Bach to discuss the matter on 10 February 2014. Norway's IOC member Gerhard Heiberg indicated that IOC would reconsider the ban against mourning binds.Freestyle skiers were told by IOC not to wear helmet stickers in memory of Sarah Burke, who died in an accident in 2012. However, many still did, and the rule was believed to not have been enforced.\nOn 19 February Ukrainian athletes asked for and were refused permission by the IOC to wear black arm bands to honor those killed in the violent clashes in Kiev the previous day. According to IOC spokesman Mark Adams \"They weren't forbidden to wear armbands. The Ukrainian NOC met with IOC officials informally yesterday. They discussed what should be done, and they reached the conclusion there were other ways of marking this moment. Some athletes have taken other views and other ways of doing things\". IOC president Bach offered his condolences \"to those who have lost loved ones in these tragic events\".\n\n\n== Athlete boycott ==\nOn 19 February 2014 Ukrainian alpine skier Bohdana Matsotska refused to further participate in the Olympic Games in protest of the violent clashes in Kiev on the previous day. She and her father posted a message on Facebook stating \"In solidarity with the fighters on the barricades of the Maidan, and as a protest against the criminal actions made towards the protesters, the irresponsibility of the president and his lackey government, we refuse further performance at the Olympic Games in Sochi 2014\".On 20 February 2014 the Ukrainian NOC reported that as many as half of the 45 Ukrainian athletes at the Olympics had left the games to return home. But according to Ukrainian NOC president Sergey Bubka they had returned home in compliance with their original schedule, and their departure was thus not related to the riots in Kiev.\n\n\n== Drug tests ==\nDuring the 2014 Winter Olympics, six athletes tested positive for banned substances and were sent home from the Games.\nOn 21 February, skier Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle of Germany and Italian bobsleigh brakeman William Frullani were both sent home from Sochi after failing drugs tests. They both tested positive for methylhexanamine. On 22 February, Ukrainian cross-country skier Marina Lisogor was tested positive for trimetazidine and Latvian ice hockey player Vitalijs Pavlovs tested positive for methylhexaneamine. On 23 February, Austrian skier Johannes D\u00fcrr tested positive for EPO and Swedish ice hockey player Nicklas B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m tested positive for a substance found in an allergy medication.\n\n\n== Men's freestyle skiing \u2013 ski cross ==\nBoth Canada and Slovenia appealed separately to the Court of Arbitration for Sport that the three French athletes in the Big Final of the men's ski cross final had their pants illegally changed by their coach. They argued it gave the three an aerodynamic advantage over the rest of the field. Both countries first appealed to the International Ski Federation, but were rejected since they appealed hours after the end of the competition (when the deadline was 15 minutes after the close of the race). The appeal to the court was ultimately unsuccessful as well, because the court agreed with the ski federation that the appeal was filed past the deadline.\n\n\n== Russian Mafia used to threaten rival campaign allegations ==\nThe Russian mafia helped Russia win the games by threatening the Salzburg campaign leader Fedor Radmann, who later resigned in 2007, according to German security officials. Informants observed a meeting between mafia leaders and Russian government foreign policy advisor Sergei Prikhodko in 2006 in a Munich restaurant to discuss the Olympic selection process. Radmann himself denies he ever met any Russian mobsters but his colleagues state that he feared for his life, and the mayor of Salzburg Heinz Schaden confirms the link.\n\n\n== See also ==\nConcerns and controversies at the 2010 Winter Olympics\nConcerns and controversies at the 2012 Summer Olympics\nList of 2018 FIFA World Cup controversies\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The aquarium is small. The price of the ticket is obviously overpriced. You can feed the fish with special food that is sold inside. Next to the entrance is a pool enclosed with colored mazaykoy, though without water. \u2026",
          "Oceanarium interesting. Beautiful fish. Beautiful aquariums. There are small sharks. Many stingrays, but small stingrays. There is an opportunity to feed the fish. Food can be purchased in the same machine. Of the \u2026",
          "Very poor exhibition. Price does not match content\n\n",
          "For children it will be interesting, but not for adults. All fish and marine creatures can be seen in ordinary zoos. Expected much more for the marine aquarium. A little disappointed. And work, please, with the staff \u2026",
          "We are going around so-so, nothing special, the size is small. The price tag of 800 rubles did not live up to expectations, it is better to go half the price in the Riviera park\n\n",
          "A good aquarium with a variety of marine life. Everything is beautifully decorated, lights everywhere. You can take pictures without flash. You can purchase special food and feed the fish. An adult ticket costs 800 \u2026",
          "Clean, well-kept aquariums, beautiful inhabitants of the expanses of water. I was pleased that between the expositions there are spacious, beautifully decorated areas between the halls, enough light for selfies. \u2026",
          "Interesting place for children, a lot of different fish. But on the day off it is better not to meddle, a giant line of people at the checkout. If you want to save your time, then look for a shop with tickets at the \u2026",
          "A show of mermaids is a must see for everyone. Children will be thrilled. The rest is small and not very interesting.\n\n",
          "In general, I really liked it. An interesting place to visit especially with children. If you have never been sure to visit.\n\n",
          "Large, modern aquarium. Yes, there is something to see. This is my second visit. It is sad that the number of aquariums decreased, their condition worsened significantly.\n\n",
          "Not bad, but not enough for the price of 800 rubles per ticket\n\n",
          "Caught on feeding fish and shows with mermaids. The children were very impressed. You can feed the carp straight from the hands. Wow\n\n",
          "Beautiful, interesting excursions, many \"representatives of the vast expanses of water\", little mermaids under water entertain guests in a large \"aquarium\". There is a souvenir shop. We were with the whole family \u2026",
          "a lot of fish and other aquatic inhabitants. there are good performances with mermaids and a fish feeder.\n\nin the first photograph, the man who feeds the fish hugs the turtle\n\n",
          "If you were in a Moscow house or the like, then do not waste money. 15-20 minutes will go for everything. If the first time, then it will be quite good\n\n",
          "Getting is not convenient, parking is paid. Cashless payment did not work. We did not take cash. Waited an hour until the terminal is working. We got a check, but it turned out that the payment did not go through due \u2026",
          "A wonderful place to relax with the whole family, it occupies two floors, you can hide from the heat of the day and enjoy the fish, the tour is interesting, a magical performance with the Little Mermaid, you can feed \u2026",
          "Honestly - this time they didn\u2019t go inside. For insane money without normal discounts, for example, having many children, there was a lineup on April 3. Because there is nowhere else to go! With the children, the sea \u2026",
          "It was cool!\nWe liked)\nIt was beautiful and interesting there! \ud83d\ude04\nThere were our favorite turtles and stingrays (which are so funny \ud83d\udc25)\n\n",
          "Good, but not very large aquarium. If possible, it is better to visit Moskumrium. And if you were there, there is nothing to do.\nThe only highlight is that a mermaid is swimming with fish in one of the aquarian \u2026",
          "I was not impressed: everything is in the twilight, not only are the tickets expensive, but also photography is paid, feed the fish - give me the money again. And at the exit, the souvenir museum - the prices are \u2026",
          "A lot of fish, it is interesting to watch them. There is an opportunity for an additional fee to listen to the tour of the Oceanarium. It is interesting to feed the fish \ud83d\ude0a\n\n",
          "Very interesting, informative, cool! You can immediately get on two shows, if advance familiarize yourself with the program. We observed feeding and the show \ud83e\udddc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and the human amphibian. \ud83d\udc4d\n\n",
          "A bunch of ordinary fish, which can be seen in home aquariums.\nExotics very little. Sharks are there and it's cool, but they are few. Literally pieces 5-6. A pair of large moray eels. Big turtle ... Underwater tunnel. \u2026",
          "Somehow gloomy and dreary. Maybe because they were in the winter ...\n\n",
          "Were in aquariums in different countries, ours is not inferior to anything! Respect\n\n",
          "So far the best aquarium that I have seen. Beautiful, clean. A lot of fish, souvenirs to remember. Even got to the underwater show with mermaids. It only spoils the lack of signposts and close parking for visiting the \u2026",
          "Little. I expected more. There are few fish. 800 adults and 500 children for this similarity is expensive. Children did not like it.\n\n",
          "Beautiful, interesting. The price is expensive for me. 800 rub. for an adult, 500 for children. Stood in line for 1 hour, a little less time spent there.\n\n",
          "The show of mermaids and when the driver feeds the fish leave an unforgettable experience !!!\n\n",
          "It\u2019s interesting, especially with children, you can study the types of fish) there is an aquarium tunnel Another room where white lights in the dark is also cool)) there is a gift shop on the territory, a toilet and \u2026",
          "Perfect place! So many different fishes! Beautiful illuminated aquariums, near each plate with the name of the inhabitants and information about them. There are open aquariums with koi fish that you can feed! Funny \u2026",
          "I liked it very much, everyone should visit at least once, in the summer the queues are certainly straining\n\n",
          "The ticket is expensive, the aquarium is too small. At the entrance is a beautiful jungle, fish in the pools and aquariums. The main plus is feeding fish, one capsule with food 50 rubles (cash only), a 2.5-year-old \u2026",
          "A good place to stay for the whole family. Here you can find out a lot of interesting things about the underwater world. Take an excursion. Not expensive, but much more interesting.\n\n",
          "The child was very interesting to consider different fish. You can even feed some if you buy food there (worth 50 rubles). It is very interesting when the aquarium passes overhead.\n\n",
          "Good aquarium. Cost of attendance: adult 800\u20bd, child from 4 years old 500\u20bd, + 50\u20bd feed - you can not deprive a child of such a pleasure to feed carps. I think it's a little expensive for this aquarium, although I got \u2026",
          "If you want your rest to be remembered not only burnt back - go to the aquarium. Tickets are not cheap, but when you come in, you will understand what you are paying for. A lot of fish and sea animals. And also here \u2026",
          "Not interested at all. The price does not justify the high.\n\n",
          "The ticket is for an adult + -800, and for children 500. The oceanarium looks large, but it seemed small to me. There is information about each fish, shark.\n\n",
          "Oceanarium is one name.\nWith Moskvarium not compare. The exposure is small, but money is taken normally. It is not worth it.\n\n",
          "Great place, it is necessary to the room .... if they have never been, then especially, especially for children .. it is less than 2 times Moscow exactly, but still interesting ... it's impossible to park near ... \u2026",
          "Small benches are important along the way. A lot of children, nowhere to sit. It's minus\n\n",
          "Very beautiful and interesting for children and adults! The main thing when visiting is not to forget warm clothes, the halls are quite cool.\n\n",
          "Disappointment! Expecting something more. Well, yes, fish. In the zoo, too. The tunnel .. Not very ... The passage is very narrow, everyone is photographed. It seems that people were not very many, but closely. It is \u2026",
          "Large aquarium. Like the whole family. Children are delighted as well as parents. There are sharks, turtles, Koi fish and other animals. Entrance fee is 800 rubles per adult, children under 5 are free.\n\n",
          "Very cool, but expensive all the same. 800.00 rubles is too much. If my memory serves me, then in Antalya it\u2019s cheaper to go, but the sizes can\u2019t be compared\n\n",
          "Small but cozy. Aquariums with sea fish are not many and not very diverse. The performances of the \"mermaids\" are a huge plus, for the aquarium, exactly like feeding fish (50 rubles a portion of food). The price of \u2026",
          "Inside the stuffiness !!! We traveled from Riviera Park by bus, the journey took about 30-40 minutes. In front of the aquarium park. Inside there are many types of fish, it is interesting to watch them.\n\n",
          "A lot of people, a lot of people.\nExpected a smaller crush and a larger area.\nIf you are close, then go. Going specifically - it makes no sense.\n\n",
          "Everything is good here, a lot of fish and marine life. But I was in Anapa in the aquarium and there it\u2019s almost the same, except for the tunnels of glass, but the glass is blurry, so you need to come close anyway. \u2026",
          "A good place to visit with children. The oceanarium is not big, but spectacular. And children do not have time to get tired. You can buy food and feed the carp. A good gift shop. Not very convenient access and small \u2026",
          "A good option for both children and adults.\n\n",
          "We liked the children of 5 and 7 years old! Were on Wednesday after 14.00 in the beginning of October. There were few people. The size of the exposure is less than in Antalya, but it seemed more interesting to us) \u2026",
          "A lot of aquarium fish. In specialized stores, aquariums are better decorated. In a large marine aquarium, mermaids are clearly superfluous.\n\n",
          "Modern, well, beautiful. Wonderful color scheme in the design. A variety of fish. Good intellectual and aesthetic entertainment for the family. Ticket 800. But do not regret paying extra 50 for the tour. Photos for \u2026",
          "Moscow is better\n\n",
          "Just super. Not only children were delighted, but also adults. The mermaids show alone is worth it.\n\n",
          "everything is fine, but the staff is rude, and go to the toilet at the entrance, they will not let me go back\n\n",
          "The aquarium is good, but in bad weather, with an influx, stupid staff can not cope. \"Are we to blame for the fact that so many of you have come here?\" Queue for an hour and a half.\n\n",
          "In principle, everything is fine, I don\u2019t know, they write the negative, why are you going here, go where you feel good, I have also been to different parts of the world and have seen a lot, but about this I can say \u2026",
          "Huge aquarium. When we were there with the child for the first time - there were many impressions. I especially liked to feed the fish in the outdoor pools))\n\n",
          "I like this place very much, you can feed carp here. There are benches, and a huge panoramic aquarium. There is an elevator. There is a huge lack of toilet only at the entrance !!! There are problems with children. \u2026",
          "It is very beautiful, at 14.00 feeding of marine inhabitants begins, the cat turns into a show, lasts about 30 minutes, at 15.00 they start fascinatingly dancing in the main mermaid aquarium. Children are delighted \u2026",
          "I like it. Yes, it is small, not comparable with Moscow or Barcelona, but it has everything you need: many species of fish, an unusual interior, a real mermaid (the child watched spellbound) and Ihtiandr, a \u2026",
          "The price is unreasonably high. The aquarium is small. There\u2019s nothing to look at. Were in the Oceanarium on about. Russian, there really is a gorgeous oceanarium.\n\n",
          "Interesting. It is a pity because of the large number of visitors is not well considered. And the prices I think bent.\n\n",
          "Like me and kids. A bunch of beautiful inhabitants of the sea and ocean depths. Fascinating mermaid show. Thank you for the pleasant impressions, will be back again.\n\n",
          "Awful Huge lines that have no end. Tickets can be bought exclusively at the box office on the spot or from resellers standing at the crossings. There is no question of the possibility of buying an online ticket in \u2026",
          "Interesting, but too many people. Had to stand in line to watch. Allowed with strollers and scooters. The child was driven into the crowd by a stroller, the impression was spoiled\n\n",
          "Gorgeous aquarium, you can feed the fish, but I would like to see more. The aquarium itself is not big, but in general this is enough\n\n",
          "It is impossible to compare with the Israeli aquarium Adlersky. Although there are many fishes of different sorts; which you can feed. In Israel it is impossible!\nSnake terrarium is impressive\n\nAnd the Mermaid show is \u2026",
          "Great place. I advise everyone. 800 rubles an adult ticket. 50 rubles guide\n\n",
          "Very interesting! It is a pity that there are no jellyfish ... And I would like for more exhibits! The decor class! In general, you can go!\n\n",
          "Expectations were more than I saw. It\u2019s hard to call a large aquarium. Small and very small fish exposure\n\n",
          "Were at the aquarium for the second time, there is always something to see, I really like going there, watching fish, especially stingrays and small sharks.\nThis time I was lucky to meet a diver in one of the pools, \u2026",
          "The place is not as big as you see it ...\n\n",
          "Got to the aquarium very well. There were few people, only our excursion group. Children were interested.\n\n",
          "Very great place for the whole family. Clean, tidy, staff are polite. And a lot of all marine life, including moray eels and sharks.\n\n",
          "I would put five if it were not for the Russian approach. (If you have children, then it\u2019s most interesting for them to see a mermaid in the aquarium. From Sochi, we drove a special hour to see the little mermaid. \u2026",
          "This is a must see. Words are hard.\n\n",
          "Diving is great. The instruction is excellent. Super coach\n\n",
          "Very nice and informative. Great tour guide for a minimal fee. Mermaid show just class.\n\n",
          "If you are interested in the secrets of the underwater world - you definitely need to visit the Adler Oceanarium. You will not only get acquainted with the inhabitants of the depths, read interesting information about \u2026",
          "The cost does not match the proposed service. The ticket price was supposed to be 400 rubles, at least from children under 14, for 2 adults and two children paid 3200 rubles, this is overkill. Maybe there would be \u2026",
          "Three times less than the Moscow Oceanarium. The price tag of \u00a3 800 per adult is overstated, of course. It is suitable to spend time during the rest \"seal\". Stuffy when a lot of people. A \u201cfree\u201d photo with jaws at the \u2026",
          "A show with mermaids, a beautiful background in each aquarium, the ability to feed the inhabitants, but in general the aquarium is not large and runs very quickly.\n\n",
          "We got to the show presentation on 12/31/2019, under the IMPRESSION !!!\n\n",
          "I thought it would be better. Not as big as they say. Better - sharks, feeding turtles and feeding fish (such as carpics chtoli)\n\n",
          "I\u2019ve already said and uploaded the photo, and once again I\u2019ll say we are just delighted. The animals show that they work not from under the stick. Who has the opportunity to go, do not regret it!\n\n",
          "Cool, remembering childhood. In the very south of ours. In Adler (although they write Sochi). Adler is. The very one. And reluctance to leave\n\n",
          "Everything was very good and wonderful. The kids really liked it. Thank you very much.\n\n",
          "For the first time, they were in this aquarium. Compared to St. Petersburg, it\u2019s relatively small. But it will be interesting. They stood in line for tickets for 45 minutes, 35 minutes inside)))))\n\n",
          "If you have been to the Oceanarium in Moscow - you will find a huge disappointment here. Besides the fact that the minimum exposure. Serious difficulties with ventilation. It's hard to breathe. The child became sick. \u2026",
          "All liked it. It\u2019s bad that a very large queue for tickets. People stand even on the street.\n\n",
          "Staff dissatisfied, long queues, very few sea animals. It costs 800 rubles 1 adult ticket. If you walk along the ocean very slowly and read everything that is written, then it will take you all 50 minutes. The price \u2026",
          "Very interesting! But still a little expensive. The whole family visited 2900 ... And it was stuffy in the gallery, they were about 8 years ago, nothing has changed in this regard, unfortunately\n\n",
          "Nice place. Not the largest, of course, of those that we visited. But there were good impressions!\n\n",
          "Would have liked for younger children. Child 14l was not very interesting. Yes, and the price is too high, does not correspond to what he saw\n\n",
          "Enough is not a bad oceanarium, of course less than in St. Petersburg or MSC. The only thing ... it seemed that the glasses in large aquariums are poorly cleaned from the inside, it\u2019s unclear\n\n",
          "I would not say that Ohhhh, but the children will be interested.\n\nThe most I liked was the long corridor and the fish above you\n\n",
          "The kids really liked it. And for myself there were discoveries.\nA huge minus is that when you exit you get into the street. Ie you can not leave the outerwear if it is cold or rain. Forced to carry her with you. And \u2026",
          "Handsomely. Interesting. You can visit several times.\n\n",
          "It\u2019s interesting for the children .... a chic underwater tunnel ... The queue at the cash desk .... but there is an option ... if you walk 100 meters forward between the houses, go to the street-market and walk almost \u2026",
          "For the aquarium, located next to the sea, very modest. A lot of people at the box office, near the aquariums, for 3k.\nThe only thing I liked was the painted walls in ultraviolet)\n I also want to note the deplorable \u2026",
          "There are very few expositions, like all Sochi stupid fundraising. 800 r per shark is a mockery. Super aquarium in Vladivostok costs the same money\n\n",
          "Were in November. The people are not very many. Children cost 300, adult 500. We spent about 30 minutes on everything. We liked the tunnel very much, in the form of an arch. You go, and on both sides and above your \u2026",
          "Well, personally, I did not really like it! Well, as they say, there are no friends in the taste and color.\n\n",

          "Compared with Moscow, it seemed less, and once it\u2019s worth going, it will be especially interesting for children.\n\n",
          "A very beautiful show program, but it takes place at certain times\n\n",
          "Place to explore the fish. There is entertainment for both children and adults - feeding fish. If a lot of money - you can feed the fish in scuba under water. With parking there are difficulties.\n\n",
          "I liked everything very much .... The only thing is to add electronic terminals for buying tickets. Two ticket offices can not cope with such a mass of people who want to buy a ticket.\n\n",
          "A good aquarium, but if you go with a jaunty child, you will quickly reach the end))) Carps and their feeding (you can buy food in the machine) and the underwater tunnel with sharks and other fish turned out to be the \u2026",
          "He takes 3rd place in Russia, I really liked the transparent glass tunnel.\n\n",
          "A small oceanarium in Sochi. There are aquariums with tropical fish, sturgeon, sharks, a tiny terrarium with turtles. The size of the exposure is small, you can go around in an hour. The most spectacular is the \u2026",
          "Not a bad aquarium. Beautiful program with a scuba diver. You can feed the fish. Want bigger.\n\n",
          "Everything cool. The abundance of aquariums, each description of the fish. You can feed the fish in the pond. They are accustomed, float to everyone. Underwater tunnel, sharks, turtles, stingrays ....\n\n",
          "Very impressed with the oceanarium! Large, bright, a lot of marine inhabitants, long tunnels, mermaids. In general, I recommend!\n\n",
          "A lot of people are all pushed and run somewhere. Parking no car attach is very difficult. It is better to buy tickets from the grandmother to the will of dentistry. a huge queue\n\n",
          "Visited this aquarium while being on vacation in the city of Sochi! Was frankly disappointed from this place. The location is not very convenient, we had to walk a lot from the parking lot due to the remoteness. I had \u2026",
          "Many different fish, an interesting tunnel. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s always or not, but before us a mermaid swam, waved her hands at children and sent kisses.\n\n",
          "Not worth the money! I have something to compare! For tickets, people are an hour and a half, despite the fact that the ticket can be bought on the way from the stop to the aquarium, from distributors for the same \u2026",
          "Located in Adler, I liked everything very much, affordable prices, did not regret visiting, it was very beautiful, like in a fairy tale, under water!\n\n",

          "There have already been several times, the child is delighted with the fish. Very filled aquarium. You can feed the fish\n\n",
          "Admission ticket 800 rubles. For large discounts there. They paid 3100 rubles for a family of two adults and three children. And if you go with a guide, you need another 50 rubles. for each lay out. It is not worth \u2026",
          "Interesting fish, many different aquariums. Over 50 p. in the machine you can buy special food for fish and feed them.\n\n",
          "There were a lot of visitors, apparently did not expect this, did not cope well, the organization was lame. And I would like more friendly staff.\n\n",
          "The oceanarium in Adler is the largest not only in Sochi, but also in the south of Russia. Admission by ticket, cost from 400 to 800 rubles. We walked around the halls of the oceanarium for 4 hours and were amazed by \u2026",
          "In January 2019, the entrance cost 800\u20bd for adults. Children under 4 years free.\nAt the entrance there is a machine with a food for fish on 50\u20bd. You can feed the fish in the outdoor pool.\nStaff Pts friendly, even the \u2026",
          "This is not an aquarium, but ... discarded money. There are no benefits, there\u2019s nothing to watch either. If you have ever been to any aquarium, then do not go, do not waste money.\n\n",
          "Very good cozy fish a lot\n\n",
          "The place is wonderful. Recommended to visit. There is a slight feeling of overpricing (800 adults, 500 children), which is compensated if you get to feed the fish and show mermaids.\nWithout the above measures, the \u2026",
          "Quite interesting, especially the first time. It is not very big, but neat. Kids will like it.\n\n",

          "The child was delighted!\nAnd adults too.\nBut it is worth visiting on a weekday \u2014 when many people consider everything to fail.\n\n",
          "Nice aquarium, but 800 rubles. a little expensive. You can feed the carp for 50r\n\n",
          "Too small aquarium. You can slowly go for 20 minutes. But they hold a show there - feeding turtles and mermaids. If you go without a show, the aquarium is not worth the money.\n\n",

        "wiki": "Sochi (Russian: \u0421\u043e\u0301\u0447\u0438, IPA: [\u02c8sot\u0255\u026a] (listen)) is a city in Krasnodar Krai. It is located in Western Russia, on the Black Sea coast near Russia's southern border. The Greater Sochi area, which includes territories and localities subordinated to Sochi proper, has a total area of 3,526 square kilometers (1,361 sq mi) and sprawls for 145 kilometers (90 mi) along the shores of the Black Sea near the Caucasus Mountains. The area of the city proper is 176.77 square kilometers (68.25 sq mi). According to the 2010 Census, the city had a permanent population of 343,334, up from 328,809 recorded in the 2002 Census, making it Russia's largest resort city. Being part of the Caucasian Riviera, it is one of the very few places in Russia with a subtropical climate, with warm to hot summers and mild winters.\nWith the alpine and Nordic events held at the nearby ski resort of Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi hosted the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, as well as the Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix from 2014 until at least 2020. It was also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore the whole area was conquered by Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian invaders, the Zygii people lived in Lesser Abkhazia under the Kingdom of Pontus, then the Roman Empire's influence in antiquity. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of Lazica and Abkhazia, who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was unified under the single Georgian monarchy in 11th-century, forming one of the Saeristavo, known as Tskhumi extending its possessions up to Nicopsis. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading Alans, Khazars, Mongols and other nomadic empires whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century Byzantine basilica still stands in the Loo Microdistrict.From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi known as Ubykhia was part of historical Circassia, and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, which was their principal trading partner in the Muslim world.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nThe coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Caucasian War and the Russo-Turkish War, 1828\u20131829; however, the Circassians did not admit the Russian control over Circassia and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the Circassian coast (Adyghe: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044b \u0430\u0443\u0448\u0443). Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the Russian Empire and the British Empire that occurred in 1836 over the mission of the Vixen.The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron Feodor Tornau investigated the coastal route from Gelendzhik to Gagra, and across the mountains to Kabarda, in the 1830s. In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the Sochi River as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky in order to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on Cape Adler soon after.\nThe last battle of the Caucasian War took place at the Godlikh river on March 18, 1864 O.S., where the Ubykhs were defeated by the Dakhovsky regiment of the Russian Army. On March 25, 1864, the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of Caucasian War was proclaimed at Kbaade tract (modern Krasnaya Polyana) on June 2 (21 May O.S.), 1864, by the manifesto of Emperor Alexander II read aloud by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia.After the end of Caucasian War (during the period of 1864\u20131870) almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the Shapsugs, who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed in the Circassian Genocide or expelled to the Ottoman Empire (see Circassian Genocide). Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia.In 1874\u20131891, the first Russian Orthodox church, St. Michael's Church, was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed Dakhovsky Posad on April 13, 1874 (O.S.). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky Posad was renamed Sochi Posad (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed Black Sea Governorate. In 1900\u20131910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, \"Kavkazskaya Riviera\", opened on June 14, 1909 (O.S.). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Soviet time ===\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the littoral area saw sporadic armed clashes involving the Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev's Constructivist Institute of Rheumatology (1927\u20131931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Modern Russia ===\nFollowing Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimean Peninsula (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a Greater Sochi which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGreater Sochi is elongated along the Black Sea coast for 145 kilometers (90 mi). Sochi is approximately 1,603 kilometers (996 mi) from Moscow.The city of Sochi borders with Tuapsinsky District in the northwest, with Apsheronsky District and with Maykopsky District of the Republic of Adygea in the north, with Mostovsky District in the northeast, and with Georgia/Abkhazia in the southeast. From the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea.\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are Lazarevskoye, Loo, Dagomys, central Sochi (Tsentralny City District), Khosta, Matsesta, and Adler. The whole city is located on the slopes of the Western Caucasus which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the Mzymta, which is in fact the longest Black Sea tributary in Russia, and the Shakhe. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the Sochi, the Khosta, and the Matsesta.

Almost the whole area of the Greater Sochi, with the exception of the coast and of the area which belong to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, are included into Sochi National Park.\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters (average 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from December to March and warm summers (average 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) during the day and 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from May to October.\n\n\n=== Layout and landmarks ===\nSochi is unique among larger Russian cities as having some aspects of a subtropical resort. Apart from the scenic Caucasus Mountains, pebble and sand beaches, the city attracts vacation-goers with its subtropical vegetation, numerous parks, monuments, and extravagant Stalinist architecture. About two million people visit Greater Sochi each summer, when the city is home to the annual film festival \"Kinotavr\" and a getaway for Russia's elite.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 2,957 square kilometers (731,000 acres) Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, lies just north from the city. Sochi also has the region's most northerly tea plantations.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), at the lower elevations. Its average annual temperature is 18.4 \u00b0C (65.1 \u00b0F) during the day and 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) at night.

December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperature (of these four months) 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night. Average annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters (67 in). Sochi lies at 8b/9a hardiness zone, so the city supports different types of palm trees. Sochi is situated on the same latitude as Nice but strong cold winds from Asia make winters less warm. In fact, temperatures drop below freezing every winter. The highest temperature recorded was 39.4 \u00b0C (102.9 \u00b0F), on July 30, 2000, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221213.4 \u00b0C (7.9 \u00b0F) on January 25, 1892.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status and city divisions ==\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Krasnaya Polyana) and seventy-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Sochi\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Sochi is incorporated as Sochi Urban Okrug.Sochi is administratively subdivided into four city districts: Tsentralny City District, Lazarevsky City District, Khostinsky City District, and Adlersky City District. Tsentralny City District, comprising the central portion of, is by far the smallest out of four in terms of the area, and the other three have comparable areas, with Lazarevsky City District being the biggest. In terms of the population, Tsentralny City District is approximately twice as big as each of the other three city districts.\n\n\n=== Tsentralny City District ===\n\nTsentralny City District, or central Sochi, covers an area of 32 square kilometers (12 sq mi) and, as of the 2010 Census, has a population of 137,677. The highlights include:\n\nMichael Archangel Cathedral, a diminutive church built in 1873\u20131891 to Kaminsky's designs in order to commemorate the victorious conclusion of the Caucasian War.\nThe red-granite Archangel Column, erected in 2006 in memory of the Russian soldiers fallen in Sochi during the Caucasian War. It is capped by a 7-metre bronze statue of Sochi's patron saint, Michael the Archangel.\nSochi Art Museum occupies a large building with a four-columned portico, completed in 1939. The Neoclassical design is by Ivan Zholtovsky.\nSochi Arboretum, a large botanical garden with tropical trees from many countries, and the Mayors Alle\u00e9\u2014a landscape avenue of palm trees planted by mayors from cities around the world.\nThe Tree of Friendship, a hybrid citrus tree planted in 1934 in the Subtropical Botanic Garden. Since 1940 numerous citrus cultivars from foreign countries have been grafted onto this tree as a token of friendship and peace. The associated Friendship Tree Garden Museum has a collection of 20,000 commemorative presents from around the world.\nThe Winter Theater (1934\u20131937) is another rigorously Neoclassical edifice, surrounded by 88 Corinthian columns, with a pediment bearing the statues of Terpsichore, Melpomene and Thalia, all three cast by Vera Mukhina.\nHall of Organ and Chamber Music. Located centrally in the city of Sochi it conducts organ, symphony, chamber-ensemble, choral, vocal music concerts. All year round the Sochi Symphony Orchestra, local actors of the city art groups, famous Russian and international performers, International Contests Winners and Laureates give concerts here.\nThe Maritime Passenger Terminal (1955) is notable for its distinctive 71-meter-high steepled tower and four statues symbolizing the cardinal points.\nThe Railway Station (1952) is one of the most remarkable buildings of Sochi.\nThe Riviera Park was established by Vasily Alexeyevich Khludov in 1883 in the part of the city which later became known as Khludovskaya. The park is popular with tourists and local residents alike. It has a variety of attractions, including an outcrop of funny statues and a \"glade of friendship\" where magnolia trees were planted by every Soviet cosmonaut, among other notables.\n\n\n=== Lazarevsky City District ===\n\nLazarevsky City District lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people. It is the largest city district by area, covering some 1,744 square kilometers (673 sq mi) and comprising several microdistricts:\n\nLazarevskoye, 59 km (37 mi) from the city center, contains a delphinarium, an old church (1903), and a new church (1999). The settlement was founded as a Russian military outpost in 1839 and was named after Admiral Mikhail Lazarev.\nLoo, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, was once owned by Princes Loov, a noble Abkhazian family. The district contains the ruins of a medieval church, founded in the 8th century, rebuilt in the 11th century, and converted into a fortress in the Late Middle Ages.\nDagomys, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, has been noted for its botanical garden, established by order of Nicholas II, as well as tea plantations and factories. A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins Bocharov Ruchey, a dacha built for Kliment Voroshilov in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the President of Russia, where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.\nGolovinka is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the Ubykhs and the Shapsugs, the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the Subashi landing of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted Decembrists used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the Crimean War, so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.\nFort Godlik, of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the Khazars and revived by the Genoese in the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Khostinsky City District ===\n\nKhostinsky City District, sprawling to the southeast from the city center, occupies approximately 374 square kilometers (144 sq mi), with a population of 65,229 as of the 2010 Census. The district is traversed by many rivulets which give their names to the microdistricts of Matsesta (\"flame-colored river\"), Kudepsta, and Khosta (\"the river of boars\").\n\n\n=== Adlersky City District ===\n\nAdlersky City District, with an area of 1,352 square kilometers (522 sq mi) and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census, is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient Sadz village and a medieval Genoese trading post.\nAmong the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation from about 30,000 years ago. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages (auls), the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nAlso located here are the largest trout fishery in Russia (founded in 1964) and a breeding nursery for great apes.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%).\nThe city is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi's Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey's northeastern Black Sea coast who came in the late 19th century and on. The rest are Armenians from Georgia (particularly from Abkhazia and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Armenia (especially from Shirak Province due to the 1988 earthquake).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Sochi region in the Middle Ages. The region was relatively isolated before 1829. In the North, a few hundred Sunni Muslim Shapsugs, a part of the Circassian nation, lived around Tkhagapsh, near Lazarevskoye. The Circassians (also known as Adyghe) converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread to the region.Currently, Sochi is a large predominantly Christian city, though there are thought to be around 20,000 Muslims (5% of inhabitants) living there now (the majority are Adyghe) plus other Eastern Caucasians, Turks, Tatars, and other smaller Muslim groups.A mosque was built in 2008 by United Arab Emirates in the central area of Bytkha, in addition to the old mosque being around 40 km (25 miles) north of the city center in the Adyghe aul of Tkhagapsh.\nThere are around thirty Russian Orthodox churches, the largest being St. Michael's, and two monasteries, plus two Catholic churches, one in the center of Sochi and the other in Lazarevskoye. The Armenian community, which is important in Sochi, gathers in about ten churches.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSochi is home to the following high educational institutions (masters level degree and PhD):  Sochi State University, Russian International Innovative University, and Russian International Olympic University.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\nSochi is also known for its sport facilities: a local tennis school spawned the careers of such notable players as Grand Slam champions Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Kafelnikov spent much of his childhood here, while Sharapova relocated to Florida at the age of seven). In late 2005, the Russian Football Union announced that it was planning to establish a year-round training center for the country's national teams in Sochi. The city's warm climate was cited as one of the main incentives. Sochi is also the home for the football team PFC Sochi which plays in the Russian Premier League and for the ice hockey team HC Sochi which plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\n\n=== 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===\n\nThe nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor at Krasnaya Polyana was the location of the alpine and Nordic events for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nIn June 2006, the International Olympic Committee announced that Sochi had been selected as a finalist city to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On July 4, 2007, Sochi was announced as the host city of the 2014 Winter Games, edging out Pyeongchang, South Korea and Salzburg, Austria.This was Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The site of a training centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi saw concern and controversy following a new federal law approved in Russia in June 2013 that bans \"homosexual propaganda to minors\". There were also concerns over Islamist militants.\n\n\n==== Construction work ====\n\nThe state-controlled RAO UES announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30 billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014. The power generating companies Inter RAO UES and RusHydro would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants\u2014and the federal grid company FGC UES has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW\u2014of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. \"The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6 billion rubles (about US $3.26 billion), of which 50 billion rubles (about US$2 billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid,\" the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8 billion rubles (about US$1.9 billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38 billion roubles (about US$1.48 billion) of that.\n\n\n=== Other sports events ===\n\nThe Silk Way Rally which is part of Dakar series took place in Sochi in 2010 for the last stage between the capital of the Republic of Adygea Maykop to the city of Sochi through Pseshwap.President Vladimir Putin reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone for the city to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix from 2014.The World Robot Olympiad took place in the Adler Arena Skating Center on November 21\u201323, 2014.\nThe 2014 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen was played in Sochi in November 2014, with Carlsen emerging as the winner.\nThe Fisht Olympic Stadium was also used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches.\nSince 2014, the city has hosted HC Sochi, who play at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in the Kontinental Hockey League, the biggest ice hockey league in Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nPublic transport is represented mainly by bus and taxi. Sochi is served by the Adler-Sochi International Airport. Types of non-mass public transport include two funiculars (at the Central military sanatorium and Ordzhonikidze resort) and three cable cars (at arboretum sanatorium \"Dawn\" and pension \"Neva\") also has several cableways in Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe Sochi Port terminal building was built in 1955 by Karo Alabyan and Leonid Karlik in Stalinist architecture. It is topped with a 71-meter steepled tower. Sculptures embodying seasons and cardinal points are set above the tower's three tiers.\nFive of the railway stations of Sochi were renovated for the 2014 Winter Olympics. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta and Khosta railway stations. In Adler city district of Sochi, the original railway station was preserved and new railway station was built near it.

          "The place is in a large tourist park called the Riviera Park, it is air conditioned and pleasant, not very large. There are types of fish and animals in beautiful and rare waters, the tour is circular and the time to go through it takes about seven or eight minutes.",
          "Not worth it.",

          "A small oceanarium. It is better to visit with a complex ticket at the same time as the dolphinarium. The latter left super positive emotions.\n\n",

          "The oceanarium is more precisely only called that, in fact it is a dozen small aquariums. You can only visit in a complex ticket, I do not advise paying only for the sake of this aquarium. There is very little space, \u2026",

          "I really liked the program for both children and adults. There's nothing to do in the penguin. There are 3 pools with 4 penguins. But a contact zoo is worth a visit. There are many living rabbits everywhere. They jump \u2026",

          "A very beautiful sight! If you like to look at the fountains you will definitely like it. Water flies up, maybe twenty meters, or maybe higher, and all this with multi-colored illumination from below. Classical music \u2026",
          "A good light show, especially since it was combined with a freestyle show and with the festival of stars of Russian radio! By time, the duration of the presentation was increased. But it was possible to shift the \u2026",

          "The game of water (pump-guns), coupled with light effects, taking into account the technical progress is wonderful! The sound quality does not reach the ideal. The repertoire is normal, diverse. For a one-time visit \u2026",
          "Beautiful, but once I think, the second time I would not go. Very few shops, nowhere to sit down, the show has to be watched standing. Request to the organizers, add more fun music, all the same show.\n\n",
          "Very beautiful show, beautiful fountains, with great power raising to the incredible height of the water columns. High-quality acoustics, everything is perfectly audible in a large open space.\nIn general, it is \u2026",

          "Very interesting. Beginning in winter at 18.00\n\n",
          "The sound is disgusting in quality. And the fountains for such a large-scale and iconic place are rather weak. In the same Krasnodar, they are much cooler and prettier. And there was no Olympiad.\nSo have fun for the \u2026",

          "The scale of the construction is impressive, taking a walk with the kids is great, going around all the sites is great. Requires cosmetic repairs.\n\n",
          "For the first time, a very exciting sight. Watch definitely worth it.\n\n",
          "Very beautiful show. With transport trouble. To normally leave for Sochi, you need to wait until the break after the first separation and then stomp to the exit.\n\n",
          "Beauty is unreal. It is worth a look. A fountain that builds up to 70 m high, to classical and modern music.\n\n",
          "Very grandiose construction, sensations like on another planet. Under the well-known musical works, fountains release jets to a height of 50 meters and this is still alternated by professionally selected light lights. \u2026",
          "Beautiful, interesting, the first 10-15 minutes, then you realize that you will not see anything new - monotonous illumination and movement of fountains. I noticed that 10-15% of viewers start leaving in 15 minutes, I \u2026",

          "You should definitely look at it if you have not seen it yet. We enjoyed cycling around the Olympic Park!\n\n",
          "Cool place for evening walks! Fountains are open daily, at 8 pm. A large number of people are gathering.\n\n",

          "Like last summer is beautiful. Programs change. Go see the course is worth it. It is amazing how all this is thought out in terms of the performance itself, but more even in technical terms. Fountains are not small, \u2026",
          "In fact, nothing impressive, music plus a large equalizer from the water, and the show begins only in the late evening - the rest of the time it doesn\u2019t even look like a fountain, no water. You can come ride a scooter \u2026",
          "This huge round square, which is worth visiting and in the afternoon carefully looking at the wall with our Champions, and in the evening the color-singing performance of classical Music and Water, captivates the \u2026",

          "Fascinating, grand spectacle. The show starts at 8 pm and lasts a full hour. We watched the fountain dances to the songs of Muslim Magomayev, classical music, M. Jackson, S. Lazarev and others to the last drop. Thanks \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Bolshoy Ice Dome (Russian: \u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u041b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446) is a multi-purpose indoor arena located in Olympic Park, Sochi, Russia. Opened in 2012, the 12,000-seat arena was primarily constructed to host hockey competitions during the 2014 Winter Olympics. Following the Games, it became the home arena of HC Sochi, an expansion team of the KHL. The arena has also hosted concerts and other events. Prior to the Games, the arena hosted the IIHF World U18 Championships and Channel One Cup in 2013.\nThe arena's exterior is distinguished by its LED-illuminated roof, which its designers described as resembling faberg\u00e9 eggs and frozen water droplets\n\n\n== Name and location ==\nThe arena was named \"Bolshoy\", meaning \"big\", \"large\" and \"huge\" in Russian.  This highlights the integral role of ice hockey at the Olympics, which has been dubbed \"the most popular sport\" of the Games by the organizers themselves.  Furthermore, the name was chosen due to its universal familiarity in other countries, in addition to its allusion to the Bolshoi Theatre, Bolshoi Ballet, and other great Russian accomplishments.The Ice Dome was situated in the Coastal Cluster zone of venues for the 2014 Winter Olympics.  It served as the main arena for the men and women's ice hockey tournament throughout the Games.  It is the only venue in the Olympic Park located on top of a hill, and is less than 1,000 feet (300 m) away from Shayba Arena, which was the secondary ice hockey venue that hosted mainly preliminary round matches.\n\n\n== Structure and facilities ==\n\nThe construction of the Bolshoy Ice Dome started in 2009 and finished in 2012.  It was designed by architect firm Mostovik and completed at a cost of approximately US$180 million, although ITAR-TASS estimated the cost to be as high as $300 million.  A total of 20 architects and 70 engineers \u2013 headed by Andrey Ustinov \u2013 were responsible for the construction of the arena. The building was the only Olympic Facility to achieve BREEAM Green Certification in time for the games, achieving the prestigious \"very good\" rating.  The team to achieve this was led by Charles Goddard, Mostovik's International Certification Director.\n\nThe exterior structure of the Ice Dome was designed to resemble a frozen ice droplet.  It has also drawn comparisons to a Faberg\u00e9 egg, due to the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) resembling the \"jewel-encrusted surface\" of the famous Russian art piece.  Ustinov confirmed that the building was designed to be \"a combination of both.\"  The roof of the dome is mostly silver in colour and is covered with aluminium panels.  It is decorated with 38,000 LED lights which illuminate the outside of the arena at night.  The roof also doubles as a scoreboard that displays the live score of the game being played inside and an animation of a hockey puck whenever a goal is scored.  However, it famously did not display the final score after the United States defeated the hosts Russia 3\u20132 in an overtime shootout during the 2014 Winter Olympics.In the arena's interior, the 12,000 seats are arranged in bowl-like configuration.  The concourse features 35,000 square feet (3,300 m2) of glazed glass, which enables spectators to have a view of the Caucasus Mountains.  The hockey rink's dimensions are 60 metres (200 ft) \u00d7 30 metres (98 ft), in line with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) specifications.  This contrasts with the dimensions of the previous Olympics, which utilized National Hockey League (NHL) sized rinks that are 4 metres (13 ft) narrower in width.  It contains 12 dressing rooms for players, an entry tunnel that can be accessed by large vehicles, and a practice ice rink.  Moreover, the Ice Dome uses heat transfer fluids on the ice and in the air conditioning system.  This helps to preserve the quality of the ice, as well as moderate the temperature within the arena so that spectators are kept warm while maintaining the coolness of the ice.  These technologies \u2013 along with the arena's insulation \u2013 were developed by the Dow Chemical Company, one of the official sponsors of the Olympic Games.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\nIn order to test the arenas built for the Olympics, the Bolshoy Ice Dome served as one of the venues for the 2013 IIHF World U18 Championships.  It subsequently held the Channel One Cup from 19\u201322 December 2013 in final preparation before the start of the Games.  As the main venue for the 2014 Olympic ice hockey competition, the Ice Dome hosted most of the preliminary round games and almost all the playoff round matches for the men's tournament, while hosting solely the medal matches of the women's tournament.  On February 20, it held the gold medal match for the women's tournament, which saw Canada overcome a 0\u20132 deficit against the United States to tie the game with less than a minute of regulation time remaining, before scoring in overtime to secure their fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal.  The arena hosted the gold medal game of the men's tournament three days later on 23 February \u2013 the final gold medal of the 2014 Games up for contention \u2013 in which Canada defeated Sweden by a score of 3\u20130.  In doing so, the Canadian team won an Olympic gold medal outside of North America for the first time in 62 years, became the first team since the Soviet Union in 1984 to finish the tournament with a perfect record, the first team to successfully defend their gold medal since the Soviets in 1988, and the first to do both with the participation of NHL players, which started in 1998.The venue hosted the 2015 Kontinental Hockey League All-Star Game. The arena also hosted the first edition of the VTB United Basketball League All-Star Game.\n\n\n== After the Olympics ==\nAfter the conclusion of the Olympics, the arena continue to host a variety of sports, in addition to becoming an entertainment centre and concert venue.  The arena now hosts HC Sochi, a KHL expansion team.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIce Dome Bolshoy General information and images\nBolshoy ice dome lights up sochi 2014 winter olympicsInformation and images\nBig Ice Hockey Arena Information and images\nVenue Models from Sochi Investment Forum 2009\nArena information and drawings\nArena information",

        "wiki": "The 2014 Winter Olympics, officially called the XXII Olympic Winter Games (French: Les XXIIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver) (Russian: XXII \u041e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, tr. XXII Olimpiyskiye zimniye igry) and commonly known as Sochi 2014, was an international winter multi-sport event that was held from 7 to 23 February 2014 in Sochi, Krasnodar Krai, Russia, with opening rounds in certain events held on the eve of the opening ceremony, 6 February 2014.\nBoth the Olympics and 2014 Winter Paralympics were organized by the Sochi Organizing Committee (SOOC). Sochi was selected as the host city in July 2007, during the 119th IOC Session held in Guatemala City. It was the first Olympics to be held in a CIS state since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Soviet Union was previously the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. These were the first Olympic Games under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.\nA record 98 events in fifteen winter sport disciplines were held during the Games. A number of new competitions\u2014a total of twelve accounting for gender\u2014were held during the Games, including biathlon mixed relay, women's ski jumping, mixed-team figure skating, mixed-team luge, half-pipe skiing, ski and snowboard slopestyle, and snowboard parallel slalom. The events were held around two clusters of new venues: an Olympic Park constructed in Sochi's Imeretinsky Valley on the coast of the Black Sea, with Fisht Olympic Stadium, and the Games' indoor venues located within walking distance, and snow events in the resort settlement of Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe 2014 Winter Olympics were the most expensive Games in the history of the Olympics. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, major cost overruns, caused this figure to expand to US$51 billion, more than three times the cost of the 2012 London Olympics and even surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The 2014 Games achieved a record broadcast audience of 2.1 billion people worldwide.In 2016, an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed allegations that the Russian Olympic team had been involved in a state-sponsored doping program, active from at least late-2011 through August 2015. The program was active during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and athletes had benefited from the cover-up. The IOC stripped thirteen medals from Russian athletes in 2017, but nine were reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, with an option for whitelisted athletes to compete independently during the 2018 Winter Olympics.\n\n\n== Bidding process ==\n\nSochi was elected on 4 July 2007 during the 119th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, defeating bids from Salzburg, Austria; and Pyeongchang, South Korea. This is the first time that the Russian Federation has hosted the Winter Olympics. The Soviet Union was the host of the 1980 Summer Olympics held in and around Moscow.\n\n\n== Cost and financing ==\n\nAs of October 2013, the estimated combined cost of the 2014 Winter Olympics had topped US$51 billion. This amount included the cost for Olympic games themselves and cost of Sochi infrastructural projects (roads, railroads, power plants). This total is over four times the initial budget of $12 billion (compared to the $8 billion spent for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), and made the Sochi games the most expensive Olympics in history, exceeding the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, which hosted 3 times as many events.  Dmitry Kozak was the main overseer for the events in Sochi.In its final budget published in June 2014, Olimpstroy\u2014the state corporation that oversaw the Sochi Olympics development\u2014reported the total allocated funds for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics of 1,524 billion rubles (US$49.5 billion). However, only about a fifth of that budget ($10.8 billion) was directly related to the Olympic games, while the rest went into urban and regional regeneration and the conversion of the Sochi region into an all-year round sea and alpine resort. The breakdown table below is based on a report that has analyzed the distribution of Olimpstroy's $49.5 billion budget. Estimates also suggest that additional unrecoverable operational costs (including for security) could have added another $3 billion.\n\n\n=== The breakdown of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics costs ===\n\n\n== Venues ==\n\nWith an average February temperature of 8.3 \u00b0C (42.8 \u00b0F) and a humid subtropical climate, Sochi is the warmest city to host a Winter Olympic Games. Sochi 2014 is the 12th straight Olympics to outlaw smoking; all Sochi venues, Olympic Park bars and restaurants and public areas were smoke-free during the Games. It is also the first time that an Olympic Park has been built for hosting winter games.\n\n\n=== Sochi Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster) ===\n\nThe Sochi Olympic Park was built by the Black Sea coast in the Imeretinsky Valley, about 4 km (2.5 miles) from Russia's border with Abkhazia/Georgia. The venues were clustered around a central water basin on which the Medals Plaza is built, allowing all indoor venues to be within walking distance. It also features \"The Waters of the Olympic Park\" (designed by California-based company WET), a choreographed fountain which served as the backdrop in the medals awards and the opening and closing ceremonies of the event. The new venues include:\nFisht Olympic Stadium \u2013 ceremonies (opening/closing) 40,000 spectators\nBolshoy Ice Dome \u2013 ice hockey (final), 12,000 spectators\nShayba Arena \u2013 ice hockey, 7,000 spectators\nAdler Arena Skating Center \u2013 speed skating, 8,000 spectators\nIceberg Skating Palace \u2013 figure skating, short track speed skating, 12,000 spectators\nIce Cube Curling Center \u2013 curling, 3,000 spectators\nMain Olympic village\nInternational broadcasting centre and main press room\n\n\n=== Krasnaya Polyana (Mountain Cluster) ===\n\nLaura Biathlon & Ski Complex \u2013 biathlon, cross-country skiing\nRosa Khutor Extreme Park \u2013 freestyle skiing and snowboarding\nRosa Khutor Alpine Resort \u2013 alpine skiing\nSliding Center Sanki \u2013 bobsleigh, luge and skeleton\nRusSki Gorki Jumping Center \u2013 ski jumping and Nordic combined (both ski jumping and cross-country skiing on a 2 km route around the arena)\nRoza Khutor plateau Olympic Village\n\n\n=== Post-Olympic usage ===\n\nA street circuit known as the Sochi Autodrom was constructed in and around Olympic Park. Its primary use is to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix, which held its inaugural edition in October 2014.In January 2015, work began on adapting Fisht Olympic Stadium into an open-air football stadium to host matches during the 2018 FIFA World Cup.A new ice hockey team in the Kontinental Hockey League, HC Sochi Leopards, now plays in Bolshoy Arena.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nThe Olympic infrastructure was constructed according to a Federal Target Program (FTP). In June 2009, the Games' organizers reported they were one year ahead in building the main Olympic facilities as compared to recent Olympic Games. In November 2011, IOC President Jacques Rogge was in Sochi and concluded that the city had made significant progress since he last visited eighteen months earlier.\n\n\n=== Telecommunications ===\n\nAccording to the FTP, US$580 million would be spent on construction and modernization of telecommunications in the region. Avaya was named by the Sochi Organizing Committee as the official supplier of telecommunications equipment. Avaya provided the data network equipment, including switches, routers, security, telephones and contact-center systems. It provided engineers and technicians to design and test the systems, and worked with other technology partners to provide athletes, dignitaries and fans information about the Games.The 2014 Olympics is the first \"fabric-enabled\" Games using Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) technology. The network is capable of handling up to 54,000 Gbit/s (54 Tbit/s) of traffic.Infrastructure built for the games included:\n\nA network of TETRA mobile radio communications for 100 user groups (with capacity of 10,000 subscribers);\n712 km (442 mi) of fiber-optic cables along the Anapa-Dzhubga-Sochi highways and Dzhubga\u2013Krasnodar branch;\nDigital broadcasting infrastructure, including radio and television broadcasting stations (building and communications towers) with coverage from Grushevaya Polyana (Pear Glade) to Sochi and Anapa cities. The project also included construction of infocommunications centre for broadcasting abroad via three HDTV satellites.During the Games, the core networks of Rostelecom and Transtelekom were used.In January 2012, the newest equipment for the television coverage of the Games arrived in the port of Adler. Prepared specifically for the Games, a team of regional specialists and the latest technology provide a qualitatively new level of television production in the region.The fiber-optic channel links Sochi between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana. The 46-kilometre-long (29 mi) channel enables videoconferencing and news reporting from the Olympics.In November 2013, it was reported that the fiber-optic cable that was built by the Federal Communications Agency, Rossvyaz, had no operator. With Rostelecom and Megafon both refusing to operate it, the line was transferred to the ownership of the state enterprise Center for Monitoring & Development of Infocommunication Technologies (Russian: \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u041c\u0418\u0420 \u0418\u0422).Russian mobile phone operator Megafon expanded and improved Sochi's telecom infrastructure with over 700 new 2G/3G/4G cell towers. Sochi was the first Games to offer 4G connectivity at a speed of 10 MB/sec.\nIn January 2014, Rostelecom reported that it had connected the Olympic media center in Sochi to the Internet and organized channels of communication with the main media center of the Olympic Games in the coastal cluster and press center in Moscow. The media center was built at total cost of 17 million rubles.\n\n\n=== Power infrastructure ===\n\nA five-year strategy for increasing the power supply of the Sochi region was presented by Russian energy experts during a seminar on 29 May 2009, held by the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee, and attended by International Olympic Committee (IOC) experts and officials from the Russian Ministry of Regional Development, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the State Corporation Olimpstroy and the Krasnodar Krai administration.According to the strategy, the capacity of the regional energy network would increase by two and a half times by 2014, guaranteeing a stable power supply during and after the Games.\nThe power demand of Sochi at the end of May 2009 was 424 MW. The power demand of the Olympic infrastructure was expected to be about 340 MW.\n\nPoselkovaya electrical substation became operational in early 2009.\nSochi thermal power station reconstructed (expected power output was 160 MW)\nLaura and Rosa Khutor electrical substations were completed in November 2010\nMzymta electrical substation was completed in March 2011\nKrasnopolyanskaya hydroelectric power station was completed in 2010\nAdler CHP station design and construction was completed in 2012. Expected power output was 360 MW\nBytkha substation, under construction with two transformers 25 MW each, includes dependable microprocessor-based protectionEarlier plans also include building combined cycle (steam and gas) power stations near the cities of Tuapse and Novorossiysk and construction of a cable-wire powerline, partially on the floor of the Black Sea.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nThe transport infrastructure prepared to support the Olympics includes many roads, tunnels, bridges, interchanges, railroads and stations in and around Sochi. Among others, 8 flyovers, 102 bridges, tens of tunnels and a bypass route for heavy trucks \u2014 367 km (228 miles) of roads were paved.The Sochi Light Metro is located between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana connecting the Olympic Park, Sochi International Airport, and the venues in Krasnaya Polyana.\n \nThe existing 102 km (63-mile), Tuapse-to-Adler railroad was renovated to provide double track throughout, increasing capacity and enabling a reliable regional service to be provided and extending to the airport. In December 2009, Russian Railways ordered 38 Siemens Mobility Desiro trains for delivery in 2013 for use during the Olympics, with an option for a further 16 partly built in Russia. Russian Railways established a high-speed Moscow-Adler link and a new railroad (more than 60 kilometres or 37 miles long) passing by the territory of Ukraine.\nAt Sochi International Airport, a new terminal was built along a 3.5 km (2.2-mile) runway extension, overlapping the Mzymta River. Backup airports were built in Gelendzhik, Mineralnye Vody and Krasnodar by 2009.\n\nAt the Port of Sochi, a new offshore terminal 1.5 km (0.93 mi) from the shore allows docking for cruise ships with capacities of 3,000 passengers. The cargo terminal of the seaport would be moved from the centre of Sochi.\nRoadways were detoured, some going around the construction site and others being cut off.\n\nIn May 2009, Russian Railways started the construction of tunnel complex No. 1 (the final total is six) on the combined road (automobile and railway) from Adler to Alpica Service Mountain Resort in the Krasnaya Polyana region. The tunnel complex No. 1 is located near Akhshtyr in Adlersky City District, and includes:\nEscape tunnel, 2.25 kilometres (1.40 mi), completed in 2010\nRoad tunnel, 2,153 metres (7,064 ft), completed in 2013\nOne-track railway tunnel, 2,473 metres (8,114 ft), completed in 2013Russian Railways president Vladimir Yakunin stated the road construction costed more than 200 billion rubles.In addition, Sochi's railway stations were renovated. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta, Khosta, Lazarevskaya, and Loo railway stations. In Adler, a new railway station was built while the original building was preserved, and in the Olympic park cluster, a new station was built from scratch, the Olympic Park railway station. Another new railway station was built in Estosadok, close to Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\n=== Other infrastructure ===\n\nFunds were spent on the construction of hotels for 10,300 guests. The first of the Olympic hotels, Zvezdny (Stellar), was rebuilt anew. Significant funds were spent on the construction of an advanced sewage treatment system in Sochi, designed by Olimpstroy. The system meets BREF standards and employs top available technologies for environment protection, including tertiary treatment with microfiltration.Six post offices were opened at competition venues, two of them in the main media centre in Olympic Park and in the mountain village of Estosadok. In addition to standard services, customers had access to unique services including two new products, Fotomarka and Retropismo. Fotomarka presents an opportunity to get a stylized sheet of eight souvenir stamps with one's own photos, using the services of a photographer in the office. Retropismo service allows a customer to write with their own stylus or pen on antique paper with further letters, winding string and wax seal affixing. All the new sites and post offices in Sochi were opened during the Olympics until late night 7 days a week, and employees were trained to speak English.\n\n\n== The Games ==\n\n\n=== Torch relay ===\n\nOn 29 September 2013, the Olympic torch was lit in Ancient Olympia, beginning a seven-day journey across Greece and on to Russia, then the torch relay started at Moscow on 7 October 2013 before passing 83 Russian cities and arriving at Sochi on the day of the opening ceremony, 7 February 2014. It is the longest torch relay in Olympic history, a 60,000-kilometre (40,000 miles) route that passes through all regions of the country, from Kaliningrad in the west to Chukotka in the east.\nThe Olympic torch reached the North Pole for first time via a nuclear-powered icebreaker (50 Let Pobedy). The torch was also passed for the first time in space, though not lit for the duration of the flight for safety reasons, on flight Soyuz TMA-11M to the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft itself was adorned with Olympic-themed livery including the Games' emblem. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky waved the torch on a spacewalk outside ISS. The torch returned to Earth five days later on board Soyuz TMA-09M. The torch also reached Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, and Siberia's Lake Baikal.\n\n\n=== Opening ceremony ===\n\nThe opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held on 7 February 2014 at Fisht Olympic Stadium, an indoor arena built specifically for the ceremonies. The ceremony featured scenes based around aspects of Russian history and arts, including ballet, classical music, the Russian Revolution, and the age of the Soviet Union. The opening scene of the ceremony featured a notable technical error, where one of five snowflakes, which were to expand to form the Olympic rings, malfunctioned and did not expand (a mishap mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings \"failed\" to expand). The torch was taken into the stadium by Maria Sharapova, who then passed it to Yelena Isinbayeva who, in turn, passed it to wrestler Aleksandr Karelin. Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Figure skater Irina Rodnina took the torch and was met by former ice hockey goalkeeper Vladislav Tretiak, who exited the stadium to jointly light the Olympic cauldron located near the center of Olympic Park.\n\n\n=== Participating National Olympic Committees ===\nA record 88 nations qualified to compete, which beat the previous record of 82 set at the previous Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Seven nations made their Winter Olympics debut: Dominica, Malta, Paraguay, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, and Zimbabwe.Kristina Krone qualified to compete in her second consecutive games for Puerto Rico, but the island's Olympic Committee once again chose not to send her to compete. Similarly, South Africa decided not to send alpine skier Sive Speelman to Sochi. Algeria also did not enter its only qualified athlete, Mehdi-Selim Khelifi.India's athletes originally competed as Independent Olympic Participants and marched under the Olympic flag during the opening ceremony, as India was originally suspended in December 2012 over the election process of the Indian Olympic Association. On 11 February, the Indian Olympic Association was reinstated and India's athletes were allowed the option to compete under their own flag from that time onward. Although Shiva Keshavan competed as an Independent athlete and is recorded as such, he was permitted to walk under the flag of India at the Closing Ceremony.\n\n\n==== National houses ====\nDuring the Games some countries had a national house, a meeting place for supporters, athletes and other followers. Houses can be either free for visitors to access or they can have limited access by invitation only.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe 2014 Winter Olympics featured 98 events over 15 disciplines in 7 sports. A total of twelve new events were contested, making it the largest Winter Olympics to date.\n\nNumbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.\n\n\n==== New events ====\n\nOn 6 April 2011, the IOC accepted a number of events that were submitted by their respective sports federations to be considered for inclusion into the official program of these Olympic Games.\nThe events included a Figure skating team event, Women's ski jumping, Mixed relay biathlon, Ski half-pipe, and Team relay luge.\nOn 4 July 2011, the IOC announced that three events would be added to the program. These events, which were officially declared by Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge on 5 July 2011, were:\n\nSki slopestyle\nSnowboard slopestyle\nSnowboard parallel special slalomTeam alpine skiing was also presented as a candidate for inclusion in the Olympic program but the Executive board of the IOC rejected this proposal. The International Ski Federation persisted with the nomination and this was considered. There were reports of bandy possibly being added to the sports program, but the IOC rejected this request. Subsequently, the international governing body, Federation of International Bandy, decided that Irkutsk and Shelekhov in Russia would host the 2014 Bandy World Championship just before the Olympics.\nOn 28 November 2006, the Executive Board of the IOC decided not to include Ski mountaineering, Ski-orienteering, or Winter triathlon in the review process of the program.\n\n\n=== Closing ceremony ===\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 23 February 2014 between 20:14 MSK (UTC+4) and 22:25 MSK (UTC+4) at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi.\nThe ceremony was dedicated to Russian culture featuring world-renowned Russian stars like conductor and violinist Yuri Bashmet, conductor Valery Gergiev, pianist Denis Matsuev, singer Hibla Gerzmava and violinist Tatiana Samouil. These artists were joined by performers from the Bolshoi and Mariinsky theaters.\n\n\n== Medals ==\n\nSochi's medal design was unveiled in May 2013. The design is intended to resemble Sochi's landscape, with a semi-translucent section containing a \"patchwork quilt\" of diamonds representing mountains; the diamonds themselves contain designs that reflect Russia's regions. Those who won gold medals on 15 February received special medals with fragments of the Chelyabinsk meteor, marking the one-year anniversary of the event where pieces of the cosmic body fell into the Chebarkul Lake in the Ural Mountains in central Russia.\n\n\n=== Medal table ===\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by number of gold medals are listed below. The host nation, Russia, is highlighted.\nTo sort this table by nation, total medal count, or any other column, click on the  icon next to the column title.\n\n  *   Host nation (Russia)\n\n\n=== Podium sweeps ===\na  Legkov and Vylegzhanin were initially disqualified by the IOC for doping offenses in November 2017, and their 2014 Olympic medals were stripped (gold and silver respectively). However, their results were restored on 1 February 2018 following a successful appeal.\n\n\n== Calendar ==\n\nIn the following calendar each blue box represents one or more event competition(s), such as a qualification round, on that day. The yellow boxes represent medal-awarding finals for a sport with in each box the number of finals that were contested on that day.\nAll dates are MSK (UTC+4)\n\n\n== Security ==\n\n\n=== Measures ===\nSecurity during both the Olympics and Paralympics were handled by over 40,000 law enforcement officials, including police and the Russian Armed Forces. A Presidential Decree signed by President Vladimir Putin took effect on 7 January, requiring that any protests and demonstrations in Sochi and the surrounding area through 21 March (the end of the Paralympics) be approved by the Federal Security Service. For the duration of the decree, travel restrictions were also in effect in and around Sochi: \"controlled\" zones, dubbed the \"ring of steel\" by the media, covered the Coastal and Mountain clusters which encompass all of the Games' venues and infrastructure, including transport hubs such as railway stations. To enter controlled areas, visitors were required to pass through security checkpoints with x-ray machines, metal detectors and explosive material scanners. Several areas were designated as \"forbidden\", including Sochi National Park and the border with Abkhazia. An unmanned aerial vehicle squadron, along with S-400 and Pantsir-S1 air defense rockets were used to protect Olympic airspace. Four gunboats were also deployed on the Black Sea to protect the coastline.A number of security organizations and forces began stationing in and around Sochi in January 2014; Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) was stationed in Sochi for the Games beginning on 7 January 2014. A group of 10,000 Internal Troops of the Ministry of Interior also provided security services during the Games. In mid-January, 1,500 Siberian Regional Command troops were stationed in a military town near Krasnaya Polyana. A group of 400 cossacks in traditional uniforms were also present to accompany police patrols. The 58th Army unit of the Russian Armed Forces, were defending the Georgia-Russia border. The United States also supplied Navy ships and other assets for security purposes.All communication and Internet traffic by Sochi residents was captured and filtered through deep packet inspection systems at all mobile networks using the SORM system.Former professional speed skater and current deputy of the Russian State Duma Svetlana Zhurova has stated that the 2014 Sochi Olympics were Vladimir Putin's personal project to showcase Russia to the world.\n\n\n=== Incidents and threats ===\nOrganizers received several threats prior to the Games. In a July 2013 video release, Chechen Islamist commander Dokka Umarov called for attacks on the Games, stating that the Games were being staged \"on the bones of many, many Muslims killed ...and buried on our lands extending to the Red Sea.\"Threats were received from the group Vilayat Dagestan, which had claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings under the demands of Umarov, and a number of National Olympic Committees had also received threats via e-mail, threatening that terrorists would kidnap or \"blow up\" athletes during the Games. However, while the IOC did state that the letters \"[contained] no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public\", the U.S. ski and snowboarding teams hired a private security agency to provide additional protection during the Games.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting rights ===\n\nIn most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics were packaged together with broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well. Domestic broadcast rights were sold by Sportfive to a consortium of three Russian broadcasters; Channel One, VGTRK, and NTV Plus.In the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a new, US$4.38 billion contract with NBCUniversal, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020.In Canada, after losing the 2010 and 2012 Games to Bell Media and Rogers Media, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation re-gained broadcast rights to the Olympics for the first time since 2008, gaining rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games. Bell and Rogers sub-licensed pay-TV rights for their TSN, Sportsnet and R\u00e9seau des sports networks, as well as TVA Group's TVA Sports.In Australia, after all three major commercial networks pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Games due to cost concerns, the IOC awarded broadcast rights to just the 2014 Winter Olympics to Network Ten for A$20 million.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nSeveral broadcasters used the Games to trial the emerging ultra high definition television (UHDTV) standard. Both NTV Plus and Comcast filmed portions of the Games in 4K resolution; Comcast offered its content through smart TV apps, while NTV+ held public and cinema viewings of the content. NHK filmed portions of the Games in 8K resolution for public viewing. Olympic sponsor Panasonic filmed the opening ceremony in 4K.\n\n\n== Concerns and controversies ==\n\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or Russia's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities. Concerns were shown over Russia's policies surrounding the LGBT community, including the government's denial of a proposed Pride House for the Games on moral grounds, and a federal law passed in June 2013 which criminalized the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms.\n\nSome Circassian organizations objected to the Games being held on land their ancestors held until 1864, when most of them were vanquished at the end of the Russian-Circassian War (1763\u20131864), in what they consider to be ethnic cleansing or genocide. The use of Krasnaya Polyana (\"Red Hill\" or \"Red Glade\") as an event site was considered sensitive, as it was named for a group of Circassians who were defeated in a bloody battle with Russians while attempting to return home over it in 1864. Some Circassian groups demanded that the Games be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for their actions. Other groups did not outright object to the Games, but suggested that symbols of Circassian history and culture be incorporated into the Games, as Australia, the United States and Canada did for their indigenous cultures in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.\nU.S. broadcaster NBC largely avoided broadcasting material critical of Russia, although several segments deemed \"overly friendly to Russia\" were criticized by some commentators. However, following the closing ceremony, commentators evaluated the Games to have been successful overall.\n\n\n=== Russian doping scandal ===\n\nFollowing the Games, reports began to emerge that the Russian Olympic team had participated in a state-run doping program, which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. These allegations first emerged in a December 2014 documentary by German public broadcaster ARD, and were detailed further in a May 2016 report by The New York Times\u2014which published allegations by Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov alleged that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games. Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won in Sochi were the result of doping.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) commissioned an independent report by Richard McLaren, which corroborated claims that Russian authorities had been discreetly swapping out urine samples that tested positive for performance-enhancing substances. The report concluded that the program had been operating from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\", and had covered up 643 positive samples across Olympic and non-Olympic sports. As a result, WADA considered the Russian Anti-Doping Agency to be non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.Russia was not banned from the 2016 Olympics by the IOC, the decision that was widely criticized by both athletes and writers; the IOC only required Russia's athletes to be cleared by an internal panel and their respective sports federations. The IAAF had suspended Russia from international track and field events due to the scandal, but did allow Darya Klishina to participate in the Olympics because she was confirmed not to be a part of a doping program. The International Paralympic Committee suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee and banned the team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics.On 5 December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, thus banning it from sending athletes under the Russian flag to the 2018 Winter Olympics. Cleared Russian athletes were allowed to participate as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR). Two of them, curler Alexander Krushelnitskiy, who won a bronze medal, and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva, failed drug tests during the Games.\nThe IOC's Oswald Commission disqualified and banned 43 Russian athletes, and stripped thirteen medals they earned in Sochi. On 1 February 2018, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) found that the IOC provided insufficient evidence for 28 athletes, and overturned their IOC sanctions. For 11 other athletes, the CAS decided that there was sufficient evidence to uphold their Sochi sanctions, but reduced their lifetime bans to only the 2018 Winter Olympics. The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the [2018 Winter Olympic] Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\u201d and that \u201cthis [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\u201d. The IOC found it important to note that the CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\u201d and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. Later that month, the Russian Olympic Committee was reinstated by the IOC, despite failed doping tests during the 2018 Olympics, and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency was re-certified in September, despite the Russian officials not accepting the McLaren report.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n2014 Winter Paralympics\n2014 Summer Youth Olympics\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Sochi 2014\".

The presence of mineral springs, attractive coastal and mountain scenery, long beaches, and warm (humid subtropical) climate have made Sochi a large and popular holiday and health resort for Russian vacationers. Sochi has dozens of hotels, tourist centres, and campsites and more than 50 sanatoriums. The primary industry is food processing, though few of the city\u2019s workers are employed in industry. Sochi\u2019s streets and gardens are filled with exotic subtropical trees and shrubs. Greater Sochi, created in 1961, includes resorts stretching for some 90 miles (150 km) along the coast.Kavkazsky Nature Reserve, established in 1924 and occupying 1,017 square miles (2,633 square km), lies approximately 45 miles (72 km) northeast of the city. A major recreation site of the Russian government is located northwest along the Black Sea coast at nearby Dagomys. The city hosted the 2014 Olympic Winter Games, for which sports and lodging venues were constructed in the city and in the Krasnaya Polyana mountain area of the Caucasus to the east of Sochi. Pop.

It is located in Western Russia, on the Black Sea coast near Russia's southern border. The Greater Sochi area, which includes territories and localities subordinated to Sochi proper, has a total area of 3,526 square kilometers (1,361 sq mi) and sprawls for 145 kilometers (90 mi) along the shores of the Black Sea near the Caucasus Mountains. The area of the city proper is 176.77 square kilometers (68.25 sq mi). According to the 2010 Census, the city had a permanent population of 343,334, up from 328,809 recorded in the 2002 Census, making it Russia's largest resort city. Being part of the Caucasian Riviera, it is one of the very few places in Russia with a subtropical climate, with warm to hot summers and mild winters.\nWith the alpine and Nordic events held at the nearby ski resort of Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi hosted the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, as well as the Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix from 2014 until at least 2020. It was also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore the whole area was conquered by Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian invaders, the Zygii people lived in Lesser Abkhazia under the Kingdom of Pontus, then the Roman Empire's influence in antiquity. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of Lazica and Abkhazia, who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was unified under the single Georgian monarchy in 11th-century, forming one of the Saeristavo, known as Tskhumi extending its possessions up to Nicopsis. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading Alans, Khazars, Mongols and other nomadic empires whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century Byzantine basilica still stands in the Loo Microdistrict.From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi known as Ubykhia was part of historical Circassia, and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, which was their principal trading partner in the Muslim world.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nThe coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Caucasian War and the Russo-Turkish War, 1828\u20131829; however, the Circassians did not admit the Russian control over Circassia and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the Circassian coast (Adyghe: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044b \u0430\u0443\u0448\u0443). Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the Russian Empire and the British Empire that occurred in 1836 over the mission of the Vixen.The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron Feodor Tornau investigated the coastal route from Gelendzhik to Gagra, and across the mountains to Kabarda, in the 1830s. In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the Sochi River as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky in order to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on Cape Adler soon after.\nThe last battle of the Caucasian War took place at the Godlikh river on March 18, 1864 O.S., where the Ubykhs were defeated by the Dakhovsky regiment of the Russian Army. On March 25, 1864, the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of Caucasian War was proclaimed at Kbaade tract (modern Krasnaya Polyana) on June 2 (21 May O.S.), 1864, by the manifesto of Emperor Alexander II read aloud by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia.After the end of Caucasian War (during the period of 1864\u20131870) almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the Shapsugs, who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed in the Circassian Genocide or expelled to the Ottoman Empire (see Circassian Genocide). Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia.In 1874\u20131891, the first Russian Orthodox church, St. Michael's Church, was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed Dakhovsky Posad on April 13, 1874 (O.S.). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky Posad was renamed Sochi Posad (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed Black Sea Governorate. In 1900\u20131910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, \"Kavkazskaya Riviera\", opened on June 14, 1909 (O.S.). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Soviet time ===\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the littoral area saw sporadic armed clashes involving the Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev's Constructivist Institute of Rheumatology (1927\u20131931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Modern Russia ===\nFollowing Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimean Peninsula (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a Greater Sochi which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGreater Sochi is elongated along the Black Sea coast for 145 kilometers (90 mi). Sochi is approximately 1,603 kilometers (996 mi) from Moscow.The city of Sochi borders with Tuapsinsky District in the northwest, with Apsheronsky District and with Maykopsky District of the Republic of Adygea in the north, with Mostovsky District in the northeast, and with Georgia/Abkhazia in the southeast. From the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea.\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are Lazarevskoye, Loo, Dagomys, central Sochi (Tsentralny City District), Khosta, Matsesta, and Adler. The whole city is located on the slopes of the Western Caucasus which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the Mzymta, which is in fact the longest Black Sea tributary in Russia, and the Shakhe. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the Sochi, the Khosta, and the Matsesta. The Psou River makes the border with Abkhazia.\nThe northeastern part of the city belongs to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve which is a World Heritage Site spanning vast areas in Krasnodar Krai and Adygea. Almost the whole area of the Greater Sochi, with the exception of the coast and of the area which belong to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, are included into Sochi National Park.\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters (average 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from December to March and warm summers (average 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) during the day and 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from May to October.\n\n\n=== Layout and landmarks ===\nSochi is unique among larger Russian cities as having some aspects of a subtropical resort. Apart from the scenic Caucasus Mountains, pebble and sand beaches, the city attracts vacation-goers with its subtropical vegetation, numerous parks, monuments, and extravagant Stalinist architecture. About two million people visit Greater Sochi each summer, when the city is home to the annual film festival \"Kinotavr\" and a getaway for Russia's elite.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 2,957 square kilometers (731,000 acres) Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, lies just north from the city. Sochi also has the region's most northerly tea plantations.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), at the lower elevations. Its average annual temperature is 18.4 \u00b0C (65.1 \u00b0F) during the day and 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) at night. In the coldest months\u2014January and February\u2014the average temperature is about 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) during the day, above 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). In the warmest months\u2014July and August\u2014the temperature typically ranges from 25 to 29 \u00b0C (77 to 84 \u00b0F) during the day, about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 23\u201324 \u00b0C (73\u201375 \u00b0F). Yearly sunshine hours are around 2,200. Generally, the summer season lasts four months, from June to September. Two months\u2014April and November\u2014are transitional; sometimes temperatures reach 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with an average temperature of around 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) during the day and 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at night. December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperature (of these four months) 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night. Average annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters (67 in). Sochi lies at 8b/9a hardiness zone, so the city supports different types of palm trees. Sochi is situated on the same latitude as Nice but strong cold winds from Asia make winters less warm. In fact, temperatures drop below freezing every winter. The highest temperature recorded was 39.4 \u00b0C (102.9 \u00b0F), on July 30, 2000, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221213.4 \u00b0C (7.9 \u00b0F) on January 25, 1892.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status and city divisions ==\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Krasnaya Polyana) and seventy-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Sochi\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Sochi is incorporated as Sochi Urban Okrug.Sochi is administratively subdivided into four city districts: Tsentralny City District, Lazarevsky City District, Khostinsky City District, and Adlersky City District. Tsentralny City District, comprising the central portion of, is by far the smallest out of four in terms of the area, and the other three have comparable areas, with Lazarevsky City District being the biggest. In terms of the population, Tsentralny City District is approximately twice as big as each of the other three city districts.\n\n\n=== Tsentralny City District ===\n\nTsentralny City District, or central Sochi, covers an area of 32 square kilometers (12 sq mi) and, as of the 2010 Census, has a population of 137,677. The highlights include:\n\nMichael Archangel Cathedral, a diminutive church built in 1873\u20131891 to Kaminsky's designs in order to commemorate the victorious conclusion of the Caucasian War.\nThe red-granite Archangel Column, erected in 2006 in memory of the Russian soldiers fallen in Sochi during the Caucasian War. It is capped by a 7-metre bronze statue of Sochi's patron saint, Michael the Archangel.\nSochi Art Museum occupies a large building with a four-columned portico, completed in 1939. The Neoclassical design is by Ivan Zholtovsky.\nSochi Arboretum, a large botanical garden with tropical trees from many countries, and the Mayors Alle\u00e9\u2014a landscape avenue of palm trees planted by mayors from cities around the world.\nThe Tree of Friendship, a hybrid citrus tree planted in 1934 in the Subtropical Botanic Garden. Since 1940 numerous citrus cultivars from foreign countries have been grafted onto this tree as a token of friendship and peace. The associated Friendship Tree Garden Museum has a collection of 20,000 commemorative presents from around the world.\nThe Winter Theater (1934\u20131937) is another rigorously Neoclassical edifice, surrounded by 88 Corinthian columns, with a pediment bearing the statues of Terpsichore, Melpomene and Thalia, all three cast by Vera Mukhina.\nHall of Organ and Chamber Music. Located centrally in the city of Sochi it conducts organ, symphony, chamber-ensemble, choral, vocal music concerts. All year round the Sochi Symphony Orchestra, local actors of the city art groups, famous Russian and international performers, International Contests Winners and Laureates give concerts here.\nThe Maritime Passenger Terminal (1955) is notable for its distinctive 71-meter-high steepled tower and four statues symbolizing the cardinal points.\nThe Railway Station (1952) is one of the most remarkable buildings of Sochi.\nThe Riviera Park was established by Vasily Alexeyevich Khludov in 1883 in the part of the city which later became known as Khludovskaya. The park is popular with tourists and local residents alike. It has a variety of attractions, including an outcrop of funny statues and a \"glade of friendship\" where magnolia trees were planted by every Soviet cosmonaut, among other notables.\n\n\n=== Lazarevsky City District ===\n\nLazarevsky City District lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people. It is the largest city district by area, covering some 1,744 square kilometers (673 sq mi) and comprising several microdistricts:\n\nLazarevskoye, 59 km (37 mi) from the city center, contains a delphinarium, an old church (1903), and a new church (1999). The settlement was founded as a Russian military outpost in 1839 and was named after Admiral Mikhail Lazarev.\nLoo, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, was once owned by Princes Loov, a noble Abkhazian family. The district contains the ruins of a medieval church, founded in the 8th century, rebuilt in the 11th century, and converted into a fortress in the Late Middle Ages.\nDagomys, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, has been noted for its botanical garden, established by order of Nicholas II, as well as tea plantations and factories. A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins Bocharov Ruchey, a dacha built for Kliment Voroshilov in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the President of Russia, where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.\nGolovinka is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the Ubykhs and the Shapsugs, the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the Subashi landing of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted Decembrists used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the Crimean War, so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.\nFort Godlik, of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the Khazars and revived by the Genoese in the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Khostinsky City District ===\n\nKhostinsky City District, sprawling to the southeast from the city center, occupies approximately 374 square kilometers (144 sq mi), with a population of 65,229 as of the 2010 Census. The district is traversed by many rivulets which give their names to the microdistricts of Matsesta (\"flame-colored river\"), Kudepsta, and Khosta (\"the river of boars\").\n\n\n=== Adlersky City District ===\n\nAdlersky City District, with an area of 1,352 square kilometers (522 sq mi) and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census, is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient Sadz village and a medieval Genoese trading post.\nAmong the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation from about 30,000 years ago. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages (auls), the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nAlso located here are the largest trout fishery in Russia (founded in 1964) and a breeding nursery for great apes.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%).\nThe city is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi's Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey's northeastern Black Sea coast who came in the late 19th century and on. The rest are Armenians from Georgia (particularly from Abkhazia and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Armenia (especially from Shirak Province due to the 1988 earthquake).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Sochi region in the Middle Ages. The region was relatively isolated before 1829. In the North, a few hundred Sunni Muslim Shapsugs, a part of the Circassian nation, lived around Tkhagapsh, near Lazarevskoye. The Circassians (also known as Adyghe) converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread to the region.Currently, Sochi is a large predominantly Christian city, though there are thought to be around 20,000 Muslims (5% of inhabitants) living there now (the majority are Adyghe) plus other Eastern Caucasians, Turks, Tatars, and other smaller Muslim groups.A mosque was built in 2008 by United Arab Emirates in the central area of Bytkha, in addition to the old mosque being around 40 km (25 miles) north of the city center in the Adyghe aul of Tkhagapsh.\nThere are around thirty Russian Orthodox churches, the largest being St. Michael's, and two monasteries, plus two Catholic churches, one in the center of Sochi and the other in Lazarevskoye. The Armenian community, which is important in Sochi, gathers in about ten churches.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSochi is home to the following high educational institutions (masters level degree and PhD):  Sochi State University, Russian International Innovative University, and Russian International Olympic University.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\nSochi is also known for its sport facilities: a local tennis school spawned the careers of such notable players as Grand Slam champions Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Kafelnikov spent much of his childhood here, while Sharapova relocated to Florida at the age of seven). In late 2005, the Russian Football Union announced that it was planning to establish a year-round training center for the country's national teams in Sochi. The city's warm climate was cited as one of the main incentives. Sochi is also the home for the football team PFC Sochi which plays in the Russian Premier League and for the ice hockey team HC Sochi which plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\n\n=== 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===\n\nThe nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor at Krasnaya Polyana was the location of the alpine and Nordic events for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nIn June 2006, the International Olympic Committee announced that Sochi had been selected as a finalist city to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On July 4, 2007, Sochi was announced as the host city of the 2014 Winter Games, edging out Pyeongchang, South Korea and Salzburg, Austria.This was Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The site of a training centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi saw concern and controversy following a new federal law approved in Russia in June 2013 that bans \"homosexual propaganda to minors\". There were also concerns over Islamist militants.\n\n\n==== Construction work ====\n\nThe state-controlled RAO UES announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30 billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014. The power generating companies Inter RAO UES and RusHydro would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants\u2014and the federal grid company FGC UES has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW\u2014of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. \"The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6 billion rubles (about US $3.26 billion), of which 50 billion rubles (about US$2 billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid,\" the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8 billion rubles (about US$1.9 billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38 billion roubles (about US$1.48 billion) of that.\n\n\n=== Other sports events ===\n\nThe Silk Way Rally which is part of Dakar series took place in Sochi in 2010 for the last stage between the capital of the Republic of Adygea Maykop to the city of Sochi through Pseshwap.President Vladimir Putin reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone for the city to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix from 2014.The World Robot Olympiad took place in the Adler Arena Skating Center on November 21\u201323, 2014.\nThe 2014 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen was played in Sochi in November 2014, with Carlsen emerging as the winner.\nThe Fisht Olympic Stadium was also used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches.\nSince 2014, the city has hosted HC Sochi, who play at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in the Kontinental Hockey League, the biggest ice hockey league in Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nPublic transport is represented mainly by bus and taxi. Sochi is served by the Adler-Sochi International Airport. Types of non-mass public transport include two funiculars (at the Central military sanatorium and Ordzhonikidze resort) and three cable cars (at arboretum sanatorium \"Dawn\" and pension \"Neva\") also has several cableways in Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe Sochi Port terminal building was built in 1955 by Karo Alabyan and Leonid Karlik in Stalinist architecture. It is topped with a 71-meter steepled tower. Sculptures embodying seasons and cardinal points are set above the tower's three tiers.\nFive of the railway stations of Sochi were renovated for the 2014 Winter Olympics. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta and Khosta railway stations. In Adler city district of Sochi, the original railway station was preserved and new railway station was built near it.

        "wiki": "Sochi (Russian: \u0421\u043e\u0301\u0447\u0438, IPA: [\u02c8sot\u0255\u026a] (listen)) is a city in Krasnodar Krai. It is located in Western Russia, on the Black Sea coast near Russia's southern border. The Greater Sochi area, which includes territories and localities subordinated to Sochi proper, has a total area of 3,526 square kilometers (1,361 sq mi) and sprawls for 145 kilometers (90 mi) along the shores of the Black Sea near the Caucasus Mountains. The area of the city proper is 176.77 square kilometers (68.25 sq mi). According to the 2010 Census, the city had a permanent population of 343,334, up from 328,809 recorded in the 2002 Census, making it Russia's largest resort city. Being part of the Caucasian Riviera, it is one of the very few places in Russia with a subtropical climate, with warm to hot summers and mild winters.\nWith the alpine and Nordic events held at the nearby ski resort of Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi hosted the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, as well as the Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix from 2014 until at least 2020. It was also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore the whole area was conquered by Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian invaders, the Zygii people lived in Lesser Abkhazia under the Kingdom of Pontus, then the Roman Empire's influence in antiquity. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of Lazica and Abkhazia, who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was unified under the single Georgian monarchy in 11th-century, forming one of the Saeristavo, known as Tskhumi extending its possessions up to Nicopsis. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading Alans, Khazars, Mongols and other nomadic empires whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century Byzantine basilica still stands in the Loo Microdistrict.From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi known as Ubykhia was part of historical Circassia, and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, which was their principal trading partner in the Muslim world.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nThe coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Caucasian War and the Russo-Turkish War, 1828\u20131829; however, the Circassians did not admit the Russian control over Circassia and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the Circassian coast (Adyghe: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044b \u0430\u0443\u0448\u0443). Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the Russian Empire and the British Empire that occurred in 1836 over the mission of the Vixen.The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron Feodor Tornau investigated the coastal route from Gelendzhik to Gagra, and across the mountains to Kabarda, in the 1830s. In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the Sochi River as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky in order to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on Cape Adler soon after.\nThe last battle of the Caucasian War took place at the Godlikh river on March 18, 1864 O.S., where the Ubykhs were defeated by the Dakhovsky regiment of the Russian Army. On March 25, 1864, the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of Caucasian War was proclaimed at Kbaade tract (modern Krasnaya Polyana) on June 2 (21 May O.S.), 1864, by the manifesto of Emperor Alexander II read aloud by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia.After the end of Caucasian War (during the period of 1864\u20131870) almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the Shapsugs, who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed in the Circassian Genocide or expelled to the Ottoman Empire (see Circassian Genocide). Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia.In 1874\u20131891, the first Russian Orthodox church, St. Michael's Church, was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed Dakhovsky Posad on April 13, 1874 (O.S.). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky Posad was renamed Sochi Posad (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed Black Sea Governorate. In 1900\u20131910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, \"Kavkazskaya Riviera\", opened on June 14, 1909 (O.S.). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Soviet time ===\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the littoral area saw sporadic armed clashes involving the Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev's Constructivist Institute of Rheumatology (1927\u20131931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Modern Russia ===\nFollowing Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimean Peninsula (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a Greater Sochi which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGreater Sochi is elongated along the Black Sea coast for 145 kilometers (90 mi). Sochi is approximately 1,603 kilometers (996 mi) from Moscow.The city of Sochi borders with Tuapsinsky District in the northwest, with Apsheronsky District and with Maykopsky District of the Republic of Adygea in the north, with Mostovsky District in the northeast, and with Georgia/Abkhazia in the southeast. From the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea.\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are Lazarevskoye, Loo, Dagomys, central Sochi (Tsentralny City District), Khosta, Matsesta, and Adler. The whole city is located on the slopes of the Western Caucasus which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the Mzymta, which is in fact the longest Black Sea tributary in Russia, and the Shakhe. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the Sochi, the Khosta, and the Matsesta. The Psou River makes the border with Abkhazia.\nThe northeastern part of the city belongs to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve which is a World Heritage Site spanning vast areas in Krasnodar Krai and Adygea. Almost the whole area of the Greater Sochi, with the exception of the coast and of the area which belong to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, are included into Sochi National Park.\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters (average 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from December to March and warm summers (average 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) during the day and 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from May to October.\n\n\n=== Layout and landmarks ===\nSochi is unique among larger Russian cities as having some aspects of a subtropical resort. Apart from the scenic Caucasus Mountains, pebble and sand beaches, the city attracts vacation-goers with its subtropical vegetation, numerous parks, monuments, and extravagant Stalinist architecture. About two million people visit Greater Sochi each summer, when the city is home to the annual film festival \"Kinotavr\" and a getaway for Russia's elite.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 2,957 square kilometers (731,000 acres) Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, lies just north from the city. Sochi also has the region's most northerly tea plantations.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), at the lower elevations. Its average annual temperature is 18.4 \u00b0C (65.1 \u00b0F) during the day and 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) at night. In the coldest months\u2014January and February\u2014the average temperature is about 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) during the day, above 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). In the warmest months\u2014July and August\u2014the temperature typically ranges from 25 to 29 \u00b0C (77 to 84 \u00b0F) during the day, about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 23\u201324 \u00b0C (73\u201375 \u00b0F). Yearly sunshine hours are around 2,200. Generally, the summer season lasts four months, from June to September. Two months\u2014April and November\u2014are transitional; sometimes temperatures reach 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with an average temperature of around 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) during the day and 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at night. December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperature (of these four months) 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night. Average annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters (67 in). Sochi lies at 8b/9a hardiness zone, so the city supports different types of palm trees. Sochi is situated on the same latitude as Nice but strong cold winds from Asia make winters less warm. In fact, temperatures drop below freezing every winter. The highest temperature recorded was 39.4 \u00b0C (102.9 \u00b0F), on July 30, 2000, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221213.4 \u00b0C (7.9 \u00b0F) on January 25, 1892.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status and city divisions ==\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Krasnaya Polyana) and seventy-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Sochi\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Sochi is incorporated as Sochi Urban Okrug.Sochi is administratively subdivided into four city districts: Tsentralny City District, Lazarevsky City District, Khostinsky City District, and Adlersky City District. Tsentralny City District, comprising the central portion of, is by far the smallest out of four in terms of the area, and the other three have comparable areas, with Lazarevsky City District being the biggest. In terms of the population, Tsentralny City District is approximately twice as big as each of the other three city districts.\n\n\n=== Tsentralny City District ===\n\nTsentralny City District, or central Sochi, covers an area of 32 square kilometers (12 sq mi) and, as of the 2010 Census, has a population of 137,677. The highlights include:\n\nMichael Archangel Cathedral, a diminutive church built in 1873\u20131891 to Kaminsky's designs in order to commemorate the victorious conclusion of the Caucasian War.\nThe red-granite Archangel Column, erected in 2006 in memory of the Russian soldiers fallen in Sochi during the Caucasian War.

The park is popular with tourists and local residents alike. It has a variety of attractions, including an outcrop of funny statues and a \"glade of friendship\" where magnolia trees were planted by every Soviet cosmonaut, among other notables.\n\n\n=== Lazarevsky City District ===\n\nLazarevsky City District lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people. It is the largest city district by area, covering some 1,744 square kilometers (673 sq mi) and comprising several microdistricts:\n\nLazarevskoye, 59 km (37 mi) from the city center, contains a delphinarium, an old church (1903), and a new church (1999).

A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins Bocharov Ruchey, a dacha built for Kliment Voroshilov in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the President of Russia, where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.\nGolovinka is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the Ubykhs and the Shapsugs, the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the Subashi landing of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted Decembrists used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the Crimean War, so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.\nFort Godlik, of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the Khazars and revived by the Genoese in the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Khostinsky City District ===\n\nKhostinsky City District, sprawling to the southeast from the city center, occupies approximately 374 square kilometers (144 sq mi), with a population of 65,229 as of the 2010 Census. The district is traversed by many rivulets which give their names to the microdistricts of Matsesta (\"flame-colored river\"), Kudepsta, and Khosta (\"the river of boars\").\n\n\n=== Adlersky City District ===\n\nAdlersky City District, with an area of 1,352 square kilometers (522 sq mi) and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census, is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient Sadz village and a medieval Genoese trading post.\nAmong the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation from about 30,000 years ago. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages (auls), the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nAlso located here are the largest trout fishery in Russia (founded in 1964) and a breeding nursery for great apes.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%).\nThe city is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi's Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey's northeastern Black Sea coast who came in the late 19th century and on. The rest are Armenians from Georgia (particularly from Abkhazia and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Armenia (especially from Shirak Province due to the 1988 earthquake).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Sochi region in the Middle Ages. The region was relatively isolated before 1829. In the North, a few hundred Sunni Muslim Shapsugs, a part of the Circassian nation, lived around Tkhagapsh, near Lazarevskoye. The Circassians (also known as Adyghe) converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread to the region.Currently, Sochi is a large predominantly Christian city, though there are thought to be around 20,000 Muslims (5% of inhabitants) living there now (the majority are Adyghe) plus other Eastern Caucasians, Turks, Tatars, and other smaller Muslim groups.A mosque was built in 2008 by United Arab Emirates in the central area of Bytkha, in addition to the old mosque being around 40 km (25 miles) north of the city center in the Adyghe aul of Tkhagapsh.\nThere are around thirty Russian Orthodox churches, the largest being St. Michael's, and two monasteries, plus two Catholic churches, one in the center of Sochi and the other in Lazarevskoye. The Armenian community, which is important in Sochi, gathers in about ten churches.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSochi is home to the following high educational institutions (masters level degree and PhD):  Sochi State University, Russian International Innovative University, and Russian International Olympic University.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\nSochi is also known for its sport facilities: a local tennis school spawned the careers of such notable players as Grand Slam champions Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Kafelnikov spent much of his childhood here, while Sharapova relocated to Florida at the age of seven). In late 2005, the Russian Football Union announced that it was planning to establish a year-round training center for the country's national teams in Sochi. The city's warm climate was cited as one of the main incentives. Sochi is also the home for the football team PFC Sochi which plays in the Russian Premier League and for the ice hockey team HC Sochi which plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\n\n=== 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===\n\nThe nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor at Krasnaya Polyana was the location of the alpine and Nordic events for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nIn June 2006, the International Olympic Committee announced that Sochi had been selected as a finalist city to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On July 4, 2007, Sochi was announced as the host city of the 2014 Winter Games, edging out Pyeongchang, South Korea and Salzburg, Austria.This was Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The site of a training centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi saw concern and controversy following a new federal law approved in Russia in June 2013 that bans \"homosexual propaganda to minors\". There were also concerns over Islamist militants.\n\n\n==== Construction work ====\n\nThe state-controlled RAO UES announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30 billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014. The power generating companies Inter RAO UES and RusHydro would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants\u2014and the federal grid company FGC UES has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW\u2014of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. \"The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6 billion rubles (about US $3.26 billion), of which 50 billion rubles (about US$2 billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid,\" the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8 billion rubles (about US$1.9 billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38 billion roubles (about US$1.48 billion) of that.\n\n\n=== Other sports events ===\n\nThe Silk Way Rally which is part of Dakar series took place in Sochi in 2010 for the last stage between the capital of the Republic of Adygea Maykop to the city of Sochi through Pseshwap.President Vladimir Putin reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone for the city to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix from 2014.The World Robot Olympiad took place in the Adler Arena Skating Center on November 21\u201323, 2014.\nThe 2014 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen was played in Sochi in November 2014, with Carlsen emerging as the winner.\nThe Fisht Olympic Stadium was also used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches.\nSince 2014, the city has hosted HC Sochi, who play at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in the Kontinental Hockey League, the biggest ice hockey league in Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nPublic transport is represented mainly by bus and taxi. Sochi is served by the Adler-Sochi International Airport. Types of non-mass public transport include two funiculars (at the Central military sanatorium and Ordzhonikidze resort) and three cable cars (at arboretum sanatorium \"Dawn\" and pension \"Neva\") also has several cableways in Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe Sochi Port terminal building was built in 1955 by Karo Alabyan and Leonid Karlik in Stalinist architecture. It is topped with a 71-meter steepled tower. Sculptures embodying seasons and cardinal points are set above the tower's three tiers.\nFive of the railway stations of Sochi were renovated for the 2014 Winter Olympics. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta and Khosta railway stations. In Adler city district of Sochi, the original railway station was preserved and new railway station was built near it. Another new railway station was built in Estosadok, close to Krasnaya Polyana.\nAt some point, plans to construct the light metro network to serve the Olympics were considered; however, the Sochi Light Metro plan was abandoned in favor of the reconstruction of the railway.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nYuri Nikolaevich Denisyuk, physicist\nMikhail Galustyan, comedian\nAndre Geim, physicist, graphene researcher and 2010 Nobel Prize winner\nYevgeny Kafelnikov, tennis player, former World No. 1 tennis player\nDaria Kondakova, rhythmic gymnast\nGrigory Leps, singer, songwriter, musician of Georgian origin\nSlava Metreveli, Georgian/Soviet association football player\nVladimir Nemshilov, Olympic swimmer\nBoris Nemtsov, politician\nMordechai Spiegler, Russian-Israeli association football player and manager\nVladimir Tkachenko, basketball player\nElena Vesnina, tennis player\nKharis Yunichev, the first Soviet male swimmer to win an Olympic medal\nAnna Zak, Israeli celebrity\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nSochi is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nFederation Island\nSochi Police\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0432\u0437\u0430\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044e \u0441 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0410\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f. \u0421\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u211634.01-707/13-03 \u043e\u0442 23 \u043c\u0430\u044f 2013 \u0433. \u00ab\u0420\u0435\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f\u00bb.

        "wiki": "Sochi (Russian: \u0421\u043e\u0301\u0447\u0438, IPA: [\u02c8sot\u0255\u026a] (listen)) is a city in Krasnodar Krai. It is located in Western Russia, on the Black Sea coast near Russia's southern border. The Greater Sochi area, which includes territories and localities subordinated to Sochi proper, has a total area of 3,526 square kilometers (1,361 sq mi) and sprawls for 145 kilometers (90 mi) along the shores of the Black Sea near the Caucasus Mountains. The area of the city proper is 176.77 square kilometers (68.25 sq mi). According to the 2010 Census, the city had a permanent population of 343,334, up from 328,809 recorded in the 2002 Census, making it Russia's largest resort city. Being part of the Caucasian Riviera, it is one of the very few places in Russia with a subtropical climate, with warm to hot summers and mild winters.\nWith the alpine and Nordic events held at the nearby ski resort of Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi hosted the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, as well as the Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix from 2014 until at least 2020. It was also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore the whole area was conquered by Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian invaders, the Zygii people lived in Lesser Abkhazia under the Kingdom of Pontus, then the Roman Empire's influence in antiquity. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of Lazica and Abkhazia, who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was unified under the single Georgian monarchy in 11th-century, forming one of the Saeristavo, known as Tskhumi extending its possessions up to Nicopsis. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading Alans, Khazars, Mongols and other nomadic empires whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century Byzantine basilica still stands in the Loo Microdistrict.From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi known as Ubykhia was part of historical Circassia, and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, which was their principal trading partner in the Muslim world.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nThe coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Caucasian War and the Russo-Turkish War, 1828\u20131829; however, the Circassians did not admit the Russian control over Circassia and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the Circassian coast (Adyghe: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044b \u0430\u0443\u0448\u0443). Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the Russian Empire and the British Empire that occurred in 1836 over the mission of the Vixen.The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron Feodor Tornau investigated the coastal route from Gelendzhik to Gagra, and across the mountains to Kabarda, in the 1830s. In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the Sochi River as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky in order to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on Cape Adler soon after.\nThe last battle of the Caucasian War took place at the Godlikh river on March 18, 1864 O.S., where the Ubykhs were defeated by the Dakhovsky regiment of the Russian Army. On March 25, 1864, the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of Caucasian War was proclaimed at Kbaade tract (modern Krasnaya Polyana) on June 2 (21 May O.S.), 1864, by the manifesto of Emperor Alexander II read aloud by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia.After the end of Caucasian War (during the period of 1864\u20131870) almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the Shapsugs, who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed in the Circassian Genocide or expelled to the Ottoman Empire (see Circassian Genocide). Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia.In 1874\u20131891, the first Russian Orthodox church, St. Michael's Church, was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed Dakhovsky Posad on April 13, 1874 (O.S.). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky Posad was renamed Sochi Posad (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed Black Sea Governorate. In 1900\u20131910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, \"Kavkazskaya Riviera\", opened on June 14, 1909 (O.S.). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Soviet time ===\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the littoral area saw sporadic armed clashes involving the Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev's Constructivist Institute of Rheumatology (1927\u20131931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Modern Russia ===\nFollowing Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimean Peninsula (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a Greater Sochi which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGreater Sochi is elongated along the Black Sea coast for 145 kilometers (90 mi). Sochi is approximately 1,603 kilometers (996 mi) from Moscow.The city of Sochi borders with Tuapsinsky District in the northwest, with Apsheronsky District and with Maykopsky District of the Republic of Adygea in the north, with Mostovsky District in the northeast, and with Georgia/Abkhazia in the southeast. From the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea.\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are Lazarevskoye, Loo, Dagomys, central Sochi (Tsentralny City District), Khosta, Matsesta, and Adler. The whole city is located on the slopes of the Western Caucasus which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the Mzymta, which is in fact the longest Black Sea tributary in Russia, and the Shakhe. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the Sochi, the Khosta, and the Matsesta. The Psou River makes the border with Abkhazia.\nThe northeastern part of the city belongs to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve which is a World Heritage Site spanning vast areas in Krasnodar Krai and Adygea. Almost the whole area of the Greater Sochi, with the exception of the coast and of the area which belong to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, are included into Sochi National Park.\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters (average 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from December to March and warm summers (average 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) during the day and 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from May to October.\n\n\n=== Layout and landmarks ===\nSochi is unique among larger Russian cities as having some aspects of a subtropical resort. Apart from the scenic Caucasus Mountains, pebble and sand beaches, the city attracts vacation-goers with its subtropical vegetation, numerous parks, monuments, and extravagant Stalinist architecture. About two million people visit Greater Sochi each summer, when the city is home to the annual film festival \"Kinotavr\" and a getaway for Russia's elite.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 2,957 square kilometers (731,000 acres) Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, lies just north from the city. Sochi also has the region's most northerly tea plantations.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), at the lower elevations. Its average annual temperature is 18.4 \u00b0C (65.1 \u00b0F) during the day and 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) at night. In the coldest months\u2014January and February\u2014the average temperature is about 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) during the day, above 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). In the warmest months\u2014July and August\u2014the temperature typically ranges from 25 to 29 \u00b0C (77 to 84 \u00b0F) during the day, about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 23\u201324 \u00b0C (73\u201375 \u00b0F). Yearly sunshine hours are around 2,200. Generally, the summer season lasts four months, from June to September. Two months\u2014April and November\u2014are transitional; sometimes temperatures reach 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with an average temperature of around 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) during the day and 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at night. December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperature (of these four months) 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night. Average annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters (67 in). Sochi lies at 8b/9a hardiness zone, so the city supports different types of palm trees. Sochi is situated on the same latitude as Nice but strong cold winds from Asia make winters less warm. In fact, temperatures drop below freezing every winter. The highest temperature recorded was 39.4 \u00b0C (102.9 \u00b0F), on July 30, 2000, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221213.4 \u00b0C (7.9 \u00b0F) on January 25, 1892.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status and city divisions ==\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Krasnaya Polyana) and seventy-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Sochi\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Sochi is incorporated as Sochi Urban Okrug.Sochi is administratively subdivided into four city districts: Tsentralny City District, Lazarevsky City District, Khostinsky City District, and Adlersky City District. Tsentralny City District, comprising the central portion of, is by far the smallest out of four in terms of the area, and the other three have comparable areas, with Lazarevsky City District being the biggest. In terms of the population, Tsentralny City District is approximately twice as big as each of the other three city districts.\n\n\n=== Tsentralny City District ===\n\nTsentralny City District, or central Sochi, covers an area of 32 square kilometers (12 sq mi) and, as of the 2010 Census, has a population of 137,677. The highlights include:\n\nMichael Archangel Cathedral, a diminutive church built in 1873\u20131891 to Kaminsky's designs in order to commemorate the victorious conclusion of the Caucasian War.\nThe red-granite Archangel Column, erected in 2006 in memory of the Russian soldiers fallen in Sochi during the Caucasian War. It is capped by a 7-metre bronze statue of Sochi's patron saint, Michael the Archangel.\nSochi Art Museum occupies a large building with a four-columned portico, completed in 1939. The Neoclassical design is by Ivan Zholtovsky.\nSochi Arboretum, a large botanical garden with tropical trees from many countries, and the Mayors Alle\u00e9\u2014a landscape avenue of palm trees planted by mayors from cities around the world.\nThe Tree of Friendship, a hybrid citrus tree planted in 1934 in the Subtropical Botanic Garden. Since 1940 numerous citrus cultivars from foreign countries have been grafted onto this tree as a token of friendship and peace. The associated Friendship Tree Garden Museum has a collection of 20,000 commemorative presents from around the world.\nThe Winter Theater (1934\u20131937) is another rigorously Neoclassical edifice, surrounded by 88 Corinthian columns, with a pediment bearing the statues of Terpsichore, Melpomene and Thalia, all three cast by Vera Mukhina.\nHall of Organ and Chamber Music. Located centrally in the city of Sochi it conducts organ, symphony, chamber-ensemble, choral, vocal music concerts. All year round the Sochi Symphony Orchestra, local actors of the city art groups, famous Russian and international performers, International Contests Winners and Laureates give concerts here.\nThe Maritime Passenger Terminal (1955) is notable for its distinctive 71-meter-high steepled tower and four statues symbolizing the cardinal points.\nThe Railway Station (1952) is one of the most remarkable buildings of Sochi.\nThe Riviera Park was established by Vasily Alexeyevich Khludov in 1883 in the part of the city which later became known as Khludovskaya. The park is popular with tourists and local residents alike. It has a variety of attractions, including an outcrop of funny statues and a \"glade of friendship\" where magnolia trees were planted by every Soviet cosmonaut, among other notables.\n\n\n=== Lazarevsky City District ===\n\nLazarevsky City District lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people. It is the largest city district by area, covering some 1,744 square kilometers (673 sq mi) and comprising several microdistricts:\n\nLazarevskoye, 59 km (37 mi) from the city center, contains a delphinarium, an old church (1903), and a new church (1999). The settlement was founded as a Russian military outpost in 1839 and was named after Admiral Mikhail Lazarev.\nLoo, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, was once owned by Princes Loov, a noble Abkhazian family. The district contains the ruins of a medieval church, founded in the 8th century, rebuilt in the 11th century, and converted into a fortress in the Late Middle Ages.\nDagomys, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, has been noted for its botanical garden, established by order of Nicholas II, as well as tea plantations and factories. A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins Bocharov Ruchey, a dacha built for Kliment Voroshilov in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the President of Russia, where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.\nGolovinka is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the Ubykhs and the Shapsugs, the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the Subashi landing of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted Decembrists used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the Crimean War, so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.\nFort Godlik, of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the Khazars and revived by the Genoese in the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Khostinsky City District ===\n\nKhostinsky City District, sprawling to the southeast from the city center, occupies approximately 374 square kilometers (144 sq mi), with a population of 65,229 as of the 2010 Census. The district is traversed by many rivulets which give their names to the microdistricts of Matsesta (\"flame-colored river\"), Kudepsta, and Khosta (\"the river of boars\").\n\n\n=== Adlersky City District ===\n\nAdlersky City District, with an area of 1,352 square kilometers (522 sq mi) and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census, is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient Sadz village and a medieval Genoese trading post.\nAmong the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation from about 30,000 years ago. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages (auls), the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nAlso located here are the largest trout fishery in Russia (founded in 1964) and a breeding nursery for great apes.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%).\nThe city is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi's Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey's northeastern Black Sea coast who came in the late 19th century and on. The rest are Armenians from Georgia (particularly from Abkhazia and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Armenia (especially from Shirak Province due to the 1988 earthquake).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Sochi region in the Middle Ages. The region was relatively isolated before 1829. In the North, a few hundred Sunni Muslim Shapsugs, a part of the Circassian nation, lived around Tkhagapsh, near Lazarevskoye. The Circassians (also known as Adyghe) converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread to the region.Currently, Sochi is a large predominantly Christian city, though there are thought to be around 20,000 Muslims (5% of inhabitants) living there now (the majority are Adyghe) plus other Eastern Caucasians, Turks, Tatars, and other smaller Muslim groups.A mosque was built in 2008 by United Arab Emirates in the central area of Bytkha, in addition to the old mosque being around 40 km (25 miles) north of the city center in the Adyghe aul of Tkhagapsh.\nThere are around thirty Russian Orthodox churches, the largest being St. Michael's, and two monasteries, plus two Catholic churches, one in the center of Sochi and the other in Lazarevskoye. The Armenian community, which is important in Sochi, gathers in about ten churches.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSochi is home to the following high educational institutions (masters level degree and PhD):  Sochi State University, Russian International Innovative University, and Russian International Olympic University.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\nSochi is also known for its sport facilities: a local tennis school spawned the careers of such notable players as Grand Slam champions Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Kafelnikov spent much of his childhood here, while Sharapova relocated to Florida at the age of seven). In late 2005, the Russian Football Union announced that it was planning to establish a year-round training center for the country's national teams in Sochi. The city's warm climate was cited as one of the main incentives. Sochi is also the home for the football team PFC Sochi which plays in the Russian Premier League and for the ice hockey team HC Sochi which plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\n\n=== 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===\n\nThe nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor at Krasnaya Polyana was the location of the alpine and Nordic events for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nIn June 2006, the International Olympic Committee announced that Sochi had been selected as a finalist city to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On July 4, 2007, Sochi was announced as the host city of the 2014 Winter Games, edging out Pyeongchang, South Korea and Salzburg, Austria.This was Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The site of a training centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi saw concern and controversy following a new federal law approved in Russia in June 2013 that bans \"homosexual propaganda to minors\". There were also concerns over Islamist militants.\n\n\n==== Construction work ====\n\nThe state-controlled RAO UES announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30 billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014. The power generating companies Inter RAO UES and RusHydro would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants\u2014and the federal grid company FGC UES has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW\u2014of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. \"The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6 billion rubles (about US $3.26 billion), of which 50 billion rubles (about US$2 billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid,\" the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8 billion rubles (about US$1.9 billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38 billion roubles (about US$1.48 billion) of that.\n\n\n=== Other sports events ===\n\nThe Silk Way Rally which is part of Dakar series took place in Sochi in 2010 for the last stage between the capital of the Republic of Adygea Maykop to the city of Sochi through Pseshwap.President Vladimir Putin reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone for the city to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix from 2014.The World Robot Olympiad took place in the Adler Arena Skating Center on November 21\u201323, 2014.\nThe 2014 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen was played in Sochi in November 2014, with Carlsen emerging as the winner.\nThe Fisht Olympic Stadium was also used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches.\nSince 2014, the city has hosted HC Sochi, who play at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in the Kontinental Hockey League, the biggest ice hockey league in Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nPublic transport is represented mainly by bus and taxi. Sochi is served by the Adler-Sochi International Airport. Types of non-mass public transport include two funiculars (at the Central military sanatorium and Ordzhonikidze resort) and three cable cars (at arboretum sanatorium \"Dawn\" and pension \"Neva\") also has several cableways in Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe Sochi Port terminal building was built in 1955 by Karo Alabyan and Leonid Karlik in Stalinist architecture. It is topped with a 71-meter steepled tower. Sculptures embodying seasons and cardinal points are set above the tower's three tiers.\nFive of the railway stations of Sochi were renovated for the 2014 Winter Olympics. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta and Khosta railway stations. In Adler city district of Sochi, the original railway station was preserved and new railway station was built near it.

          "There`s one place in Sochi i would prefer to avoid going to and that`s Riviera park, crowded any season, cramped with cheap fun at exaggetated prices, annoying vendors, crap food, no fun for parents and very little joy for the kids, well they have sort of a dinosaur exposition,",

          "We had a very mixed feeling about this park. The grounds are nicely kept, and there is a good selection of the rides and other experiences. But the biggest problem is a very aggressive advertisement, and leaflets handed out by the promoters. It\u2019s unbearable, every single step",

          "What I saw of Riviera park was basically a grand carnival/amusement park, not unlike what you would se at a state fair, but very well done. Clean and not too obnoxious, actually very pleasant by midway standards. I was there to go to the dolphinarium show, so the rest was sort",

          "Well, you probably better don't compare with amusement parks in Europe and the US but it's pretty decent. We were offered to buy a family ticket which costs like 1500 rub and it was 21 rides, which I consider pretty reasonable, it was enough for 3 of us. It included not all the",

Located in Sochi Olympic Park and named after Mount Fisht, the 40,000-capacity stadium was constructed for the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, where it served as the venue for their opening and closing ceremonies. \nThe stadium was originally built as an enclosed facility; it was re-opened in 2016 as an open-air football stadium, to host matches as part of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup when it was known simply as Fisht Stadium.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nFisht Olympic Stadium was designed by Populous and British design consultancy BuroHappold Engineering.  The stadium's roof was built from approximately 36,500 square metres (393,000 sq ft) of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) and was designed to give the roof the appearance of snowy peaks. The bowl opens to the north, allowing a direct view of the Krasnaya Polyana Mountains, and the upper deck is open to the south, allowing a view of the Black Sea.The canopy over the Western and Eastern stands is covered with translucent ethylene tetrafluoroethylene. The material offers superior strength and corrosion resistance.\nFisht is a UEFA category 4 stadium.\nThe field size of the Fisht Stadium is 105x68 m. The stadium has four stands: two on the sides under a translucent polycarbonate canopy and two open front stands.\n\n2006. Initial estimates placed the cost of construction to Russia at 1.7 billion rubles.\nThe architectural design was developed by Populous, a company with previous experience in designing similar facilities for Johannesburg.\n2008. Site clearing and purchasing of land began.\nStarting in 2008, the Government began to clear the territory for the future Olympic facility, buying land from the local population.\n2010. Construction of the Fisht Stadium began. A symbolic capsule was planted bearing the message \u201cBelieve in yourself, and together we will win\u201d and marking the start of construction.\n2011. The initial design was altered. According to some sources, changes were made at the request of Director of the Olympics Opening Ceremony Konstantin Ernst.\n2013. Construction of the stadium was completed. The stadium was the last Olympics facility to be commissioned.Having opened in 2013, it cost US$779 million to build the stadium. The stadium complex now serves as a training centre and match venue for the Russia national football team, and served as a site for matches during the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The stadium's capacity will be temporarily expanded to 41,220 through temporary seating at the open ends of the stadium. The capacity will be reduced to 40,000 after the World Cup in 2018.\n\n\n== Location and access ==\nFisht Stadium is located in Sochi, in the Sochi Olympic Park in Adler, south of the Sochi Airport, at 15 Olympic Avenue.\nThe Fisht Stadium can be reached by buses 57, 117, 125, 134, 173. A suburban electric train Sochi\u2013Adler\u2013Olympic Park also provides access to the stadium.\n\n\n== Safety and security ==\nBy 15 March 2017, the stadium obtained a building safety certificate, detailing its evacuation routes, fire-fighting systems and emergency response procedures. The certificate was a legal confirmation that Fisht was ready to host matches of the FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup. During the 2018 FIFA World Cup matches, the stadium will be serviced by 2,000 surveillance cameras and 600 EMERCOM employees will be ensuring the security at Fisht.\n\n\n== Post-Olympics usage ==\n\nIn January 2015, a 3 billion ruble (US$46 million) project began to renovate the stadium in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup; among other changes, the closed roof was removed in order to make the stadium compliant with FIFA regulations. The work was expected to be completed by June 2016, but the completion date was pushed back to November 2016. The ground became the second to host the Winter Olympics and World Cup, after the Stadio Olimpico in Turin, Italy.\nAfter the World Cup, FC Dynamo Saint Petersburg of the second division moved from St. Petersburg to Sochi to play in the Fisht Stadium. The team became PFC Sochi, the first professional club in the city since the disbanding of FC Zhemchuzhina-Sochi in 2013.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nIn October 2013, the Central Bank of Russia issued a commemorative 100-ruble note to mark 100 days before the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics. The blue-tinted banknote depicts a flying snowboarder on one side, and on the other the Fisht Olympic Stadium and a firebird.\n\n\n== Tournament results ==\n\n\n=== 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup ===\n\n\n=== 2018 FIFA World Cup ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Fisht Olympic Stadium at Wikimedia Commons\n\nFisht Olympic stadium construction\nhttp://welcome2018.com/sch\nhttp://vb.me/sch_stadium\nhttp://sch_stadium_eng",

        "wiki": "Armavia Flight 967 (U8 967/RNV 967) was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Armavia from Zvartnots International Airport, Zvarnots in Armenia to Sochi, a Black Sea coastal resort city in Russia. On 3 May 2006, the aircraft operating the route, an Airbus A320-200, crashed into the sea while attempting to go-around following its first approach to Sochi airport, killing all 113 aboard.The accident was the first major commercial airline crash in the year of 2006. It was Armavia's first and only fatal crash.\n\n\n== Flight ==\nThe aircraft took off from Zvartnots International Airport (EVN) at a scheduled departure time at 01:45 Armenian Daylight Time (20:45 UTC, May 2) and with a scheduled arrival time at Sochi International Airport (AER) of 02:00 Moscow Daylight Time (22:00 UTC, May 2).In order to make their decision for departure, the crew obtained the observed weather data and the weather forecast for the takeoff, landing and alternate aerodromes all of which met the requirements for IFR flights. All the crew were correctly licensed and adequately rested to operate the flight.\nThe airplane took off from Zvartnots airport at 20:47. There were 113 occupants on board: 105 passengers (including 5 children and 1 infant), 2 pilots,1 aircraft engineer and 5 flight attendants. Takeoff, climb and cruise were uneventful.\nThe first communication between Sochi approach controller and the crew took place at 21:10. At that moment the airplane was beyond the coverage area of the Sochi radar. Up until 21:17 the approach controller and the crew discussed the observed and forecast weather, and as a result the crew decided to return to Yerevan. At 21:26, after the decision had already been made, the crew asked the controller about the latest observed weather. At 21:30 the controller informed the crew that visibility was 3,600 metres (2.2 mi) and the cloud ceiling 170 m (560 ft). At 21:31 the crew decided to continue the flight to Sochi airport.\nThe next communication with the approach controller was at 22:00. At that moment the aircraft was descending to an altitude of 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and was being tracked by the Sochi radar. The approach controller cleared the flight for a descent to 1,800 m (5,900 ft) and reported the observed weather at Sochi, as at 22:00, for runway 06, which was above the minimums.\nThe crew was then handed over to the holding and tower controllers, and was cleared for descent to 600 m (2,000 ft), before entering the turn to the final approach. Whilst performing the turn, the runway extended centreline was overshot. After eliminating the deviation, the crew started descending the aircraft along the glide slope, following the approach pattern.\nAt 22:10 the crew reported that the gear was down and that they were ready for landing. In response they were advised that they were 10 kilometres (6.2 mi; 5.4 nmi) from the airport and that the weather was now 4,000 m (13,000 ft) visibility x 190 m (620 ft) cloud ceiling, and were cleared for landing. However, about 30 seconds later, the controller advised the crew of the observed cloud ceiling at 100 m (330 ft) and instructed them to cease their descent, abandon the landing attempt, and carry out a right turn and climb to 600 m (2,000 ft) and also to contact the holding controller, who gives instructions for entering the airport's holding pattern.\nThe last communication with the crew was at 22:12. After that the crew did not respond to any of the controller's calls. At 22:13 the aircraft struck the water, and broke up on impact.\n\n\n== Aircraft ==\n\nThe aircraft involved was built in France with its first flight in June 1995. It had a MSN number of 547 with a test registration code of F-WWIU. The aircraft was delivered in 1995 to Ansett Australia, registered in Australia as VH-HYO. It was acquired by Armavia in 2004 registered as EK-32009 with its name as Mesrop Mashtots. Armavia repainted the aircraft with its new livery on 31 October 2004. The aircraft had flown more than 10,000 hours before the crash.\n\n\n== Passengers and crew ==\n\nMost of the passengers were citizens of Armenia. According to reports, the flight had 85 Armenian citizens, 26 Russian citizens, one Georgian citizen, and one Ukrainian citizen.\nCitizenship of the passengers and crewThe Captain of Flight 967 was Grigor Grigoryan. Born in 1966, he had completed his primary training in Krasnokutsk Civil Flight School. He graduated in 1986 and also graduated from Moscow Institute of Civil Aviation Engineers. He joined Balaklavsky United as a co-pilot in 1986. He then joined Ararat Airlines in 1997 as a Captain of a Yakovlev Yak-40. He then joined Armavia as a co-pilot of an Airbus A320 in 2004 and subsequently promoted to a Captain in 2005. He had passed a test for an Airbus A320 Captain in SAS Flight Academy in Stockholm, Sweden with satisfying results. Captain Grigoryan had a total flight hours of 5,458 hours, including 1,436 hours on the Airbus A320.The First Officer (Co-pilot) of Flight 967 was Arman Davtyan. He was born in 1977 and had completed his primary training in Ulyanovsk Civil Flying School and graduated in 1999. He then joined Chernomor-Avia in December 2001 as a co-pilot of a Tupolev Tu-154. He joined Armavia in 2002, joined Armenian Airlines in 2004, and then joined Armavia again in the same year. First Officer Davtyan had passed a training course for an Airbus A320 in SAS Flight Academy in Stockholm, Sweden with satisfying results. He had a total flying hours of 2,185 hours, including 1,022 hours on the Airbus A320.\n\n\n== Recovery efforts ==\nFlight 967 disappeared from Sochi's radar at 02:13 local time. Chief of Flight Operation N.G Savelyev alerted all the search and rescue services in the area and deployed an Mi-8 helicopter. At 02:19, the disappearance of Flight 967 was informed to Russia's Minister of Emergencies. A search helicopter was ready for take off to find the missing flight, but was not allowed by Sochi due to the deteriorating weather. The search and rescue operation was then suspended. At 04:08, the Ministry of Emergency's boat Valery Zamarayez found the probable crash area. Rescuers then went to the search area. From 07:30 to 12:30, the search and rescue team recovered 9 body parts from the crash site.Search and rescue personnel only managed to recover some of the flight's debris. They recovered the Airbus' nose, landing gear, fin, elevator, and several other fragments. Wiring and electronic units were also found. A total of 52 body fragments were found by the search and rescue team as well. The BEA noted that, at the time when Flight 967 impacted the sea, the landing gear was extended. The lower part of the rudder was severely damaged due to the impact forces. Several parts of the aircraft elevator were also damaged. Some of the aircraft parts recovered from the sea were severely deformed.\n\n\n== Causes ==\n\n\n=== Weather ===\nThe weather at the time was considered to be fine. Low pressure was present near Sochi at the time. A cold front was also detected and was forming in the Caucasian Edge and further to the east of Turkey at the time. Rain was also present in Adler (Sochi). In the spring transition period, low clouds often occurred in the Caucasian Edge, which, could have limited visibility for the pilots. This proved to be dangerous, as most Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) occurs due to this kind of cloud (which obscures the pilots visual reference).Prior to take off from Yerevan, the crew was briefed on the weather conditions in Sochi. At the time, the weather in Sochi was fine. After the take off of Flight 967, the pilots were given another weather briefing. It was still in good condition, with considerable clouds, mist, and light rain. The weather at the time would not have allowed for a vortex (i.e. storm, tornado, downdraft). In the following hours, the probability that a vortex might occur was reduced to zero. By the time Flight 967 entered Sochi, the weather conditions had deteriorated. A cold front wave occurred in Sochi, producing Cumulonimbus cloud. The rain intensified, and the visibility was reduced to 1,500 m. For several minutes, the weather became better for landing. The controllers instructed Flight 967 to abort their descent and conduct a go-around immediately, as low clouds were present in Sochi Airport. Shortly afterwards, Flight 967 disappeared from Sochi Radar.\n\n\n=== Recorders analysis ===\nShortly after Flight 967 impacted water, the radio beacon signals, known as the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), started to sound. French BEA retrieved the submerged Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR) from the Black Sea and found that there were only minor damages in both recorders. BEA later examined both the CVR and the FDR.\n\n\n==== Examination ====\nBased on the examination, the flight was uneventful until the approach. However, during the cruise stage of the flight, First Officer Davtyan stated: \"**** it.. who operates such flights with the jitter and not enough sleep\". This may indicate that he didn't have adequate sleeping hours, meaning he was fatigued at the time. The BEA also noted that neither pilot understood how the autopilot of an Airbus A320 works. Analysis of the internal communications at this stage of the flight shows that Captain Grigoryan was annoyed by the fact that in DESCENT mode (MANAGED MODE) the descent rate was not as high as he expected. BEA noted that in this mode, the descent rate is calculated automatically, depending on a number of parameters describing the descent, e.g. the aircraft attitude in relation to the preset profile and so on. This fact shows that either the Captain did not fully understand the autopilot work algorithm in the DESCENT mode, or was in a state of high psycho-emotional strain with an imperative to land at Sochi as soon as possible.\nFlight 967 was then instructed by Sochi Tower to pass waypoint GUKIN and TABAN. It then passed both waypoints. While banking to turn to final approach, the rain started. First Officer Davtyan then overreacted by saying exclamation words, possibly due to emotional stress. The Sochi controller then told the crew of Flight 967 that the weather in Sochi had deteriorated, and instructed the pilot to abort their descent. The crew overreacted to this report, responding with negative words and expletives to the controller. The crew had been discussing the issue for three minutes, swearing about the controller's actions even between the items on the check list. Such behaviour by the crew must have inevitably resulted in an increase of their psycho-emotional stress.\nThe aircraft climbed, started to bank and the flaps were extended to 18\u00b0. At this point, Captain Grigoryan was heard in the CVR saying: \"**** him\" to the Sochi controller. The crew then contacted Sochi's holding controller, as well as the final controller. They then selected the \"glide-slope capture\" descent mode, which is an automatic descent. The aircraft was descending with two engaged autopilots and engaged auto-thrust. The speed was controlled by the auto-thrust at the target speed of 137 kn (254 km/h), stabilised on the glide-slope, in the landing configuration and ready for landing. The crew then proceed to the landing check list.\nSochi Tower instructed them to abort their descent and conduct a go-around, as low clouds had formed near the airport. The aircraft climbed, the thrust levers were moved to climb position, the flaps and slats remained fully extended, and the landing gear remained fully extended. A few minutes later, the \"Speed Speed Speed\" (LOW ENERGY) warning sounded. This warning advises the crew that \"the aircraft energy is decreasing to the limit, below which the engine thrust must be increased to regain a positive angle of the flight path\". At the moment when the aural warning sounded, the aircraft altitude was 1,150 ft (350 m), the crew then pushed the TO/GA button.\nBEA stated that none of the crew's actions were important and necessary for a go-around procedure, such as extending the flaps and the landing gear. This demonstrated that, at that time, both flight crews' condition were not at the optimum level. BEA also suspected that the LOW ENERGY warning wasn't detected or noticed by the crew.\nThe autopilot was then disengaged by the crew, as they cast doubts on the autopilot (on the cruise stage of the flight, First Officer Davtyan joked about the autopilot, stating that Captain Grigoryan's autopilot was better than him, indicating that they had doubts about the autopilot and suspected that it wasn't functioning properly.) Captain Grigoryan then banked the aircraft to the right.\nBoth crew members then became more physically and emotionally stressed, as further conversations among them revealed that their intonations became higher and higher. The aircraft then decreased its pitch up attitude and banked to the right. Then, one of the crew stepped on the rudder pedals, causing the rudder to deflect. This was not necessary. The BEA suspect that Captain Grigoryan stepped the pedals, while under psycho-emotional stress. Due to the emotional stress he was suffering at the time, he didn't notice that he had stepped the pedals.\nBEA then found that the crew may have been suffering a somatogravic illusion in flight. Somatogravic illusion, in aviation, is a type of optical illusion which can cause the crew to think that they are pitching up, while in reality, they are not. This could happen during night-time flying (causing the crew to lose their visual reference, as it was dark) accompanied by the lack of monitoring of the flight's indicator. Somatogravic illusion was responsible for the crash of Gulf Air Flight 072 in Bahrain. However, the BEA also suspected the specific features of the speed indication on the PFD, especially speed limitations for the Airbus A320 configuration that are shown as the red bars at the top of the speed indication strip. One of the crew members might have adopted the reflex acquired in training, for example, in response to a TCAS warning when the pilot is anxious to avoid the displayed red part of the instrument scale, which may result in the instinctive forward movement of the side stick, especially when the pilot is in a state of psycho-emotional strain. This version is substantiated by the fact that the pilot was monitoring the flight speed and its limitations (VFE) that depended on the Airbus A320 configuration and retracted the flaps and slats in a timely manner, and the control inputs on the side stick coincided with the moments when the current speed was getting close to the limit value. However, neither of these probable causes have enough evidence.\nThe crew of Flight 967 then communicated with Sochi Tower. Their words were not completed; \"Sochi Radar, Armavia 967...\". This was the last communication from Flight 967, as Captain Grigoryan ordered First Officer Davtyan to fully extend the flaps.After First Officer Davtyan extended the flaps to full, few seconds later, the master warning sounded, and continued to do so until the end of the recording. The speed at the time was too fast, which could tear the flaps apart and could cause the plane to crash, similar to Austral Lineas Aereas Flight 2553. The plane was banking to the right. Flight 967 began a nose-down attitude and the flaps then retracted to 18\u00b0. Captain Grigoryan then made an 11\u00b0 nose-down input, causing the plane to descend even further.\nCaptain Grigoryan aggravated the condition further by making a right bank input, causing the plane to bank severely to the right, with a roll angle of 39\u00b0. The Ground Proximity Warning System then sounded. First Officer Davtyan then ordered Captain Grigoryan to level off. At this moment, First Officer Davtyan intervened and moved the stick to the left position (20\u00b0 to the left) to counter the increasing right bank, while Captain Grigoryan continued making his control inputs to increase the right bank. Apparently, First Officer Davtyan was trying to counter the bank only, as he also made a nose-down input, causing the plane to descend even further.\nWhile intervening, First Officer Davtyan had not pressed the take-over push button, therefore, both pilot's control inputs were added and prohibited. This is known as dual input. Such dual piloting is prohibited. The dual input warning should have sounded at the time, however, because its priority is lower than the Ground Proximity Warning, it did not, and so neither pilot knew that they were making dual inputs on the aircraft.\nThe crew's attention might have been distracted by the controller's direction. The controller was sending the crew a 20-second long message, which was too long. While the plane was descending, one of the crew members suddenly moved the thrust lever way back, into its idle position, and then moved the thrust lever forward, causing the autothrottle to disengage. The crew then desperately tried to lift the plane up, but the plane impacted water at a speed of 285 knots (528 km/h; 328 mph), killing all on board instantly.\n\n\n=== Primary conclusions of the final accident report ===\nThe crash of Armavia Flight 967 was a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT), specifically water, while conducting a climbing maneuver after an aborted approach to Sochi airport at night with weather conditions below landing minimums for runway 06.\nWhile performing the climb with the autopilot disengaged, the captain, being in a psychoemotional stress condition, made nose down control inputs due to the loss of pitch and roll awareness. This started the abnormal situation. The captain's insufficient pitch control inputs led to a failure to recover the aircraft and caused it to crash.\nAlong with the inadequate control inputs from the captain, the contributing factors of the crash were also the lack of monitoring the aircraft's pitch attitude, altitude and vertical speed by the first officer and no proper reaction by the crew to GPWS warnings.\n\n\n=== Contributory factors and shortcomings ===\nSource:\n\n\n== Safety recommendations ==\nTo eliminate the shortcomings revealed during investigation of this accident, the final accident report made 22 safety recommendations as follows:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft\nEthiopian Airlines Flight 409\nFlydubai Flight 981\nAir China Flight 129\nAfriqiyah Airways Flight 771\nGulf Air Flight 072\n2016 Russian Defence Ministry Tupolev Tu-154 crash, a plane that crashed in 2016 near Flight 967 site.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAccident description at the Aviation Safety Network\nFinal accident report - (Statistics about the crash) \u2013 Interstate Aviation Committee \u2013 English translation done by and hosted by the Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) (Archive, Alternate, Archive) \u2013 Includes comments by the BEA on the investigation, and the IAC's response to the BEA's comments\nInvestigation and Report (Archive) - (Statistics about the crash) \u2013 Interstate Aviation Committee (in Russian) \u2013 The Russian version is the version of record\nTechnical Report (in Russian) (Archive)\nBureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'Aviation Civile\n\"Accident near Sochi on 2 May 2006.\" (Archive)\nArmeniapedia.org article on the crash\nAirDisaster.com \u2013 Armenian A320 crashes into Black Sea (Archive)\nARMAVIA FLIGHT RNV 967 ACCIDENT IN SOCHI, RUSSIA (Archive) \u2013 Airbus",

        "wiki": "Rob Hornstra (born 14 March 1975, in Borne, Overijssel) is a Dutch photographer and self-publisher of documentary work, particularly of areas of the former Soviet Union.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHornstra studied Social and Legal Services at Utrecht University of Applied Sciences from 1994 to 1998; for a year from summer 1996, he interned and then worked as a probation officer. From September 1998, he worked for over eight years as a host and bartender at Muziekcentrum Vredenburg in Utrecht. From 1999 to 2004, he studied photographic design at Utrecht School of the Arts.For his graduation project he spent one month in Russia photographing the lives of the first generation of young people growing up after the fall of communism. In the same year that he graduated he published this series as his first book, Communism and Cowgirls.\nSince graduation Hornstra has combined editorial work for newspapers and magazines with more personal, longer-term documentary work in the Netherlands, Iceland, and the former Soviet Union. Hornstra considers himself a maker of photographic documentaries rather than a photographer; when not photographing for a particular purpose, he does not carry a camera. Further, he sees books as more important than exhibitions, and regards his own editing, publication and marketing of books of his photography as an important part of his work.Hornstra prefers to work with film, in medium format or large format:\n\n[It] takes me quite a bit of time to set up my Mamiya medium-format camera and Horseman large-format camera. And that allows me to shoot more spontaneous pictures. Yes, it sounds contradictory. But snapshots aren't always so spontaneous by any means. When people have to pose for a long time, they eventually relax. Then you can really take nice pictures of them.\nIn 2006, together with the art historian Femke Lutgerink, Hornstra started work on Fotodok, an Utrecht-based organization that arranges exhibitions and other events for documentary photography. Itself inspired by Fotohof in Salzburg, Fotodok hopes eventually to create an exhibition space for documentary photography in Utrecht. Fotodok was launched in 2008; Hornstra stepped down as creative director in September 2009.\n\nStarting with his first collection, Communism and Cowgirls, Hornstra has published his own books. These skip forewords by other writers, biographical notes, ISBNs and the other trappings of conventionally published books; by taking advance orders and selling copies directly and also working through a small number of retailers, Hornstra is able to avoid normal distribution channels.Together with the writer and filmmaker Arnold van Bruggen, in 2009 Hornstra started the Sochi Project, which over five years would document the area of Sochi (Krasnodar Krai, Russia) and the changes to it during the preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Hornstra and Van Bruggen express surprise that the site chosen for such a large winter event would be one so close to politically volatile areas such as Abkhazia and one that by Russian standards has exceptionally mild winters. Under the slogan slow journalism, the pair request donations from the public for the crowdfunding of a project whose timescale is impossible for the mass media. The stories Hornstra and Van Bruggen collected as part of the project have appeared in newspapers, photobooks and online over the course of the five-year period. The project culminated in the retrospective book An Atlas of War and Tourism in the Caucasus published by Aperture in 2013, and in 2014 an exhibition that toured Europe, America and Canada.\nHornstra and Van Bruggen have also created more democratic exhibitions, made entirely of newsprint, that can be shown on the walls of small galleries with no budget for framed prints or video installations: On the Other Side of the Mountains (2010), two copies of which create an exhibition; Paris Photo Newsprint Exhibition (2012), with thirty photographs; and three versions of Billboard Sochi Singers, each containing the sheets to assemble either of two posters.Critic Sean O'Hagan, writing in The Guardian, said \"Whichever way you look at it, The Sochi Project is an incredible piece of journalism, both visual and written, and a glimpse of the medium's future.\"In 2019, Hornstra and Van Bruggen announced the start of another long-term project: The Europeans, inspired by Henri Cartier-Bresson's 1955 book The Europeans and prompted by the recent rise of voters and regimes dissatisfied with the European ideal.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n\n=== Solo exhibitions, and pair exhibitions with Arnold van Bruggen ===\n\nCommunism and Cowgirls, Fotohof, Salzburg, 2005.\nCommunism and Cowgirls, De Balie, Amsterdam, 2006.\nRoots of the R\u00fantur, National Museum of Iceland, Reykjav\u00edk, 2006.\n101 Billionaires and Other Stories, Flatland Gallery, Utrecht, 2009.\nThe Sochi Project, Mandeep Photography, Rome; Spazio Labo' \u2013 Centro di Fotografia, Bologna, 2010.\nViews from Sochi.

In October 2011, the Russian government set aside US$195.4 million for the construction of the circuit.The construction of the Sochi Olympic Park Circuit marked the end of a thirty-year campaign for a Russian Grand Prix, with plans for a \"Grand Prix of the Soviet Union\" originating as early as 1983 before being abandoned for \"bureaucratic reasons\" and several failed attempts in the intervening years.\nThe circuit received its final approval from the FIA in August 2014.\n\n\n== The circuit ==\n\nThe 5.848-kilometre (3.634 mi) circuit is the fourth-longest circuit on the Formula One calendar, behind Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium, Baku City Circuit in Azerbaijan and Silverstone in the UK. The circuit is built around the Sochi Olympic Park, that is the coastal cluster of Olympic venues built for the 2014 Winter Olympics that have hosted competitions in ice hockey, speed skating, curling, figure skating, short track etc., and Fisht Olympic Stadium where Opening and Closing ceremonies were held. The surface was not laid until after the Closing Ceremony of the Olympics.\n\nThe circuit, designed by German architect Hermann Tilke, has the start grid on the northern edge of the Olympic Park next to the railway station, heading southwest towards the Black Sea coast. Then it runs along the outer edge of the central Sochi Medals Plaza, that is the podium for Olympic medal ceremonies. The long Turn 3 is one of the most notable on the circuit, and has been compared to the famous Turn 8 in Istanbul Park. Then, the track circles the plaza counterclockwise and makes three turns around the Bolshoy Ice Dome. Then follow series of tight corners before turning north where the track skirts the edge of the Olympic Park, above the main Olympic Village and the Adler Arena Skating Center. Then it passes the skating and curling centres, before funneling up behind the pit paddock toward the train station, and completing a circuit with two ninety-degree right turns.\n\n\n== Lap records ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n2014 Winter Olympics\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSochi Autodrom photos\nOMEGA Center (official development site)\nSochi Autodrom Guide\nSochi Autodrom on Google Maps (Current Formula 1 Tracks)",

The town was previously known under the names Nikopol, Acheisos, Anakopia, Nikopia, Nikofia, Nikopsis, Absara, and Psyrtskha.\nNew Athos Cave is one of Abkhazia's tourist attractions.\n\n\n== Ancient history ==\n\nA large ancient Greek port town of Anacopia was recorded there in the 3rd century. Its ruins are still visible. In the 5th century, Georgians  built a fortress on the top of the Iverian Mountain. Anacopia was the capital of the Abkhazian princedom in the orbit of the Byzantine Empire and then of the Abkhazian Kingdom after the archon Leon II declared himself a king in the late 8th century. Later, the capital was moved to Kutaisi.\nAnacopia was ceded to Byzantine Empire by Demetre in 1033 but was retaken by Georgians in 1072 among the other territories Georgia gained as a result of the Empire's defeat at Manzikert at the hands of Seljuks.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLocated between the Black Sea and the Iverian Mountain, New Athos is 17 km far from Gudauta, 22 from Sukhumi and 84 from the Russian borders at Vesyoloye, a village near the city of Sochi.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nVitali Smyr was reappointed as Mayor on 10 May 2001 following the March 2001 local elections.On 8 May 2003, Smyr was appointed Minister for Agriculture and released as Mayor of New Athos. On 19 May, Feliks Dautia was appointed his successor.\n\n\n=== List of mayors ===\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Monastery ===\n\nIn 1874 Russian monks from the overcrowded Rossikon Monastery on Mount Athos arrived to the Caucasus in order to find a place for possible resettlement. They feared that the Ottoman Empire would oust the Russians from Athos after the outbreak of the impending Russo-Turkish War. They selected Psyrtskha, and the Neo-Byzantine New Athos Monastery, dedicated to St. Simon the Canaanite, was constructed there in the 1880s with funds provided by Tsar Alexander III of Russia. Eventually Russian monks were permitted to stay in the \"old\" Athos, and the New Athos monastery had much less occupancy than anticipated.\nIn 1924, during the Soviet persecution of religion, the monastery was closed. It was later used as a storage facility, tourist base, hospital and museum. Its return to the Orthodox Church began in 1994, after the end of the war.\nThe scenic setting of the New Athos monastery by the sea has made it a popular destination with Russian tourists visiting Abkhazia. An older church of St. Simon the Canaanite, dated to the 9th-10th century and reconstructed in the 1880s, is located near the town, on the Psyrtskha stream.\n\n\n=== Hydroelectric power station ===\nNew Athos has a small hydroelectric power station and artificial lake on the Psyrtskha river, close to the old Church of St. Simon the Canaanite. The station was built by the monks of the monastery between 1892 and 1903 and repaired in 1922. It remained broken for over forty years before being repaired again \u2014 it was re-opened on 4 June 2012. It produces an estimated 100 kW per hour for the monastery which still owns it.\n\n\n=== Cave ===\n\nNew Athos cave is a karst cave in the Iverian Mountain, few km far from the town. Since 1975 it is served by the New Athos Cave Railway.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nNew Athos is twinned with:\n\n Sergiyev Posad, Russia\n Sarov, Russia\n Ryazan, Russia\n Calasetta, Italy\n\n\n== See also ==\nMount Athos\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to New Athos at Wikimedia Commons\n New Athos travel guide from Wikivoyage",

          "Very good ski resort, new and beautiful, only down point are the extra long lines...you have to wait too much for lifts.",
          "The only two negative comments are : all is written just in Russian so it is hard on navigation. Also the people at site hardly if at all speak English other then this great ski lanes for all Levels and decent price. About 5000 tubal for daily ski pass and full equipment rental.",
          "The Radisson is an excellent hotel. The service staff are all good. The restaurant is very good. The conference facilities are excellent. The hotel is located right inside the village so there is easy access to the chair lifts, the river, the public walkways and the stores.",
          "I have visited this place with my friends. Many activities to do. If you will stay at Risa Khutor, you have to go to Rosa Peak 2320 meters above the sea using few gandoles. At every level have some activities that must try: bridge, observation desk, free small photo, good",
          "The place is so romantic during the summer where you can enjoy the nice cool weather with a glass of wine.. wonderful place for couples and family .. not infants due to the low temperature ... the costs are reasonable and affordable.. love it .. mainly HEAVEN",
          "If you planning to travel to Sochi, you most visit Rosa Khutor. It\u2019s really amazing place for kids and adults. I visited on June, the weather was very nice, the little ice on the top of mountain making the view more beautiful but it wasn\u2019t cold. There is many activities for kids",
          "Of many places I have visit, I consider Sochi to be by favorite destination for its reasonably priced and there are plenty to do. The weather is fantastic and place is very safe. You can sky and swim in the same day. For sport lovers, you will be surprised of how many activities",
          "We stayed at Marriot hotel in Krasnaya Polyana.You can use public bus or taxi to arrive to the site.Dont forget to bring your passport with the white immigration cart.The site offer discount for pensioners.You get English instruction how to climb using the different cable cars",
          "We were on a 3 nights visit to Rosa Khutor. Reached Sochi airport and took a taxi. Reached in 50 minutes. A bit uphill. The town is dissected by a gurgling river with hotels on both sides. There are rope ways/gondolas/cable cars (all same) that take you to 2450 meters on a snow",

          "Very good ski resort, mostly suitable for snowboard because there is no need to unlock and lock the board frequently, people are very friendly, comfortable prices, distance from the airport - 40 minutes drive, very good hotels. The only negative comment is the size of the",
          "Imagine every possible winter/summer/spring/fall mountain activity. Now imagine them all at the highest quality and reasonably priced (at least if you have $$$ in your pocket). Is the architecture a little tacky? Sure, but it's so much fun!",

          "It was my first visit to Sochi and its surroundings and I was having rather strange expectations. Roza Khutor was the first from all we saw, and it was best! It exceeded all my expectations- with very healthy style of life of its guests, with a lot of restaurants and cafes,",

          "I enjoyed Rosa Khutor itself for walking around, the scenery and the choice of restaurants and hotels. However, going into the mountains the waiting time on the lifts was too long up on the slopes. I went back to Gorky Gorod where skiing was more fun, due to less crowds and",

I will highly recommend him to all of my friends once they are visiting Sochi in Russia. We loved all the presentations he did and will hire him for our next",
          "It was a long-lasting dream to visit this place. Finally I've got some free time to visit it. This small place Rosa Khutor is really great for mountain-lovers both lazy ones using cable ways and hikers. This place has all infrastructure for a small vacation or a one-day visit.",

          "It was one of the picks of our visit to Suchi aria. Upon arrival afternoon we me a local youngster dance show, with music, in the center of the village. The river which flows and divides the village to two parts, sounds and give you the filing of being a part of the nature.",
          "I think that this resort was built from nothing, everything seems brand new. And even out of the season, quite busy and crowded. Please note that, if you want to climb up to 2370 m, the cable car runs till late at night, so you will have no problem to do it. Would I go to ski",

          "There are three mountains in this area, where once can snowboard. One of the best is Rosa Khutor. The name of Rosa Khutor actually comes from Estonian woman Rosa, who had a little farmstead there. Regarding snowboarding-a lot of different level slopes, from green to black. What",
          "The ski facilities of the Rosa Khutor resort can be compared with European alpine resorts. It's not the Three Valleys or Italian Dolomite Ski, but it's much more interesting than Bad/Badhof Gastein or Stubai in Austria. The Resort has a plenty of pistes of all the complexity",

          "A wonderful warm just built place with a number of good restaurants and bars and ski riding area on the banks of a picturesque river. The place could be a perfect example of what can be built in Russia, but it failed to do so. During our 1 day visit we: saw a group of strange",
          "I have done my fair share of skiing in the Rockies, and I'd put Rosa up against the best of them. For starters, it is incredibly convenient to get there. Simply take the high-speed train from the airport (or Sochi, if you are looking to combine your seaside and mountain",

          "Lots of pistes of different levels, nice sunny weather and much cheaper compared to the Western Europe",
          "Overall this is a really good option for skiing. It's not at the same level as the Alps or Rockies, but generally better than skiing Vermont or Andorra. Varied difficulty levels - mostly depending on what elevation you're skiing at. Snow conditions were also very dependent",

          "Sochi has potential to be a good ski area for hard core skiing. Like with many regions timing is everything. It sits close to the black Sea so precipitation levels are high but can be warm. The week we arrived Feb 15-22 in Sochi was Spring conditions. A big base of snow.",
          "We went in March 2015. The journey inland - by car - from the Olympic Park / airport takes about 45 minutes - incredible tunnels and scenery. Took a series of modern ski lifts to the top of Rosa Khutor Summit and looked back to the Black Sea. A fantastic day",
          "Choosing between Rosa Khutor and Gornaya Karusel - I would try both, but we liked Rosa Khutor better. Work in progress still, but they are getting there",
          "Returned to Roza Khutor one year later after a very positive experience. Imagine my dismay to find out it has got worse. I understand it was a weekend with exceptional snowfall, not only was fresh snow falling at night, but it kept falling during the day. I don't mind upper ski",
          "Rosa Khutor is a part of krasnayapoliana district. There are some hotels an some cable car from first elevation 540 M to 1196 M high. In summer passengers can use paths for biking instate of ski in winter. fresh weather and moderate temperature are Rosa Khutor priority. view",
          "I only had one day to visit the mountains, and of course it had to rain. However this turned into one of the best opportunities ever. There were very few tourists, and so I had the gondolas to myself. The panorama views were simply unbelievable as you sped up the cables. Because",
          "I was taken to Rosa Khutor without any ideas or preconceptions, upon taking a series cable cars up the mountain to get to the top we see a walking route from the top we walked down a little as we saw some people walking that way, my friend who was local to the region asked some",
          "In summer on the pyrinees or the alps the stations open doors to let people go up by the ski resort facilities. This is yet another one case in the caucasus. But the problem is the amount of people. Almost everybody come from Sochi or Adler and the train is absolutelly full.",

        "wiki": "Sochi (Russian: \u0421\u043e\u0301\u0447\u0438, IPA: [\u02c8sot\u0255\u026a] (listen)) is a city in Krasnodar Krai. It is located in Western Russia, on the Black Sea coast near Russia's southern border. The Greater Sochi area, which includes territories and localities subordinated to Sochi proper, has a total area of 3,526 square kilometers (1,361 sq mi) and sprawls for 145 kilometers (90 mi) along the shores of the Black Sea near the Caucasus Mountains. The area of the city proper is 176.77 square kilometers (68.25 sq mi). According to the 2010 Census, the city had a permanent population of 343,334, up from 328,809 recorded in the 2002 Census, making it Russia's largest resort city. Being part of the Caucasian Riviera, it is one of the very few places in Russia with a subtropical climate, with warm to hot summers and mild winters.\nWith the alpine and Nordic events held at the nearby ski resort of Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi hosted the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, as well as the Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix from 2014 until at least 2020. It was also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore the whole area was conquered by Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian invaders, the Zygii people lived in Lesser Abkhazia under the Kingdom of Pontus, then the Roman Empire's influence in antiquity. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of Lazica and Abkhazia, who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was unified under the single Georgian monarchy in 11th-century, forming one of the Saeristavo, known as Tskhumi extending its possessions up to Nicopsis. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading Alans, Khazars, Mongols and other nomadic empires whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century Byzantine basilica still stands in the Loo Microdistrict.From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi known as Ubykhia was part of historical Circassia, and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, which was their principal trading partner in the Muslim world.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nThe coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Caucasian War and the Russo-Turkish War, 1828\u20131829; however, the Circassians did not admit the Russian control over Circassia and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the Circassian coast (Adyghe: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044b \u0430\u0443\u0448\u0443). Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the Russian Empire and the British Empire that occurred in 1836 over the mission of the Vixen.The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron Feodor Tornau investigated the coastal route from Gelendzhik to Gagra, and across the mountains to Kabarda, in the 1830s. In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the Sochi River as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky in order to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on Cape Adler soon after.\nThe last battle of the Caucasian War took place at the Godlikh river on March 18, 1864 O.S., where the Ubykhs were defeated by the Dakhovsky regiment of the Russian Army. On March 25, 1864, the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of Caucasian War was proclaimed at Kbaade tract (modern Krasnaya Polyana) on June 2 (21 May O.S.), 1864, by the manifesto of Emperor Alexander II read aloud by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia.After the end of Caucasian War (during the period of 1864\u20131870) almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the Shapsugs, who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed in the Circassian Genocide or expelled to the Ottoman Empire (see Circassian Genocide). Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia.In 1874\u20131891, the first Russian Orthodox church, St. Michael's Church, was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed Dakhovsky Posad on April 13, 1874 (O.S.). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky Posad was renamed Sochi Posad (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed Black Sea Governorate. In 1900\u20131910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, \"Kavkazskaya Riviera\", opened on June 14, 1909 (O.S.). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Soviet time ===\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the littoral area saw sporadic armed clashes involving the Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev's Constructivist Institute of Rheumatology (1927\u20131931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Modern Russia ===\nFollowing Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimean Peninsula (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a Greater Sochi which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGreater Sochi is elongated along the Black Sea coast for 145 kilometers (90 mi). Sochi is approximately 1,603 kilometers (996 mi) from Moscow.The city of Sochi borders with Tuapsinsky District in the northwest, with Apsheronsky District and with Maykopsky District of the Republic of Adygea in the north, with Mostovsky District in the northeast, and with Georgia/Abkhazia in the southeast. From the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea.\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are Lazarevskoye, Loo, Dagomys, central Sochi (Tsentralny City District), Khosta, Matsesta, and Adler. The whole city is located on the slopes of the Western Caucasus which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the Mzymta, which is in fact the longest Black Sea tributary in Russia, and the Shakhe. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the Sochi, the Khosta, and the Matsesta. The Psou River makes the border with Abkhazia.\nThe northeastern part of the city belongs to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve which is a World Heritage Site spanning vast areas in Krasnodar Krai and Adygea. Almost the whole area of the Greater Sochi, with the exception of the coast and of the area which belong to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, are included into Sochi National Park.\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters (average 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from December to March and warm summers (average 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) during the day and 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from May to October.\n\n\n=== Layout and landmarks ===\nSochi is unique among larger Russian cities as having some aspects of a subtropical resort. Apart from the scenic Caucasus Mountains, pebble and sand beaches, the city attracts vacation-goers with its subtropical vegetation, numerous parks, monuments, and extravagant Stalinist architecture. About two million people visit Greater Sochi each summer, when the city is home to the annual film festival \"Kinotavr\" and a getaway for Russia's elite.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 2,957 square kilometers (731,000 acres) Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, lies just north from the city. Sochi also has the region's most northerly tea plantations.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), at the lower elevations. Its average annual temperature is 18.4 \u00b0C (65.1 \u00b0F) during the day and 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) at night. In the coldest months\u2014January and February\u2014the average temperature is about 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) during the day, above 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). In the warmest months\u2014July and August\u2014the temperature typically ranges from 25 to 29 \u00b0C (77 to 84 \u00b0F) during the day, about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 23\u201324 \u00b0C (73\u201375 \u00b0F). Yearly sunshine hours are around 2,200. Generally, the summer season lasts four months, from June to September. Two months\u2014April and November\u2014are transitional; sometimes temperatures reach 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with an average temperature of around 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) during the day and 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at night. December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperature (of these four months) 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night. Average annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters (67 in). Sochi lies at 8b/9a hardiness zone, so the city supports different types of palm trees. Sochi is situated on the same latitude as Nice but strong cold winds from Asia make winters less warm. In fact, temperatures drop below freezing every winter. The highest temperature recorded was 39.4 \u00b0C (102.9 \u00b0F), on July 30, 2000, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221213.4 \u00b0C (7.9 \u00b0F) on January 25, 1892.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status and city divisions ==\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Krasnaya Polyana) and seventy-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Sochi\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Sochi is incorporated as Sochi Urban Okrug.Sochi is administratively subdivided into four city districts: Tsentralny City District, Lazarevsky City District, Khostinsky City District, and Adlersky City District. Tsentralny City District, comprising the central portion of, is by far the smallest out of four in terms of the area, and the other three have comparable areas, with Lazarevsky City District being the biggest. In terms of the population, Tsentralny City District is approximately twice as big as each of the other three city districts.\n\n\n=== Tsentralny City District ===\n\nTsentralny City District, or central Sochi, covers an area of 32 square kilometers (12 sq mi) and, as of the 2010 Census, has a population of 137,677. The highlights include:\n\nMichael Archangel Cathedral, a diminutive church built in 1873\u20131891 to Kaminsky's designs in order to commemorate the victorious conclusion of the Caucasian War.\nThe red-granite Archangel Column, erected in 2006 in memory of the Russian soldiers fallen in Sochi during the Caucasian War. It is capped by a 7-metre bronze statue of Sochi's patron saint, Michael the Archangel.\nSochi Art Museum occupies a large building with a four-columned portico, completed in 1939. The Neoclassical design is by Ivan Zholtovsky.\nSochi Arboretum, a large botanical garden with tropical trees from many countries, and the Mayors Alle\u00e9\u2014a landscape avenue of palm trees planted by mayors from cities around the world.\nThe Tree of Friendship, a hybrid citrus tree planted in 1934 in the Subtropical Botanic Garden. Since 1940 numerous citrus cultivars from foreign countries have been grafted onto this tree as a token of friendship and peace. The associated Friendship Tree Garden Museum has a collection of 20,000 commemorative presents from around the world.\nThe Winter Theater (1934\u20131937) is another rigorously Neoclassical edifice, surrounded by 88 Corinthian columns, with a pediment bearing the statues of Terpsichore, Melpomene and Thalia, all three cast by Vera Mukhina.\nHall of Organ and Chamber Music. Located centrally in the city of Sochi it conducts organ, symphony, chamber-ensemble, choral, vocal music concerts. All year round the Sochi Symphony Orchestra, local actors of the city art groups, famous Russian and international performers, International Contests Winners and Laureates give concerts here.\nThe Maritime Passenger Terminal (1955) is notable for its distinctive 71-meter-high steepled tower and four statues symbolizing the cardinal points.\nThe Railway Station (1952) is one of the most remarkable buildings of Sochi.\nThe Riviera Park was established by Vasily Alexeyevich Khludov in 1883 in the part of the city which later became known as Khludovskaya. The park is popular with tourists and local residents alike. It has a variety of attractions, including an outcrop of funny statues and a \"glade of friendship\" where magnolia trees were planted by every Soviet cosmonaut, among other notables.\n\n\n=== Lazarevsky City District ===\n\nLazarevsky City District lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people. It is the largest city district by area, covering some 1,744 square kilometers (673 sq mi) and comprising several microdistricts:\n\nLazarevskoye, 59 km (37 mi) from the city center, contains a delphinarium, an old church (1903), and a new church (1999). The settlement was founded as a Russian military outpost in 1839 and was named after Admiral Mikhail Lazarev.\nLoo, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, was once owned by Princes Loov, a noble Abkhazian family. The district contains the ruins of a medieval church, founded in the 8th century, rebuilt in the 11th century, and converted into a fortress in the Late Middle Ages.\nDagomys, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, has been noted for its botanical garden, established by order of Nicholas II, as well as tea plantations and factories. A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins Bocharov Ruchey, a dacha built for Kliment Voroshilov in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the President of Russia, where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.\nGolovinka is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the Ubykhs and the Shapsugs, the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the Subashi landing of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted Decembrists used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the Crimean War, so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.\nFort Godlik, of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the Khazars and revived by the Genoese in the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Khostinsky City District ===\n\nKhostinsky City District, sprawling to the southeast from the city center, occupies approximately 374 square kilometers (144 sq mi), with a population of 65,229 as of the 2010 Census. The district is traversed by many rivulets which give their names to the microdistricts of Matsesta (\"flame-colored river\"), Kudepsta, and Khosta (\"the river of boars\").\n\n\n=== Adlersky City District ===\n\nAdlersky City District, with an area of 1,352 square kilometers (522 sq mi) and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census, is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient Sadz village and a medieval Genoese trading post.\nAmong the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation from about 30,000 years ago. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages (auls), the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nAlso located here are the largest trout fishery in Russia (founded in 1964) and a breeding nursery for great apes.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%).\nThe city is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi's Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey's northeastern Black Sea coast who came in the late 19th century and on. The rest are Armenians from Georgia (particularly from Abkhazia and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Armenia (especially from Shirak Province due to the 1988 earthquake).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Sochi region in the Middle Ages. The region was relatively isolated before 1829. In the North, a few hundred Sunni Muslim Shapsugs, a part of the Circassian nation, lived around Tkhagapsh, near Lazarevskoye. The Circassians (also known as Adyghe) converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread to the region.Currently, Sochi is a large predominantly Christian city, though there are thought to be around 20,000 Muslims (5% of inhabitants) living there now (the majority are Adyghe) plus other Eastern Caucasians, Turks, Tatars, and other smaller Muslim groups.A mosque was built in 2008 by United Arab Emirates in the central area of Bytkha, in addition to the old mosque being around 40 km (25 miles) north of the city center in the Adyghe aul of Tkhagapsh.\nThere are around thirty Russian Orthodox churches, the largest being St. Michael's, and two monasteries, plus two Catholic churches, one in the center of Sochi and the other in Lazarevskoye. The Armenian community, which is important in Sochi, gathers in about ten churches.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSochi is home to the following high educational institutions (masters level degree and PhD):  Sochi State University, Russian International Innovative University, and Russian International Olympic University.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\nSochi is also known for its sport facilities: a local tennis school spawned the careers of such notable players as Grand Slam champions Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Kafelnikov spent much of his childhood here, while Sharapova relocated to Florida at the age of seven). In late 2005, the Russian Football Union announced that it was planning to establish a year-round training center for the country's national teams in Sochi. The city's warm climate was cited as one of the main incentives. Sochi is also the home for the football team PFC Sochi which plays in the Russian Premier League and for the ice hockey team HC Sochi which plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\n\n=== 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===\n\nThe nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor at Krasnaya Polyana was the location of the alpine and Nordic events for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nIn June 2006, the International Olympic Committee announced that Sochi had been selected as a finalist city to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On July 4, 2007, Sochi was announced as the host city of the 2014 Winter Games, edging out Pyeongchang, South Korea and Salzburg, Austria.This was Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The site of a training centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi saw concern and controversy following a new federal law approved in Russia in June 2013 that bans \"homosexual propaganda to minors\". There were also concerns over Islamist militants.\n\n\n==== Construction work ====\n\nThe state-controlled RAO UES announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30 billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014. The power generating companies Inter RAO UES and RusHydro would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants\u2014and the federal grid company FGC UES has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW\u2014of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. \"The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6 billion rubles (about US $3.26 billion), of which 50 billion rubles (about US$2 billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid,\" the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8 billion rubles (about US$1.9 billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38 billion roubles (about US$1.48 billion) of that.\n\n\n=== Other sports events ===\n\nThe Silk Way Rally which is part of Dakar series took place in Sochi in 2010 for the last stage between the capital of the Republic of Adygea Maykop to the city of Sochi through Pseshwap.President Vladimir Putin reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone for the city to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix from 2014.The World Robot Olympiad took place in the Adler Arena Skating Center on November 21\u201323, 2014.\nThe 2014 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen was played in Sochi in November 2014, with Carlsen emerging as the winner.\nThe Fisht Olympic Stadium was also used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches.\nSince 2014, the city has hosted HC Sochi, who play at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in the Kontinental Hockey League, the biggest ice hockey league in Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nPublic transport is represented mainly by bus and taxi. Sochi is served by the Adler-Sochi International Airport. Types of non-mass public transport include two funiculars (at the Central military sanatorium and Ordzhonikidze resort) and three cable cars (at arboretum sanatorium \"Dawn\" and pension \"Neva\") also has several cableways in Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe Sochi Port terminal building was built in 1955 by Karo Alabyan and Leonid Karlik in Stalinist architecture. It is topped with a 71-meter steepled tower. Sculptures embodying seasons and cardinal points are set above the tower's three tiers.\nFive of the railway stations of Sochi were renovated for the 2014 Winter Olympics. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta and Khosta railway stations. In Adler city district of Sochi, the original railway station was preserved and new railway station was built near it. Another new railway station was built in Estosadok, close to Krasnaya Polyana.\nAt some point, plans to construct the light metro network to serve the Olympics were considered; however, the Sochi Light Metro plan was abandoned in favor of the reconstruction of the railway.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nYuri Nikolaevich Denisyuk, physicist\nMikhail Galustyan, comedian\nAndre Geim, physicist, graphene researcher and 2010 Nobel Prize winner\nYevgeny Kafelnikov, tennis player, former World No. 1 tennis player\nDaria Kondakova, rhythmic gymnast\nGrigory Leps, singer, songwriter, musician of Georgian origin\nSlava Metreveli, Georgian/Soviet association football player\nVladimir Nemshilov, Olympic swimmer\nBoris Nemtsov, politician\nMordechai Spiegler, Russian-Israeli association football player and manager\nVladimir Tkachenko, basketball player\nElena Vesnina, tennis player\nKharis Yunichev, the first Soviet male swimmer to win an Olympic medal\nAnna Zak, Israeli celebrity\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nSochi is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nFederation Island\nSochi Police\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0432\u0437\u0430\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044e \u0441 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0410\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f. \u0421\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u211634.01-707/13-03 \u043e\u0442 23 \u043c\u0430\u044f 2013 \u0433. \u00ab\u0420\u0435\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f\u00bb.

        "wiki": "Trabzon (Turkish pronunciation: [\u02c8t\u027eabzon]), historically known as Trebizond in English, is a city on the Black Sea coast of northeastern Turkey and the capital of Trabzon Province. Trabzon, located on the historical Silk Road, became a melting pot of religions, languages and culture for centuries and a trade gateway to Persia in the southeast and the Caucasus to the northeast. The Venetian and Genoese merchants paid visits to Trebizond during the medieval period and sold silk, linen and woolen fabric.\nBoth republics had merchant colonies within the city \u2013 Leonkastron and the former 'Venetian castle' \u2013 that played a role to Trebizond similar to the one Galata played to Constantinople (modern Istanbul). Trabzon formed the basis of several states in its long history and was the capital city of the Empire of Trebizond between 1204 and 1461. During the early modern period, Trabzon, because of the importance of its port, again became a focal point of trade to Persia and the Caucasus.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe Turkish name of the city is Trabzon. It is historically known in English as Trebizond. The first recorded name of the city is the Greek T\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 (Trapezous), referencing the table-like central hill between the Za\u011fnos (\u0130skeleboz) and Kuzgun streams on which it was founded (\u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1 meant \"table\" in Ancient Greek; note the table on the coin in the figure.) In Latin, Trabzon was called Trapezus, which is a latinization of its ancient Greek name. Both in Pontic Greek and Modern Greek, it is called \u03a4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 (Trapezounta). In Ottoman Turkish and Persian, it is written as \u0637\u0631\u0628\u0632\u0648\u0646. During Ottoman times, Tara Bozan was also used. Some western geographers used this name instead of the Latin Trebizond. In Laz it is known as \u10e2\u10d0\u10db\u10e2\u10e0\u10d0 (T'amt'ra) or T'rap'uzani, in Georgian it is \u10e2\u10e0\u10d0\u10de\u10d8\u10d6\u10dd\u10dc\u10d8 (T'rap'izoni) and in Armenian it is \u054f\u0580\u0561\u057a\u056b\u0566\u0578\u0576 Trapizon. The 19th-century Armenian travelling priest Byjiskian called the city by other, native names, including Hur\u015fidabat and Ozinis. Other versions of the name, which have incidentally been used in English literature as well, include: Trebizonde (Fr.), Trapezunt (German), Trebisonda (Sp.), Trapesunta (It.), Trapisonda, Tribisonde, Terabesoun, Trabesun, Trabuzan, Trabizond and Tarabossan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Iron Age and Classical Antiquity ===\n\nBefore the city was founded as a Greek colony the area was dominated by Colchian (Caucasian) and Chaldian (Anatolian) tribes. It is possible that the settlement origins of Trabzon go back to these tribes. The Hayasa, who had been in conflict with the Central-Anatolian Hittites in the 14th century BCE, are believed to have lived in the area south of Trabzon. Later Greek authors mentioned the Macrones and the Chalybes as native peoples. One of the dominant Caucasian groups to the east were the Laz, who were part of the monarchy of the Colchis, together with other related Georgian peoples.According to Greek sources the city was founded in classical antiquity in 756 BCE as T\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 (Trapezous), by Milesian traders from Sinope. It was one of a number (about ten) of Milesian emporia or trading colonies along the shores of the Black Sea. Others included Abydos and Cyzicus in the Dardanelles, and nearby Kerasous. Like most Greek colonies, the city was a small enclave of Greek life, and not an empire unto its own, in the later European sense of the word. As a colony Trapezous initially paid tribute to Sinope, but early banking (money-changing) activity is suggested occurring in the city already in the 4th century BCE, according to a silver drachma coin from Trapezus in the British Museum, London. Cyrus the Great added the city to the Achaemenid Empire, and was possibly the first ruler to consolidate the eastern Black Sea region into a single political entity (a satrapy).\n\nTrebizond's trade partners included the Mossynoeci. When Xenophon and the Ten Thousand mercenaries were fighting their way out of Persia, the first Greek city they reached was Trebizond (Xenophon, Anabasis, 5.5.10). The city and the local Mossynoeci had become estranged from the Mossynoecian capital, to the point of civil war. Xenophon's force resolved this in the rebels' favor, and so in Trebizond's interest.\nUp until the conquests of Alexander the Great the city remained under the dominion of the Achaemenids. While the Pontus was not directly affected by the war, its cities gained independence as a result of it. Local ruling families continued to claim partial Persian heritage, and Persian culture had some lasting influence on the city; the holy springs of mt. Minthrion to the east of the old town were devoted to the Persian-Anatolian Greek god Mithra. In the 2nd century BCE the city with its natural harbours was added to the Kingdom of Pontus by Pharnaces I. Mithridates VI Eupator made it the home port of the Pontic fleet, in his quest to remove the Romans from Anatolia.\nAfter the defeat of Mithridates in 66 BCE the city was first handed to the Galatians, but it was soon returned to the grandson of Mithradates, and subsequently became part of the new client Kingdom of Pontus. When the kingdom was finally annexed to the Roman province of Galatia two centuries later, the fleet passed to new commanders, becoming the Classis Pontica. The city received the status of civitas libera, extending it judicial autonomy and the right to mint its own coin. Trabzon gained importance for its access to roads leading over the Zigana Pass to the Armenian frontier or the upper Euphrates valley. New roads were constructed from Persia and Mesopotamia under the rule of Vespasian. In the next century, the emperor Hadrian commissioned improvements to give the city a more structured harbor. The emperor visited the city in the year 129 as part of his inspection of the eastern border (limes). A mithraeum now serves as a crypt for the church and monastery of Panagia Theoskepastos (K\u0131zlar Manast\u0131r\u0131) in nearby Kizlara, east of the citadel and south of the modern harbor.\n\nTrebizond was greatly affected by two events over the following centuries: in the civil war between Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger, the city suffered for its support of the latter, and in 257 the city was pillaged by the Goths, despite reportedly being defended by \"10,000 above its usual garrison\", and being defended by two bands of walls.Although Trebizond was rebuilt after being pillaged by the Goths in 257 and the Persians in 258, the city did not soon recover. Only in the reign of Diocletian appears an inscription alluding to the restoration of the city; Ammianus Marcellinus could only write of Trebizond that it was \"not an obscure town.\" Christianity had reached Trebizond by the third century, for during the reign of Diocletian occurred the martyrdom of Eugenius and his associates Candidius, Valerian, and Aquila. Eugenius had destroyed the statue of Mithras which overlooked the city from Mount Minthrion (Boztepe), and became the patron saint of the city after his death. Early Christians sought refuge in the Pontic Mountains south of the city, where they established Vazelon Monastery in 270 AD and Sumela Monastery in 386 AD. As early as the First Council of Nicea, Trebizond had its own bishop. Subsequently, the Bishop of Trebizond was subordinated to the Metropolitan Bishop of Poti. Then during the 9th century, Trebizond itself became the seat of the Metropolitan Bishop of Lazica.\n\n\n=== Byzantine period ===\n\nBy the time of Justinian, the city served as an important base in his Persian Wars, and Miller notes that a portrait of the general Belisarius \"long adorned the church of St. Basil.\" An inscription above the eastern gate of the city, commemorated the reconstruction of the civic walls following an earthquake at Justinian's expense. At some point before the 7th century the university (Pandidakterion) of the city was reestablished with a quadrivium curriculum. The university drew students not just from the Byzantine Empire, but from Armenia as well.The city regained importance when it became the seat of the theme of Chaldia. Trebizond also benefited when the trade route regained importance in the 8th to 10th centuries; 10th-century Muslim authors note that Trebizond was frequented by Muslim merchants, as the main source transshipping Byzantine silks into eastern Muslim countries. According to the 10th century Arab geographer Abul Feda it was regarded as being largely a Lazian port. The Italian maritime republics such as the Republic of Venice and in particular the Republic of Genoa were active in the Black Sea trade for centuries, using Trabzon as an important seaport for trading goods between Europe and Asia. Some of the Silk Road caravans carrying goods from Asia stopped at the port of Trebizond, where the European merchants purchased these goods and carried them to the port cities of Europe with ships. This trade provided a source of revenue to the state in the form of custom duties, or kommerkiaroi, levied on the goods sold in Trebizond. The Greeks protected the coastal and inland trade routes with a vast network of garrison forts.Following the Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, Trebizond came under Seljuk rule. This rule proved transient when an expert soldier and local aristocrat, Theodore Gabras took control of the city from the Turkish invaders, and regarded Trebizond, in the words of Anna Comnena, \"as a prize which had fallen to his own lot\" and ruled it as his own kingdom. Supporting Comnena's assertion, Simon Bendall has identified a group of rare coins he believes were minted by Gabras and his successors. Although he was killed by the Turks in 1098, other members of his family continued his de facto independent rule into the next century.\n\n\n=== Empire of Trebizond ===\n\nThe Empire of Trebizond was formed after Georgian expedition in Chaldia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople. Located at the far northeastern corner of Anatolia, it was the longest surviving of the Byzantine successor states. Byzantine authors, such as Pachymeres, and to some extent Trapezundines such as Lazaropoulos and Bessarion, regarded the Trebizond Empire as being no more than a Lazian border state. Thus from the point of view of the Byzantine writers connected with the Lascaris and later with the Palaiologos, the rulers of Trebizond were not emperors.\n\nGeographically, the Empire of Trebizond consisted of little more than a narrow strip along the southern coast of the Black Sea, and not much further inland than the Pontic Mountains. However, the city gained great wealth from the taxes it levied on the goods traded between Persia and Europe via the Black Sea. The Mongol siege of Baghdad in 1258 diverted more trade caravans towards the city. Genoese and to a lesser extent Venetian traders regularly came to Trabzon. To secure their part of the Black Sea trade, the Genoese bought the coastal fortification \"Leonkastron\", just west of the winter harbour, in the year 1306.\nOne of the most famous persons to have visited the city in this period was Marco Polo, who ended his overland return journey at the port of Trebizond, and sailed to his hometown Venice with a ship; passing by Constantinople (Istanbul) on the way, which was retaken by the Byzantines in 1261. A year earlier, in 1260, Niccol\u00f2 and Maffeo Polo (the father and uncle of Marco Polo) were residing in Constantinople, then the capital of the Latin Empire. They foresaw a political change, liquidated their assets into jewels and moved away. Their decision proved wise, as Constantinople was recaptured in 1261 by Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, who promptly burned the Venetian quarter in the city and reestablished the Byzantine Empire. Captured Venetian citizens in Constantinople were blinded, while many of those who managed to escape perished aboard overloaded refugee ships fleeing to other Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea.\n\nTogether with Persian goods, Italian traders brought stories about the city to Western Europe. Trebizond played a mythical role in European literature of the late middle-ages and the Renaissance. Miguel de Cervantes and Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais gave their protagonists the desire to possess the city. Next to literature, the legendary history of the city \u2013 and that of the Pontus in general \u2013 also influenced the creation of paintings, theatre plays and operas in Western Europe throughout the following centuries.\nThe city also played a role in the early Renaissance; The western takeover of Constantinople, which formalized Trebizond's political independence, also led Byzantine intellectuals to seek refuge in the city. Especially Alexios II of Trebizond and his grandson Alexios III were patrons of the arts and sciences. After the great city fire of 1310, the ruined university was reestablished. As part of the university Gregory Choniades opened a new academy of astronomy, which housed the best observatory outside Persia. Choniades brought with him the works of Shams al-Din al-Bukhari, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi and Abd al-Rahman al-Khazini from Tabriz, which he translated into Greek. These works later found their way to western Europe, together with the astrolabe. The observatory Choniades built would become known for its accurate solar eclipse predictions, but was probably used mostly for astrological purposes for the emperor and/or the church.The Black Death arrived at the city late 1346, probably via Kaffa. At that time the local aristocracy was engaged in the Trapezuntine Civil War. Constantinople remained the Byzantine capital until it was conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1453, who also conquered Trebizond eight years later, in 1461.\nIts demographic legacy endured for several centuries after the Ottoman conquest in 1461, as a substantial number of Greek Orthodox inhabitants, usually referred to as Pontic Greeks, continued to live in the area during Ottoman rule, up until 1923, when they were deported to Greece. A few thousand Greek Muslims still live in the area, mostly in the \u00c7aykara-Of dialectical region to the southeast of Trabzon. Most are Sunni Muslim, while there are some recent converts in the city and possibly a few Crypto-Christians in the Tonya/G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane area to the southwest of the city. Compared to most previously Greek cities in Turkey, a large amount of its Greek Byzantine architectural heritage survives as well.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nThe last Emperor of Trebizond, David, surrendered the city to Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire in 1461. Following this takeover, Mehmed II sent many Turkish settlers into the area, but the old ethnic Greek, Laz and Armenian communities remained. According to the Ottoman tax books (tahrir defterleri), the total population of adult males in the city was 1,473 in the year 1523. Approximately 85% of them (1,252 adult males) were Christian, 13% of whom (197 adult males) were Armenian, and 15% of them (221 adult males) were Muslim. However, a large portion of the local Christians were Islamized and Turkified by the end of the 17th century, according to a research by Prof. Halil \u0130nalc\u0131k on the tax books (tahrir defterleri) of the Ottoman Empire. Trabzon was sanjak centre in Rum Eyalet (1461\u20131514) and (1520\u20131535), Erzincan-Bayburt eyalet (1514\u20131517), Anadolu Eyalet (1517\u20131520) and Erzurum Eyalet (1535\u20131598).It was the capital of the Ottoman Eyalet of Trebizond (1598\u20131867) and later of the Ottoman Vilayet of Trebizond (1867\u20131923) in the northeastern part of Anatolia. During the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, his son Prince Selim (later Sultan Selim I) was the sancakbeyi of Trabzon, and Selim I's son Suleiman the Magnificent was born in Trabzon on November 6, 1494. The Ottoman government often appointed local Chepni and Laz beys as the regional beylerbey. It is also recorded that some Bosniak beys were also appointed by the Sublime Porte as the regional beylerbeys in Trabzon. The Beylerbeylik of Trabzon (Trabzon Beylerbeyli\u011fi) had always sent troops for the Ottoman campaigns in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nTrebizond had a wealthy merchant class during the late Ottoman period, and the local Christian minority had a substantial influence in terms of culture, economy and politics. A number of European consulates were opened in the city due to its importance in regional trade and commerce. In the first half of the 19th century, Trebizond even became the main port for Persian exports. However, the opening of the Suez Canal greatly diminished the international trading position of the city. In the last decades of the 19th century, the city saw some demographic changes. Many residents from the wider region (mostly Christians, but also some Jews and Greek or Turkish speaking Muslims) started to migrate to the Crimea and southern Ukraine, in search for farmland or employment in one of the booming cities along the northern and eastern coasts of the Black Sea. Among these migrants were the grandparents of Bob Dylan and Greek politicians and artists. At the same time, thousands of Muslim refugees from the Caucasus arrived in the city, especially after 1864, in what is known as the Circassian genocide.\nNext to Constantinople, Smyrna (now Izmir) and Salonika (now Thessaloniki), Trebizond was one of the cities where western cultural and technological innovations were first introduced to the Ottoman Empire. In 1835, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions opened the Trebizond Mission station that it occupied from 1835 to 1859 and from 1882 to at least 1892.  Hundreds of schools were constructed during the first half of the 19th century, giving the region one of the highest literacy rates of the empire. The city got a post office in 1845. New churches and mosques were built in the second half of the 19th century, as well as the first theater, public and private printing houses, multiple photo-studios and banks. The oldest known photographs of the city center date from the 1860s and depict one of the last camel trains from Persia.\nBetween one and two thousand Armenians are believed to have been killed in the Trebizond vilayet during the Hamidian massacres of 1895. While this number was low in comparison to other Ottoman provinces, its impact on the Armenian community in the city was large. Many prominent Armenian residents, among them scholars, musicians, photographers and painters, decided to migrate towards the Russian Empire or France. The large Greek population of the city was not affected by the massacre. Ivan Aivazovsky made the painting Massacre of the Armenians in Trebizond 1895 based on the events. Due to the high number of Western Europeans in the city, news from the region was being reported on in many European newspapers. These western newspapers were in turn also very popular among the residents of the city.\n\nOttoman era paintings and drawings of Trebizond\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1901 the harbour was equipped with cranes by Stothert & Pitt of Bath in England. In 1912 the S\u00fcmer Opera House was opened on the central Meydan square, being one of the first in the empire. The city lost many young male citizens at the Battle of Sarikamish in the winter of 1914\u201315.  The coastal region between the city and the Russian frontier was the site of key battles between the Ottoman and Russian armies during the Trebizond Campaign, part of the Caucasus Campaign of World War I. A bombardment of the city in 1915 by the Russian navy cost the lives of 1300 citizens.In July 1915, most of the adult male Armenians of the city were marched off south in five convoys, towards the mines of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane, never to be seen again. Other victims of the Armenian Genocide were reportedly taken out to sea in boats which were then capsized.The Russian army landed at Atina, east of Rize on March 4, 1916. Lazistan Sanjak fell within two days. However, due to heavy guerrilla resistance around Of and \u00c7aykara some 50 km to the east of Trabzon, it took a further 40 days for the Russian army to advance west. The Ottoman administration of Trabzon foresaw the fall of the city and called for a meeting with community leaders, where they handed control of the city to Greek metropolitan bishop Chrysantos Philippidis. Chrysantos promised to protect the Muslim population of the city. Ottoman forces retreated from Trabzon, and on April 15 the city was taken without a fight by the Russian Caucasus Army under command of Grand Duke Nicholas and Nikolai Yudenich. Many adult Turkish males left the city out of fear for reprisals, even though governor Chrysantos included them in his administration. According to some sources the Russians banned Muslim mosques, and forced Turks, who were the largest ethnic group living in the city, to leave Trabzon. However, already during the Russian occupation many Turks who had fled to surrounding villages started to return to the city, and governor Chrysantos helped them to re-establish their facilities such as schools, to the dismay of the Russians. During the Russian Revolution of 1917 Russian soldiers in the city turned to rioting, with officers commandeering Trebizonian ships to flee the scene. The Russian Army ultimately retreated from the city and the rest of eastern and northeastern Anatolia. In December 1918 Trabzon deputy Haf\u0131z Mehmet gave a speech at the Ottoman parliament in which he blamed the former governor of Trebizond Vilayet Cemal Azmi \u2013 who had fled to Germany after the Russian invasion \u2013 for orchestrating the Armenian Genocide in the city in 1915, by means of drowning. Subsequently, a series of war crimes trials were held in Trebizond in early 1919 (see Trebizond during the Armenian Genocide). Among others, Cemal Azmi was sentenced to death in absentia.\n\nDuring the Turkish War of Independence several Christian Pontic Greek communities in the Trebizond vilayet rebelled against the new army of Mustafa Kemal (notably in Bafra and Santa), but when nationalist Greeks came to Trabzon to proclaim revolution, they were not received with open arms by the local Pontic Greek population of the city. At the same time the Muslim population of the city, remembering their protection under Greek governor Crhysantos, protested the arrest of prominent Christians. Liberal delegates of Trebizond opposed the election of Mustafa Kemal as the leader of the Turkish revolution at the Erzurum Congress. The governor and mayor of Trebizond were appalled by the violence against Ottoman Greek subjects, and the government of Trabzon thus refused arms to Mustafa Kemal's henchman Topal Osman, who was responsible for mass murders in the western Pontus. Osman was forced out of the city by armed Turkish port-workers. Following the war and the annulment of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres (1920), which was replaced by the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), Trebizond became part of the new Turkish republic. The efforts of the pro-Ottoman, anti-nationalist population of Trebizond only postponed the inevitable, because the national governments of Turkey and Greece agreed to a mutual forced population exchange. This exchange included well over one hundred thousand Greeks from Trebizond and the vicinity, to the relatively new Greek state. During the war Trebizond parliamentarian Ali \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Bey was one of the leading figures of the first Turkish opposition party. Through his newspaper Tan, \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc and his colleagues publicized their critiques of the Kemalist government, such as its violence towards Greeks during the population exchange.\n\nTopal Osman's men would eventually murder parliamentarian \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc for his criticism of the nationalist government of Mustafa Kemal. Topal Osman was later sentenced to death and killed while resisting arrest. After pressure from the opposition his headless body was hanged by his foot in front of the Turkish parliament. Ali \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Bey, who had studied in Deniz Harp Okulu (Turkish Naval Academy) and worked as a journalist in the United Kingdom, is seen as a hero by the people of Trabzon, while in neighboring Giresun there is a statue of his murderer Topal Osman.\nDuring World War II shipping activity was limited because the Black Sea had again become a war zone. Hence, the most important export products, tobacco and hazelnuts, could not be sold and living standards degraded.\nAs a result of the general development of the country, Trabzon has developed its economic and commercial life. The coastal highway and a new harbour have increased commercial relations with central Anatolia, which has led to some growth. However, progress has been slow in comparison to the western and the southwestern parts of Turkey.\nTrabzon is famous throughout Turkey for its anchovies called hamsi, which are the main meal in many restaurants in the city. Major exports from Trabzon include hazelnuts and tea.\nThe city still has a sizable community of Greek-speaking Muslims, most of whom are originally from the vicinities of Tonya, S\u00fcrmene and \u00c7aykara. However, the Pontic Greek language (known as Romeiaka or \u03a0\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac, Pontiaka) is spoken mostly by the older generations.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nTrabzon Province has a total area of 4,685 square kilometres (1,809 sq mi) and is bordered by the provinces of Rize, Giresun and G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane. The total area is 22.4% plateau and 77.6% hills. The Pontic Mountains pass through the Trabzon Province.\nTrabzon used to be an important reference point for navigators in the Black Sea during harsh weather conditions. The popular expression \"perdere la Trebisonda\" (losing Trebizond) is still commonly used in the Italian language to describe situations in which the sense of direction is lost. The Italian maritime republics such as Venice and in particular Genoa were active in the Black Sea trade for centuries.Trabzon has four lakes: Uzung\u00f6l, \u00c7ak\u0131rg\u00f6l, Sera and Haldizen Lakes. There are several streams, but no rivers in Trabzon.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTrabzon has a climate typical of the Black Sea region with plentiful precipitation. Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, it has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa) Summers are warm and humid, and the average maximum temperature is around 26.7 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F) in August. Winters are cool and damp, and the lowest average minimum temperature is around 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F) in January. Trabzon's summers are warmer than oceanic classifications, but the narrow fluctuations in temperature render a significant influence from the sea. As with other major cities on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, Trabzon is situated right on the waterfront, thus allowing for the additional 1\u20132 \u00b0C (1.8\u20133.6 \u00b0F) enough to surpass the threshold to be classified as subtropical. In comparison, only 1 or 2 percent of the province is classified as subtropical, the majority being oceanic (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) followed by humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfb), due to the immediate elevation increase starting from the coast, a typical characteristic of the Black Sea coast of Turkey. The Pontic Alps get a significant amount of snow during winters. The temperatures may drop as low as -30 \u00b0C (-22 \u00b0F). In some places the snow can stay on the ground during summer months. Trabzon's weather station also sees tendencies of a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa), but with only one month below 40 mm (1.6 in) rainfall in summer it just fails to qualify.\nPrecipitation is heaviest in autumn and winter, with a marked reduction in the summer months, a microclimatic condition of the city center compared to the rest of the region. Snowfall is quite common between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two, and it can be heavy once it snows.\nThe water temperature, like in the rest of the Black Sea coast of Turkey, is always cool and fluctuates between 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) and 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) throughout the year.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAs of 1920, the port at Trabzon was considered \"the most important of the Turkish Black Sea ports\" by the British. It traded as far as Tabriz and Mosul. As of 1911, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey signed an agreement to develop a harbor at the port. When the Russians occupied Trabzon, a mole was built. They built a breakwater and were responsible for creating an extended pier, making loading and unloading easier. In 1920, Trabzon produced linen cloth, silver filagree, tanning and small amounts of cotton, silk and wool. Tobacco and hazelnuts were exported. The tobacco produced in Trabzon was called Trebizond-Platana. It was described as having \"large leaves and a bright colour.\" Trabzon was known for producing poor quality cereals, most which were grown for local use.Trabzon produced a white green bean, which was sold in Europe. It was, as of 1920, the only vegetable exported out of the province. Poultry farming was also popular in Trabzon. Sericulture was seen in the area before 1914. The area produced copper, silver, zinc, iron and manganese. Copper was kept for local use by coppersmiths. During the Balkan Wars production ceased due to poor exportation and fuel supplies.Trabzon Airport opened in 1957.\n\n\n== People ==\n\nThe current ethnic background of the people of Trabzon is mostly Turkish. There are also descendants of Circassian muhajiris in the city, as well as smaller number of Laz people, Muslim Greeks (Romeyka-speakers) and Armenians (Hemshin). Local Turks are mostly of Chepni Turkmen origin. The main language of these ethnic groups is Turkish. Modern migration since the dissolution of the Soviet Union has brought a significant number of Russians, Ukrainians and people from the Caucasus (mostly Georgia) into the city. Russian language shops and facilities can be found in the town.\nPontic Greek has been spoken in the region since early antiquity. The local dialect developed along its own lines and is today partly intelligible to speakers of Standard Greek. It was spoken mainly by a Greek Orthodox multi-ethnic population up to the population exchange; nearly all speakers of this local variant of Pontic Greek are now Muslims. A very similar dialect is spoken by a community of about 400 speakers, descendants of Christians from the Of valley now living in Greece in the village of Nea Trapezounta (New Trebizond), today part of Katerini, Central Macedonia.Laz people, who are aboriginal to this area, also live in Trabzon. Numerous villages inside and out of Trabzon of the Laz date back as early as the period of Queen Tamar's rule (Georgian: \u10d7\u10d0\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8, also transliterated as T'amar or Thamar; c. 1160 \u2013 18 January 1213) in the newly unified Kingdom of Georgia. During the Queen's rule, sizeable groups of immigrating Georgians moved to Trabzon where they continue to preserve their native tongue. There was an Armenian community in Trebizond as early as the 7th century.During the 13th and 14th centuries, numerous Armenian families migrated there from Ani. Robert W. Edwards published part of an early 15th-century diary from the Castilian ambassador who visited Trabzon and compared the churches of the Greek and Armenian communities.  It was stated by the ambassador that the Armenians, who were not well-liked by the Greeks, had a population large enough to support a resident bishop.  According to Ronald C. Jennings, in the early 16th century, Armenians made up approximately 13 percent of the city's population. At present, Trabzon does not have an Armenian-speaking community.\nThe Chepni people, a tribe of Oghuz Turks who played an important role in the history of the eastern Black Sea area in the 13th and 14th centuries, live in the \u015ealpazar\u0131 (A\u011fasar valley) region of the Trabzon Province. Very little has been written on the Turkification of the area. There are no historical records of any considerable Turkish-speaking groups in the Trabzon area until the late 15th century, with the exception of the Chepnis. The original Greek (and in some regions Armenian) speakers imposed features from their mother language into the Turkish spoken in the region. Heath W. Lowry's work with Halil \u0130nalc\u0131k on Ottoman tax books (Tahrir Defteri) provides detailed demographic statistics for the city of Trabzon and its surrounding areas during the Ottoman period.\nIt is possible that the majority of the population of Trabzon and Rize (and other ancient Greek colonies in the Pontus region) \u2014 except up to the time of the Chepni Turk immigration waves \u2014 consisted of indigenous Caucasian tribes (the Colchians and the Laz) who had been partly Hellenized religiously and linguistically. Michael Meeker stresses the cultural resemblances (e.g. in village structure, house types, and pastoral techniques) between the Eastern Black Sea coast and the areas in the Caucasus proper.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nTrabzon has a number of tourist attractions, some of them dating back to the times of the ancient empires that once existed in the region. In the city itself, one can find a hub of shops, stalls and restaurants surrounding the Meydan, a square in the center of the city, which includes a tea garden.\n\nThe Hagia Sophia (Turkish: Ayasofya M\u00fczesi), a stunning Byzantine church, is probably the town's most important tourist attraction.\nTrabzon Castle ruins are visible in the town but cannot be visited as they fall in a military zone.  The outside wall of the castle now serves as the back wall of a military building.\nThe \"Atat\u00fcrk K\u00f6\u015fk\u00fc\" is a villa built in 1890 by a local Greek merchant. In 1924 Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk stayed in the villa during his visit to Trabzon. He stayed there again in 1937. It houses period rooms and serves as a monument to the memory of the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey.\nBoztepe Park is a small park and tea garden on the hills above Trabzon that has a panoramic view of nearly the entire city. The terrain in Trabzon is ascending in such a way that although the view is far above that of the buildings below, it is still close enough to be able to observe the flow of traffic and the people moving about in the city.\nUzun Sokak is one of the most crowded streets of Trabzon.\nTrabzon Museum is located in the town centre and offers interesting exhibits on the history of the region, including an impressive collection of Byzantine artifacts.\nTrabzon's Bazaar District offers interesting shopping opportunities on ancient narrow streets, continuing from Kundurac\u0131lar Street from the Meydan (town square).\nKostaki Mansion is located to the north of Zeytinlik near Uzun Sokak.Other sites of the city include: Fatih Mosque (originally the Panagia Khrysokephalos Church), Yeni Cuma Mosque (originally the Agios Eugenios Church), Nakip Mosque (originally the Agios Andreas Church), H\u00fcsn\u00fc K\u00f6ktu\u011f Mosque (originally the Agios Elevtherios Church), \u0130skender Pasha Mosque, Semerciler Mosque, \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 Mosque, G\u00fclbahar Hatun Mosque and T\u00fcrbe (commissioned by Sultan Selim I), Kalepark (originally Leonkastron).\nWithin Trabzon Province, the main attractions are the S\u00fcmela Monastery (i. e. the Monastery of the Panagia Soumel\u00e1) and the Uzung\u00f6l lake. The monastery is built on the side of a very steep mountain overlooking the green forests below and is about 50 kilometres (31 miles) south of the city. Uzung\u00f6l is known for its natural environment and scenery. Other sites of interest in the broader region include:\n\nKaymakl\u0131 Monastery, a formerly Armenian Monastery of the All-Saviour (arm. \u0531\u0574\u0565\u0576\u0561\u0583\u0580\u056f\u056b\u0579 \u054e\u0561\u0576\u0584, Amenaprgi\u010d Vank),\nK\u0131zlar Monastery of Panagia Theoskepastos (the God-veiled Virgin),\nKu\u015ftul Monastery of Gregorios Peristereotas (gr. \u0399\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac \u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1, Ier\u00e1 Mon\u00ed tou Ag\u00edou Georg\u00edou Peristere\u00f3ta),\nVazelon Monastery of Agios Savvas (Ma\u015fatl\u0131k),\nCave churches of Agia Anna (Little Ayvas\u0131l), Sotha (St. John), Agios Theodoros, Agios Konstantinos, Agios Christophoros, Agia Kyriak\u00ed, Agios Michail and Panagia Tzita churches.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nFolk dancing is still very much in evidence in the Black Sea region. The \"Horon\" is a famous dance that is indigenous to the city and its surrounding area. It is performed by men, women, the young and elderly alike; in festivities, local weddings and harvest times. While similar to Russian Cossack dances in terms of vividness, the Trabzon folk dance is probably indigenous to the eastern Black Sea region, which has an impressive variety of folk music.\nThe people of Trabzon have a reputation for being religiously conservative and nationalist. Many Trabzonites generally show a strong sense of loyalty to their family, friends, religion and country. Atat\u00fcrk selected his presidential guards from Trabzon and the neighbouring city of Giresun because of their fierce fighting ability and their loyalty.\nOutside of the relatively urban space of Trabzon proper, and within parts of it as well, rural traditions from the Black Sea village life are still thriving. These include traditional gender roles, social conservatism, hospitality and a willingness to help strangers; and all aspects, both positive and negative, of an agrarian lifestyle, such as hard work, poverty, strong family ties, and a closeness to nature.\nThe people of the eastern Black Sea region are also known for their wit and sense of humour; many jokes in Turkey are told about the natives of the Black Sea region Karadeniz f\u0131kralar\u0131 (Black Sea jokes). The character Temel, a universal buffoon figure found in many cultures, forms an important part of the Turkish oral tradition.\nThe city's profile was raised somewhat in the English-speaking world by Dame Rose Macaulay's last novel, The Towers of Trebizond (1956), which is still in print.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nBlack Sea Technical University in Trabzon hosts students from all over Turkey, especially from the Black Sea and East Anatolian regions, as well as students from the Turkic states in Central Asia.\nHistorically the city was a center of Greek culture and education and from 1683 to 1921, a teachers' college operated known as Phrontisterion of Trapezous, which provided a major impetus for the rapid expansion of Greek education throughout the region. The building of this institution (built in 1902) still remains the most impressive Pontic Greek monument in the city and today hosts the Turkish school Anadolu Lisesi.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nTrabzon's regional cuisine is traditionally reliant on fish, especially hamsi (fresh European Anchovy similar to the British Sprat or American Smelt). Trabzon meets 20% of the total fish production in Turkey. Regional dishes include the Ak\u00e7aabat k\u00f6fte (spicy lamb meatball from the Ak\u00e7aabat district), Karadeniz pidesi (canoe shaped pita bread, often filled with ground beef, cheese and eggs), kuymak (a Turkish fondue made with cornmeal, fresh butter and cheese), Vakf\u0131kebir ekme\u011fi (large country-style bread), Tonya tereya\u011f\u0131 (Tonya butter), tava m\u0131s\u0131r ekme\u011fi (deep-dish corn bread) and kara lahana \u00e7orbas\u0131 (bean and cabbage soup). Taflan kavurmas\u0131 is a cherry laurel dish served with onions and olive oil. Trabzon is also famous for its hazelnuts. The Black Sea region of Turkey is the world's largest producer of cherry and hazelnut; and a large production area of tea; all of which play an important role in the local cuisine.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Trabzon. The city's top sports club, Trabzonspor, was until 2010 the only Turkish football club outside \u0130stanbul to win the S\u00fcper Lig (six times), which was previously (until Trabzonspor's first championship title in the 1975\u201376 season) won only by the \"Big Three\" clubs of Istanbul, namely Galatasaray, Fenerbah\u00e7e and Be\u015fikta\u015f. Due to Trabzonspor's success, the decades-old term \"Big Three\" which defined the most successful football clubs in Turkey had to be modified into the \"Big Four\". \nTrabzonspor is also one of the most successful Turkish clubs in the European Cups, managing to beat numerous prominent teams such as Barcelona, Inter, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Olympique Lyonnais. Renowned former players of Trabzonspor include \u015eenol G\u00fcne\u015f, Lars Olsen and Shota Arveladze.\nTrabzon hosted the First Edition of the Black Sea Games in July 2007 and the 2011 European Youth Summer Olympic Festival.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nTrabzon is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmasya (ancient Amaseia, capital of the Pontic Greeks during classical antiquity)\nAnatolian Tigers\nBlack Sea Region\nKemen\u00e7e of the Black Sea\nKolbast\u0131\nWorld Trade Center Trabzon\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\nPrinceton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites eds.

He grew up in the small beach community of Longport, New Jersey and graduated from Atlantic City High School in 1973. Paul began working as an architect in his father Edgar's architectural practice before graduating from Clemson University in 1977. He was employed by Wasleski Steelman, the city of Atlantic City, Golden Nugget Atlantic City Corporation and Resorts International, Atlantic City. In 1987 he founded his own firm.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nSteelman worked on Steve Wynn's Mirage hotel which in 1989 became the first Strip hotel to focus on eating and entertainment in addition to gaming tables. Since then, he has worked on numerous projects, often in collaboration with casino developers.\nIn 1987 he founded his own architectural firm, Paul Steelman LTD, in Las Vegas, Nevada. His design mentors were Joel Bergman and Henry Conversano. The firm, now called Steelman Partners, owns and operates several other design companies including DSAA (interior design), Shop12 (lighting, theater, ride and attraction design), Inviro Studios (film animations), MARQI (branding and corporate identity), Competition Interactive (slot machine design and manufacturer), Steelman Development (commercial real estate), Steelman Aviation (airplane charter and management), and PCEG (EB5 Regional Center).\nSteelman Partners has offices in Las Vegas, Nevada; Macau PRC; Zhuhai PRC; Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; and Amsterdam, Netherlands.Paul Steelman and his firm have designed many casino projects around the world that include the following: Sands Macau; Four Seasons Macau; City of Dreams Shopping Center Macau; Hard Rock Casino Macau; Galaxy Macau; Harrahs, California; Harrahs AK-Chin, Arizona; Harrahs Tunica, Mississippi; Harrahs Vicksburg, Mississippi; Harrahs Kansas City; Caesar's Indiana; Caesars Magical Empire, Las Vegas; JW Marriott, Las Vegas; Showboat, Las Vegas; Stratosphere, Las Vegas; Casinos Locarno, Switzerland; Thun Casino, Switzerland; Casino Rheinfelden, Switzerland; Swiss Casino Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Casino St Gallen, Switzerland;  MGM Casino and Theme Park, Las Vegas; Treasure Island Expansions and Renovations, Las Vegas; Beau Rivage, Mississippi, Hard Rock Biloxi, Mississippi, Foxwoods Resort Casino, Connecticut; Showboat Atlantic City, New Jersey; Steel Pier Atlantic City, New Jersey; Solaire Resort & Casino, Philippines; Sochi Casino, Russia; Grand Casino Riviera, France; Casino Grand Via, Spain; Grand Casino, Finland; The Grand Ho Tram, Vietnam; Star Gold Coast, Australia; Seminole Casino, Florida; Sun City Entertainment Center, South Africa, The Casino at the Empire, London; London Clubs, Bahamas; Nagaworld, Cambodia.Currently Steelman is designing Resorts World Las Vegas; Circa Resort and Casino; Casino Van Dom, Vietnam; Naga 3 at NagaWorld, Cambodia; Imperial Pacific, Saipan; Lotus Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam; Genting Malaysia Master Plan; Galaxy Media Center, Macau; Galaxy 1000 Room Hotel, Macau; Naga Vladivostok; and Scotts Valley Casino in California.Steelman worked for billionaire Phil Ruffin on designing the a 2,750-room casino called the Montreux, an entertainment property modeled after a Swiss-themed lakefront hotel which includes a 465-foot-tall observation wheel which \"scoops riders from the floor above the casino,\" according to a report in Forbes magazine. The design's interior was a \"mix of glass artwork, waterfalls and reflective surfaces,\" similar to boutique hotels in New York or Los Angeles, according to a report in the Las Vegas Sun. Steelman's firm designed a $6.2 billion tourism development in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in 2010. A reporter commented on his design style:\n\nSteelman is wiser than most when it comes to the logistics of moving gamblers through sin dens ... Steelman has, over the last 20 years, come up with 70-odd design rules to keep visitors in a gleeful state as they evenly spread their dollars among betting tables, shops, theaters and restaurants.\nOne Steelman design invention was a sleek transformable ballroom inside a casino that can undergo several makeovers within a single day, enabling event organizers to use the space for different purposes, and transform it in less than two hours:\n\nHold a fashion show in the morning, a poker tournament in the afternoon and a boxing match at night. The ideal length for any spectacle in a casino is less than 90 minutes.\nSteelman received a gaming manufacturing and distribution license from the State of Nevada on February 23, 2017 for his subsidiary company, Competition Interactive LLC. Competition Interactive has designed a new skill based slot machine named Running Rich Racing, which will be placed in casinos in 2017.Steelman's firm has employed architects who later founded their own architecture firms, such as Gemie Knisely of GK3 and Kim Daoust and Jordan Ba\u00f1ares of Tandem.

          "Very nice!  Front desk was helpful and fast. Rooms were modern.  Casino was big and had a good selection.  The food at the on site restaurant was very good.  Would definitely recommend.",

          "Had a great time last week. Finally felt normal. Only about 10% of people chose to wear masks. Now you expect everyone to wear a mask or be asked to leave. No thank you. Not going to come back until mask requirement lifted. It should be my choice. If masks protect people so well...people that wear one should be protected from me.",
          "One of my favorite Casinos to go to. Great outside pool. Very good restaurants. Just remodeled their sports betting which is awesome. People so nice! Would definitely recommend!!",
          "Beautiful! So much more than a casino. This is a resort at its finest. Lots of shops and eateries.  Almost looks like a mini mall inside. Beautifully decorated! Tons of seating as you are walking thru to the casino floor. If you haven't visited this place I highly recommend.  You will not be disappointed!",

          "Always a great time... Best time to go right now is between 2:00am-7:00am as there is almost no people in the casino at this time and the workers are finally cleaning. So this greatly lowers your chances of getting this corona virus. On the \u2026",

          "Carpet and interior is getting dated.  The steakhouse restaurant was not anything up to the standards of Vic & Anthony's at Lake Charles Golden Nugget except the same prices!   Charged a high price for a meal that would have been better at Ruth Chris steakhouse in my humble opinion.",

          "Return of the casinos you think would be great.  Hold off and stay at home.  No winners here.  They are definitely trying to make up for lost time and money.....on the backs of the patrons willing to come out.  Stay home.  Felt like they turned off the slot machines to pay zero dollars.",

          "Great food. Slots are easier closer to weekend and holidays. Otherwise expect to pay a lot for that free drink. If staying overnight, bring your own blanket. The ones provided are very flimsy.",
          "I feel that most of these casinos are doing the best they can to accommodate everyone but I can't afford to play table games here or any other casino we've went to . Only 3 can play on table and minimum bets are 15 bucks and only about 1/4 of the slots are available to play. Food is still fantastic !",

          "Beautiful place to visit exclent casino floor, I would have to say it's definitely a 5 star casino.",
          "We Love this place for my Mom and Hubby's birthday during the Summer. Access to Beach, Casino is ALOT of Fun. My son has fun at Pool, and I enjoy relaxing. Hope to see you guys in June 2021 for my Mom's 65th birthday.",
          "The beds are like heaven! Service was good. Everything was clean and nice. Had a great time. Oh...except the buffet wasn't great. The hostess was a little curt and our table was given to someone else when we went  to get our food, but the \u2026",
          "Beautiful lobby with bunch of flowers decorations...Most of the stores and restaurants included The Buffet are still closed due to Covid19...Casino & the hotel are open...a lot less patrons than usual for a beautiful weekend on the summer holidays...a lot of people on the beaches  : )",
          "The food was really good. The best I've had at a casino. The game room is a little pricey for what it is. The decorations are always on point especially at Christmas time. I make a trip at least once a month to go eat and play.",
          "The Beau is a beautiful property.  Not sure if the dealers were just having bad days but I dont like sitting down at a table and hearing, No this is not the table with the bonus it is over there, thats the table everybody wants.  I never \u2026",
          "Been a Pearl member 4 yrs. They just blew a siren and kicked everyone out of the pool because of a chance of rain. Last September we all drank in the pool in a rain storm. At present we are in room watching rain pass by about 3 miles North \u2026",
          "Beautiful property and amenities!  875 bar server Trenay was amazing and very attentive ...a true professional when it comes to customer service.  The valet attendant Blake was extremely courteous, dressed well and had perfect manners... \u2026",
          "Beautiful casino.  Great air filtration as well.  They allow smoking, but it doesn't smell like an ashtray.   Had a great meal at the Italian restaurant.   Definitely worth a trip.",
          "For example... After tipping a dealer around $100 as I played, he acted offended and told me as i left that  I was playing too slow. No one else was at the table....jerk. \n\nMost of the dealers are actually pretty good,  but a third were not. I expect better.",
          "Still just as beautiful as the first time I went. I can't wait to go back to the Beau!",
          "I love to stay at hotel of Beau Rivage Resort.  I plan to see Chicago in concert in March and then Celtic women in April.  The food is wonderful.  The spa and resort by pool and sea is relaxing.",
          "We made a trip over for the weekend and for the fight. While at the other casino, we were not able to get served by a single waitress. Within maybe 10 minutes we had a waitress coming up behind us after we started playing. The new player \u2026",
          "The pool bar continues to be a disappointment. It takes entirely too long to order a drink. My husband's beer was warm and my margarita was awful. Will try a different hotel/casino next time we stay in Biloxi.",
          "BEAUTIFUL place to stay. Definitely recommend, only thing is if you dont have reservations GOOD LUCK ARGUING WITH SECURITY because for some godforsaken reason you cant park your car for 5 minutes while you check in \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd2d\ud83d\udcaf",

          "It was very nice and classy. There was app a lot to do in both the casino and resort.",
          "Our second time at the Beau Rivage. This time they went out of their way to make our stay amazing. After a long drive from Washington State, this was great. We were upgraded to the Cypress Suite as our comp room for the night. Add 150 in \u2026",
          "Went to the lunch buffet. The choices were mediocre at best. Definitely not worth $15 per person. Amazing table service though.",
          "The staff questioned me as if I shouldn\u2019t have been there several times! For the price,the room was somewhat small & it had no microwave or refrigerator!! I will say the room was clean.",
          "Ayla made it a pleasant day with her extraordinary customer service.",

          "This was the first time we stayed at the hotel, we had been to the casino before. The hotel is beautiful and so clean, the rooms were very nice and also clean and fresh. We enjoyed the brunch before we left the next morning and that is a 5 star review in itself. We will be back again!",
          "Great place to gamble. Beautiful scenery inside. We were there the day before they shut down due to the virus. Will miss being able to go there ib next few weeks.",
          "The food on the buffet is not that good. The service was good though. When I was playing the slots, I had to wait forever for a waitress to show up to bring me a drink. She was very friendly though and it really wasn't her fault. She was \u2026",
          "We went to the Christmas in the Air show and went to Terrace Cafe afterwards. I can say that we definitely enjoyed ourselves here. My daughter was dancing and singing during the whole show and myself and husband enjoyed the show. My son is \u2026",
          "The lady at the front desk was amazing last night at 3am. I played poker all night and ended up needing a room. Many of the other hotels wouldn\u2019t work with me because it was so late. The beau comped next a room so I could sleep peacefully \u2026",
          "Beaux Rivage is great, smells nice inside and wonderful service and gaming floor.",
          "Had a great time the only thing is I didn't get but 1 drink in 3 hours an I had to go look for her",
          "Second time e experiencing the casino.  Service is above average.  The food at the buffett was good.  The wife won on the slots so I would have to give the gambling a thumbs up.",
          "This is for that one person researching who wonders if things have changed after Covid? The answer is 100% Yes! I normally go about five times a year to The Beau Rivage. I booked a three night stay July 3-6th and lost all my gambling money \u2026",
          "Love it first time going. Gives you free play for new comers.",
          "Had a great time. Food was delicious. Staff very accommodating. Wonderful shops in hotel. I was able to enjoy the sunrise and sunset from my room.",
          "My how the mighty have fallen! I used to tell people if you wanted to gamble in Biloxi you need to go to the Beau rivage, it was the Bellagio of the gulf coast. Not anymore \n\nDuring the shut down you think they would\u2019ve done something to \u2026",
          "We had a fantastic time here! The atmosphere and surroundings are upscale and clean and the staff is really friendly. The food is good, you can get four-star dining at the steakhouse or other restaurants, or you can get snack bar or diner \u2026",
          "Much fun was had by all! Beautiful pool area, great restaurant choices. The ventilation could be better on the casino floor, but they do have a non-smoking area which is nice! Friendly employees \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Stopped in for a weekend overnight trip and found that some areas of the casino were deplorable in terms of maintenance and cleanliness.  I get the feeling that the maintenance staff is trying to hold together a dated infrastructure.  The \u2026",
          "This is the best gaming and hotel in Mississippi food is #1 in this town.can't wait to return!!!",
          "Employees were nice, room was clean and relaxing, and the amount of attractions and restaurants in the hotel was great but, my only complaint was that there was a man in the hallway (who seemed to be drunk) on my floor knocking on different \u2026",
          "We ate at the Terrace Cafe in the front of the hotel on 12/27/19 and our experience was wonderful.  The food was plentiful and tasted superb.  But the best part of the meal was the service we received.  Our server was Kelly P and she was \u2026",
          "Surprised there weren\u2019t enough amenities facecloths for a room that accommodates 4. Ie coffee, linens, water, etc.",
          "Well, it's a casino, it's in Biloxi,MS. of all places, kinda like Las Vegas but on warfare. It's a good enough casino, clean, never really all that busy and the food ain't to bad but for the price could be better. In short, got some extra \u2026",
          "Had fun at the slots!(could have won a little more, hint, hint) Buffet could be a little fresher! Hadn't been in 20 years. Do a lot of \nVegas m-life. I will go back to both..great atmosphere!",
          "I received a free flight down to Biloxi (from Chicago) and stayed four nights at the Beau Rivage.  The customer service is amazing. Every employee I interacted with was so polite and professional and seemingly wanted to go out of their way to help. Seriously, a top notch staff.",
          "Really nice place.. great restaurants.  Really nice rooms.  Only downside is the prices for little things, just no reason a cup of coffee should cost $4, but beside that we really had a great time",
          "Would love to go back and play again,lost but we had a good time loosing it. ( Lol ) Now the Buffet was Excellent,to die for. Also All the Free Drinks you can handle while Playing.",
          "Beau feels catered to lower middle class who thinks they're upper middle or deserve more than they have. Mediocre food at lavish restaurant prices, dated decor meant to WOW a certain generation that's no longer the majority. Don't get me wrong, it is a nice place. Just seems to be behind on the times.",
          "Awesome. Hands down the nicest casino on the coast. Clubs are top notch. Plenty of table action and all the best slots. 2 \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "It's ok but definitely not worth the four hour drive.",
          "I like the casino and the inside of property. Stores are very nice. Atmosphere is awesome. I use to come by when Steve owned it.Still very beautiful. Will try to schedule again thanks.",
          "Beautifully decorated every season. Large Casino floor, lots of venues but again limited do to pandemic.",
          "Nice place, great sports bar, nice steak joint and hibachi restaurants. Lots of high limit slots for the floor space for those who prefer them as well. Drink service was good to very good depending where you were sitting but typical MGM ABINBEV floor beers unfortunately.",
          "I did not stay in a room there but came to play in the casino. The staff is very helpful but I wanted to highlight a wonderful employee named Alesha. Alesha is a Restroom attendant that greeted everyone with a big smile and kind words to \u2026",
          "So beautifully decorated for the Christmas holidays but light all casinos tight slots. I use to go 2 or 3 times a year and at least win play back to keep you playing but no more. The rooms are beautiful the service is great.",
          "Beautiful hotel and friendly staff.  BR Prime was awesome both food and service, Terrace Cafe has a limited menu but the food and service was good, but Dinner Buffet left much to be desired.  Not much to do unless you want to gamble all day \u2026",
          "This hotel location is great! The food & drinks are very expensive. Way over priced. Friendly staff.  The rooms are good size but the beds need replacing. The bedding isn\u2019t fitted & sheets don\u2019t stay in place. The mattress are so old that \u2026",
          "Smells good. Orderly. Lots of security. Good games. But details are starting to show their age. Could use a major maintenance going over.",

          "All around fun and excitement win or lose great fun and smiles everywhere",
          "I love the atmosphere here.  It's so beautiful inside. They have many restaurant offerings but I always end up at the snack shop. Best egg salad and pasta salad side on the coast! A little pricey but the quality is excellent.  Planning on trying Stalla (italian) on my next trip.",
          "We had stayed at another casino Hotel on Thursday.Their bed was too hard.  Beau Rivage had a nicer bed .  But I did not love the pillows. But we all enjoyed our rooms.Clean spacious and Very Quiet. Great view.",
          "Since we were there at a bad time, many things were shut down but still a fun trip.  Just wish we has a better beach view.",
          "This is a hidden gem, lots of slits and plenty of tables. Pleasant enough dealers and some really good high end food. The buffet was a tad bit weak but the steak house and the Italian restaurant were both excellent. I highly recommend them \u2026",
          "Excellent service & accommodations! Quick & easy check in. Room service food wasn't the best and the wait time was 50 mins for a wine bottle opener, but the resort itself made up for that. The valet and room service attendants were top notch. Will definitely return!",
          "What an awesome place to spend our Christmas Eve. This casino was by far the most festive and wonderful with holiday sents to boot. A wonderful photo op for any family. The staff was friendly. You did not have to hunt for a waitress to be served. Many shops that give you a break from gaming. Just an overall wonderful experience.",
          "My wife and I didn't stay here but visited the casino. We would definitely consider staying there though. Our gaming experience was a good one for sure, we were entertained for hours. Thumbs up and we would recommend it.",
          "We always enjoy visiting the Beau Rivage. There are lots of gambling and eating options, or just for a walk thru on the way to one of their spectacular shows. We often meet-at-the-Beau.",

          "Hillary at the front desk made our stay amazing!\n\nWe have stayed at this property several times and each time have had a fantastic experience. First of all, I need to give credit to \"Hillary\" at the front desk. She has always made us feel \u2026",
          "Awesome. Everything was perfect. Staff was friendly, courteous, helpful and seemed to want your stay to be a great experience. Can't wait to go back. Ps Terrace cafe was wonderful and delicious and the servings were huge.",
          "I recommend this place. I love the stay. The rooms were amazing. The slots an tables are awesome. Service is great. Beautiful surroundings...all the above.",
          "My self and a friend went to eat the buffet on Sunday the 16th of Feb. The food was sub-par at best, the breakfast items were almost all undercooked and or cold.\n\nThe price was 25$ a person, and honestly I could have gotten more food for \u2026"

        "wiki": "German Americans (German: Deutschamerikaner) are citizens of the United States of German ancestry; they form the largest ethnic ancestry group in the United States, accounting for 17% of U.S. population. The first significant numbers arrived in the 1680s in New York and Pennsylvania. Some eight million German immigrants have entered the United States since that point. Immigration continued in substantial numbers during the 19th century; the largest number of arrivals moved 1840\u20131900, when Germans formed the largest group of immigrants coming to the U.S., outnumbering the Irish and English. Some arrived seeking religious or political freedom, others for economic opportunities greater than those in Europe, and others for the chance to start afresh in the New World. California and Pennsylvania have the largest populations of German origin, with more than six million German Americans residing in the two states alone. More than 50 million people in the United States identify German as their ancestry; it is often mixed with other Northern European ethnicities. This list also includes people of German Jewish descent.\nAmericans of German descent live in nearly every American county, from the East Coast, where the first German settlers arrived in the 17th century, to the West Coast and in all the states in between. German Americans and those Germans who settled in the U.S. have been influential in almost every field, from science, to architecture, to entertainment, and to commercial industry.\n\n\n== Art and literature ==\n\n\n=== Architects ===\nDankmar Adler \u2013 architect\nAugust H.

          "These photos have been taken in Krunska Street near Nikola Tesla Museum. There are mainly nice houses with gardens. As for the Nikola Tesla Museum, there's not enough space here to describe what can be seen there, but it's definitely a \u2026",
          "The tour was conducted in Serbian. If you have some understanding of electricity then it's mostly self-explained.\nThere was a limited number of visitors per tour. If the tour's full then you have to wait for the next one in one hour.",
          "It's not very big, but has some very interesting genuine old exhibits of generators etc and a few cool interactive exhibits, such as the 500kv lightning generator which is impressive.\nCouldn't hear the tour guide cos of mask.\nPrice only 500dinars which is very good.",
          "It was a very pleasant experience, the price is affordable, the staff is friendly and they give you information about the inventions and demonstrate experiments which you can participate. The museum is small but I think it is enough to \u2026",
          "The museum is a bit small. In a beautiful building. With the ticket you get to see a film about Tesla life and a guided tour by a very friendly and informative guide that shows you through some basic Tesla coils experiments, which most of the people will find amazing. The guide helped us having a wonderful \"popular science\" experience.",
          "I have visited this city last December and I was overwhelmed by its historical museums and architectures. Had I known how fascinating they were , I would have extend my holidays and spend more time learning about the history \nMuseum is \u2026",
          "Nice little museum depicting the life and work of Nikola Tesla, the Serbian genius best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. The tour starts with a 15 minutes film, \u2026",
          "Nikola Tesla is one of the most important scientist throughout history, this museum is not...\n\nVery large group and it was not possible to see what the (well spoken) guide was pointing at or demonstrating. There are very few items on \u2026",
          "Not very big but very informative museum with nice guides inside. Worth to spend your time there. Only minus there is no public WC inside.",
          "Guide was knowledgeable. Fun to see the experiments and video. Small and the coverage was limited to the high points in his life. A more balanced portrayal would have made it even better.",
          "Absolutely astounding experience from the history to his inventions. This muesuem is small in statue but gigantic with wealth of knowledge and insight. Powerful place and I recommend they design a replica to add to the National Mall in Washington D.C.",
          "Definitely an authentic and interesting experience! We decided to go even before we were in Belgrade, and I must say that I am really glad. The guided tour was great, guide speaks English pretty well. The tour itself was interactive, you \u2026",
          "This is a museum that everybody in the world should visit because it is dedicated to one of the greatest minds of mankind - Nikola Tesla. There are interesting exhibits and experiments where visitors can participate. It's so interesting \u2026",
          "The museum itself is pretty small but nice to visit. Movie about Tesla's life is very interesting and is the first thing you'll see when visiting. It's nice to be able to see his inventions and learn a bit more about how they function as \u2026",
          "The overall efforts to make this museum interesting was good but overall it\u2019s a small museum and a bit uneventful. It was great to learn about him though there\u2019s only so much you can do to make this fun.",
          "I was beyond amazed of what in found in this unique and only museum of onw of the grate minds of mankind.\nThe tour inside is guided by a very knowledgeable and actual electrical engineer. The video and experiments they performed are an \u2026",
          "It was quite informative, and I enjoyed interacting with Tesla's actual inventions. However, despite the outside appearance, the actual museum area was quite small. And though the video shown was impressive, I could've seen a similar video \u2026",
          "I would expect more. It's very small, you have to wait outside until entries are allowed again. You have to take the guided tour (included in the ticket) otherwise it's not worth it. They need to rearrange the place and make it more interesting and exciting. Too much buzz about it but not really what you expect.",
          "Excellent presentation by the guide that truly makes a visit to an otherwise rather small museum truly worth your time. And English language tours are held rather often, as I understood it.",
          "A bit smaller than expected, the guide was great, however. No toilets.",
          "Amazing!!! You get to see a discharge of a 500 thousand volt Tesla coil and to know about the man and the genious!!!\nHighly recommended!\nTip: Park at the Hilton Hotel underground parking. It's close by!\nLoved it!",
          "There will never be enough words and ways to express the amount of gratitude and respect to Nikola Tesla who has so many things possible for us today. The master mind and visit to this museum dedicated to him is good to give us a glimpse of what he had done for us and what genius he was and yet so humble and down to earth person.",
          "Interesting museum to visit while in Belgrade, isn't big but the price is only 500Rsd(about 5 American dollars) the total visit is about 30 - 50 min. The first part of the visit is shown a video of about 15 min about Nikola Tesla life, then \u2026",
          "This is s tiny museum and as it's stuck a specialist collection it's best to take the short tour to get the best reward. The guide demonstrates the various motors and encourages you to take part in the experiments to see how they work; so \u2026",
          "Disappointing - small, crowded, with the main event being the 15 min film about Tesla. There are experiments and although interesting, there's only 3 of them. They do have Tesla's ashes in the museum. The tickets are not expensive, but try to go during less popular hours. Also, the museum doesn't have a toilet for guests.",
          "It is a very small museum. If you want to have an English guided tour, you need to pay 500 dinars per person. They start with an introduction video about Tesla which takes nearly 15 minutes. The volume is too high for the small room. Then, \u2026",
          "\u0130ts really good place for visiting. You can see every electrical part of science.. if you are in belgrad u should go there.",
          "Make sure you catch the guided tour at the top of each hour - you\u2019ll watch a video about Nikola Tesla and then see a few neat demonstrations. I had to line up for about 45 minutes to get into the museum, and be aware that they only take \u2026",
          "We went to the Nikola Tesla museum primarily because our son is a fan of the great inventor and engineer. We all came out of the visit a little disappointed. The exhibition area is diminutive - three rooms - and our guide did not seem to be \u2026",
          "Great Museum, can nothing but recommend it. Make sure to check the tour hours, otherwise you won't be able to get the full experience. Very cheap too- tickets are 500din or about 5$/4.5\u20ac for entrance + tour!!!",
          "This is the only negative mark during my Serbian trip. The museum is very small, just two rooms, you are forced to follow a guided tour, I did not learn anything new about Tesla. It's a museum for kids, just a big spark from a Tesla coil \u2026",
          "500 cash entry. Visited in set times on the hour.  Max 70 people allowed. Gets busy.\nAmazing experience. 15 min film followed by presentation of experiments. Originaly inventions on display. Very cool",
          "don\u2019t pay for the \u2018tour\u2019 unless they fire the tour guide who is the rudest person we met in Belgrade. \nHe acted like he was doing as a favour to explain things, even though he was talking so fast we could not understand a word he was saying.",
          "If you visit make sure you go to one of their guided tours - it's not expensive and very informative plus they demonstrate how some of the exhibited motors work. My lower review is due to the facilities of the museum: 1. they will let you \u2026",
          "The museum is small, but the guide made it very interesting. Must see for school children, to learn and understand phisics",
          "Interactive museum with hourly tour and presentation!! I enjoyed it and learned a lot!",
          "We went there with high expectations but the presentation was very poor!! This, can be improved by reducing the visitors that follow the guide, so he has the chance to show more experiments!! We we're only shown one experiment in three different transformers!!",
          "It\u2019s a small museum about everything of Nicola Tesla. We paid 500 Dinar per person. That\u2019s with an included tour in English. All in all it isn\u2019t bad and worth visiting but because of the small size there\u2019s not so much to see compared to other museums.",
          "The museum itself is very interesting and also the explained machines but the fact that in busy hours were a lot of people in front and you miss to see them so you must wait to see them again when people leave. Also the structure isn't \u2026",
          "Small museum. 3 rooms. I\u2019d advice you to take the tour so you can take part in the experiment of the tesla coil and get more info. On your own you can see everything in 15 minutes.",
          "Gives an insight of Nikola Tesla and his life, but only the short version. The entrance is cheap and you get to see a short video of his life, and some of his inventions and clothes he had. I just feel like it was a bit rushed, and despite \u2026",
          "Loved it!!!! A great place where you can find interesting stories about Tesla, his discoveries and inventions which are used even today in a lot of products (hair dryer, refrigerator). You can also see how the inventions work, they are \u2026",
          "To see the museum, you must wait at the designated time for the tour in the language of your choice (I believe English and Serbian are the only two options). The tour guide, although knowledgeable, seemed very rushed and it was not \u2026",
          "Pretty small museum dedicated to Tesla himself and his inventions. At the beginning of tour you have to watch 15 minutes movie about Tesla's life. For me there were nothing new, but common facts. After the movie, you will see three Tesla coils in action and if you're lucky you can touch lightnings produced by baby coil.",
          "Small but very well organized. Great tour, very informative, both in English and Serbian.",
          "Sadly very disappointing. Had big hops and I am completely disappointed. The management is blowing a unique opportunity. Very sad for Belgrade. Just need professional management nothing els.",
          "Excellent experience! Watch a movie, get a small demonstration, and view the exhibit. Small enough that it's not tiring but extensive enough that it's interesting. Enjoyed it very much!",
          "Amazing museum to see and so much knowledge from Gide in museum !\nMust see!\nNo restrooms is problem NO WC!\nEven Tesla have to go.",
          "Amazing place to visit. Great place to experience original Tesla inventions including half milion coil.",
          "The museum all together was a very mediocre experience to be honest. We visited around the winter holidays and had to wait one and half an hour in line to get in. I would not mind the waiting but in fact they also raised the prices (from 4\u20ac \u2026",
          "Small museum where you can see and participate in the experiments that Nikola Tesla created.\nA great short science tutorial excellent for kids and good for adults as well.",
          "Smaller groups would be better as space is limited so the guide ( very pleasant and helpful young woman) had to repeat the experiments as it is impossible for more than 15 people to observe at the same time ( and there was 40 of us approx). Souvenur shop needs more items. Helpful and very polite staff.",
          "It is an interesting museum. You can feel and see what electricity is. You should join museum tour.",
          "Awesome experience. The works of a true genius who was ahead of his time.",
          "This is not a museum in a common sense.\nNo way to just come and see the exhibition, there is an obligatory tour that includes watching the videos and following around a guide with a terrible accent.\n\nIf you happen to show that you are not Serbian - your tickets will cost twice as much.",
          "Small museum with some interesting hands on exhibits. If you like being electrocuted this is the place to go. \ud83e\udd23",
          "Great though small museum about the inventions and life of Nikola Tesla. There are frequent guided explanations and demonstrations of the inventions in sequential order then after the demo visitors are free to explore the museum. The demo \u2026",
          "The guided tour was great, we even got to participate in an experiment! The guide was ltd and clear even though there was a lot of people that day. I loved the way he told the story of Tesla and his inventions. We also signed a guestbook. I hope I can find our signature and message if I visit again! :)",
          "Museum offers tours in both English and Serbian and experience is really memorable, especially if you already respect Nikola Tesla. If you are going to visit one place in Belgrade, visit Nikola Tesla museum.",
          "Amazing place to visit and discover things about the greatest Nikola Tesla. The museum is interactive and the tour guide was good and explain all the things very well. I really recommend this place to visit and to cultivate a little bit \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f",
          "there\u2019s nothing to see really it\u2019s like a tourist trap. you can google everything and you can watch videos. It will be better because I couldn\u2019t see anything it was too crowded. I regret that I paid 500 dinars for this and they didn\u2019t accept my student card.",
          "Very small museum. But since there are not so many places to visit in Belgrade it's worth to visit. At the very beginning they demonstate a 15 minutes video about Nicola Tesla, then they will show you two induction motors in work. That' s all",
          "Short tour, but very interesting with live demo. I am recommending a visit.",
          "Tour turned what would have been a short visit to a great and interesting experience",
          "This a quick must see spot. A museum dedicated to one of most amazing scientific geniuses.",
          "Such a shame they don't accept credit cards or foreign currencies is for souvenirs. On the other hand, our tour guide was great.",
          "Very interesting museum. If you take the tour you can see some of Tesla's experiments in action. The English tour was well done, but the tour was packed and a bit hard to see. It was really cool to see some of Tesla's experiments and personal possessions...and you can see his urn. Definitely recommended.",
          "Nikola Tesla Museum is one of the greatest museums I have ever seen in my life. There are a lot of things to see and do and it is a must if you visit Serbia!!!",
          "Disappointing, it could be so much more. Building looks like its never been washed or painted, especially on the side... embarrassing... second star only because it's associated with a great name of Nikola Tesla",
          "Perfect museum. Basic but important exhibition. For kids particularly.",
          "Make sure you check the opening time and day before you get there.  Tourists are not allowed to walk on their own, you have to stick with a tour guide. English tour group start at 10:00am. and every hours (must check their website for the \u2026",
          "A very nice hold Museum and a very nice presentation by the stuff there. The nice thing is, its not expensive but very nice games are played with us like those huge high voltage Rings.",
          "It is absolutely not worth to visit. Making people wait outside in the cold for a 10min long video presentation that tells basic facts about the life of Tesla. You could watch a better one on youtube at home in the warm for free. Followed \u2026",
          "Nikola Tesla as one of the most significant scientist in the history and his museum  in Belgrade. Museum dedicated to this great man will give you an amazing cultural and scientific experience. It is one of the only museum in the world which preserves his original and personal inheritance.",
          "Best place in beograd. Have to come early. The place have limited space and only open per hour until the previous guest is out",
          "The museum was great! You must know that they allow 75 people each hour. So you must be atvthe door at around 14:45 to have a good chance to enter the 15:00 tour.",
          "Get to know the life and scientific work of one of the biggest scientists of our era. Nikola Tesla the scientist whose surname Elon Musk chose as brand name for his electric car company because he is using Tesla's induction motor in his cars, like model S, which goes from 0 - 100km/h in 1.8s. Try beating that",
          "Small museum, albeit very interesting. Science lovers will be rewarded. One can see experiments and get a glimpse of Nikola Tesla\u2019s life and work. If you are in Belgrade don\u2019t miss it, but prepare to wait and queue",
          "One of better attractions in Belgrade, and place that is definitely worth visiting.",
          "Experimental part was interesting and quite well explained. Movie about Tesla was nice too but a bit hard too see (room was crowded and we\u2019ve got spots at the back). The line to get tickets is a bit of a mess. Depending on the day, time, season, you might need to wait quite a bit to get inside.",
          "Overall, a worthy place to visit because they exhibit stuff that Tesla actually wore, created, or wrote, which is amazing. At the same stuff, if you go as a group, the experience is dull because they basically present some basic childish \u2026",
          "The museum was good. Interesting video introduction (if you like science), and some cool electricity demonstrations. And best of all, it has great air conditioning! Would have given 5 stars, but we had to wait outside in the hot sun for 30 minutes before the tour started.",
          "Fun museum, smaller than I expected. Had some fun interactive pieces.",
          "Very interesting, there are tours at certain times, they often let A LOT of people in so be prepared for crowds. Fun to see the experiments and also worth noting his ashes are on premises.",
          "Interactive museum. There is a 15 minutes introductory movie about Tesla, then a staff member will showcase 3-4 of his inventions, 2 of which are interactive. There are other displays as well, including an interactive TV with various quotes \u2026",
          "An awesome museum dedicated to Nikola Tesla's life and work. I would have gave a 5 star but I couldn't because you cannot pay with Euros or credit card.",
          "For touristic purpose best place to visit in Belgrad...Museum staff is helpfull and polite..Had a electrical show during visit..Highly recommend to visit.\ud83d\udc4d",
          "This a very nice museum. It's on the small side as only the first floor is the museum. It seems to have gotten popular because they now only allow guided tours. It starts with a 10-15 min intro on Nikola Telsa then demonstrations on some of \u2026",
          "Nice, cozy, with interesting Tesla's experiments but much smaller and with less experiments than in Zagreb's technical museum.",
          "Would have been a great experience if it was more organised. We had about 50-60 people in one group. Everyone pushed and shoved it was a pretty snotty experience, especially considering we waited an hour and a half to get inside. \n\nIf they \u2026",
          "Entrance cost is 500, you must pay cash and in local currency.\nI enjoyed the museum but not a blind must do, go if you're interested in Tesla and or Engineering. Guided tours on the hour, our guide was good. Expect to spend 1hr. Tesla is a genius.",
          "A fair price for entrance,  however you MUST pay in Serbian money. No credit card. So much more to Tesla which is not presented. If you watch to movie in the museum it shows almost every item in the museum.",
          "Very polite and passionate people. Tesla deserve a bigger and modern museum though",
          "If you like Tesla's heritage, you'll like this museum",
          "Small, not many items, only on certain hours there is an English tour. We could not get to the upper floor - I guess it would open once a film was presented. Not recommending it.",
          "Small, but exceptional museum about Nicola Tesla and his work. Located in a historical building and displaying the typical museum stuff like Tesla's belonging, photos, some electrical measurement devices, papers, books, this museum is great \u2026",
          "If you visit Beograd you must see also this museum, it\u2019s will explain you how is working all the energy and practice with you!",
          "We had to stood in line for 50 mins. In the end we couldn't enter because there was still 20 more people ahead of us and we almost froze while waiting. They're letting in maybe 10 or 15 people every half hour.",
          "Come on, what to say about this place except one word: PERFECT.",
          "Absolutely fascinating! A building that celebrates the great success of Serbia\u2019s very own Nikola Tesla! Enjoy many interactive displays,demonstrations and live exhibitions! The staff are passionate about what they do and put on a good show. \u2026",
          "TESLA WAS ONE OF THE GREAT SCIENCENTIST AND THIS PLACE TELL US THING ABOUT SIR NICOLA TESLA",
          "if you come to Belgrade you must visit this genius' museum.\nextremely informative and amazing",
          "It was pretty little place. Inventions of Nikola Tesla occurs in the museum. After a video that tells a short story about his life, a guide talks about his inventions to the visitors. Guide is also doing the trial of some machines. If you \u2026",
          "It's very interesting, I don't give 5 stars because too many people in the same group.",
          "Check out tour times carefully before you visit.  Only around 60 people allowed in per hour and there were twice that when we got there.  Tours are either in Serbian or English but not alternating. Research your visit or you will be waiting outside for a long time!",
          "Walked in and went to the ticket counter. when i asked a fair question about the tour, i was met with an unnecessarily surly, unpleasant, and rude attitude. as if she was just mad... and dumping it onto me. \n\ni walked out. it\u2019s not about the money... it\u2019s about the respect. how can you treat your patrons this way? astonishing.",
          "For any fans of Tesla, this is a great place to go, since this is where it all began. They have a brief 15-minute video which is a great introduction.",
          "Small. You need to wait for an English tour to start, you cannot go and visit on your own the museum. Without the tour, you only have access to bottom floor with very few uninteresting exponates.",
          "Very nice and interesting place, anyone who wants to learn more about Nikola Tesla and his inventions should really come here. The staff is really nice and helpful",
          "This place is a must visit for science lovers. It is located in a building which belonged to a political figure. It  showcases many of Tesla's inventions.\nThe tour begins with a 15 minute video about Tesla. Then some of the Tesla motors are \u2026",
          "If you love Tesla's work. This is a must in Belgrade!",
          "Inventions of Tesla are explained well with the prototype developed by himself. Wireless transmission of power (artificial lightening) and electric motor are breathtaking.",
          "A tourist trap. Only 3 small rooms really. Nothing much learnt here that you don\u2019t already know from Wikipedia, the main attraction being a some working models of induction motors and such gizmos. The kind of demonstrations you get in an \u2026",
          "Interesting and cheap, but unfortunately the groups size is too big: 65 persons in such a small space, we couldn't see the movie or the experiments.",
          "This museum could and should be electric but its not. Worth a visit if just as a homage to a fascinating character. If you do go stay around for the free guided tour with film or the museum is likely to be a disappointment, the tour raises the experience to something more memorable.",
          "Small but amazing.. Specially for those interested in science. A very lovely must visit place in Belgrade.",
          "Lack of content. Organization of the groups lacking efficiency: one has to wait 1 hour for a guided tour and on the weekends with the maxiumum capacity of 75 people you do not get to see the actual demonstrations properly. If an experiment \u2026",
          "We went here to day morning , and stayed in line to enter but we're not allowed as the Mayor of Belgrade was inside , this was the first time I have experience this in any country but we still stayed in patience as Nicola Tesla is a \u2026",
          "Very small museum but it is understandable since the entrance fee is very low (500 Huf). Was nice watching those experiments with such an exciting tour guider! She was explaining the things with such excitement that made me like the topic more",
          "nice historical musim about nicola tesla the exhibits are nice",
          "Very small museum where you can only enter on a guided tour. When we went tours were every hour some in English some Serbian, it is not possible to book tickets so you are forced to arrive early and wait in the hope that you can get in. Our \u2026",
          "It's tiny. You must check out the times for the guided tours before you go because you can see the museum only with them. They show you a 20mins video at the begining and continue with conducting 2 experiments with Tesla's inventions. The rest is not much but if you are in the area, do stop-by.",
          "Great museum with a lot  of Tesla personal items, the one I found most interesting was the hat with his initials engraved on the inside.\n Great tours in English and Serbian.  Wasn't expensive.  You are allowed to take pictures, but not to take videos of presentations.",
          "The museum itself is very interesting and provides nice experiments related to Tesla's inventions. Unfortunately the museum is very small and lacked a bit if organization in the guided tours.",
          "In this museum, specialist guides present the unique stories about Nikola Tesla, while showing the authentic working models of Tesla\u2019s machines. Tesla's personal items and artefacts, including his urn, are at display as well. The exclusive \u2026",
          "We should name it Nicola Tesla model testing centre instead of museum. Some small interesting things for kids that's it. Nothing more than that. You can finish entire museum in 30 mins.",
          "Absolutely loved it. I wish my son was with me. Don't forget to buy souvenirs",
          "lovely, but small",
          "The story of Nikola Tesla in one place. Our tour guide was very good and we realy enjoyed",
          "Excellent experience and english tour! Highly recommending to visit!",
          "Nikola Tesla was a dreamer and a genious that among others wanted to distribute electrical power to the poor. The least that someone can do, to honour this amazing scientist is visit his museum.",
          "Loved it!!! The guide was very dynamic and made the experience one of the most fun and engaging parts of my stay in Belgrade. Absolutely recommend.",
          "It was amazing! 100% recommend you to come and visit.",
          "Interactive museum my friends thoroughly enjoyed",
          "Small museum but definitely worth the short time. \nMainly a video presentation and a practical experience demonstration plus some free time to look around and check out some displays.",
          "It \u2019s very popular and there are lots of people.  But the order is not kept.  Many interrupts.  A small museum.  Experiments using Tesla coils can be seen.  Excited with a loud sound.",
          "Great interactive experiences with high voltage coils",
          "small but interesting. could be nice to have a tour guide in greek",
          "Really cool museum with several interactive displays. You must visit this museum if you are an admirer of Nikola Tesla.",
          "To see all those marvelous inventions was wonderful. Tour guide was very helpful and patient. But it was very crowded and people had hard time to see experiments.",
          "Museum which should be on your list of places to visit in Belgrade. Tour is not long, very brief, nicely explained and guided for everyone's understanding. Nikola Tesla was an exceptional human being and this place emits that vibe from the moment you step in.",
          "Okay museum although I think it is best if you have a good understanding of electricity and magnetism which I forgot already. The demo assumed that you already did so I was really confused about how stuff worked. It was cool though but if \u2026",
          "Interesting and and fun with live demos. \n\nWarning: will almost definitely have to queue. Doing so in the summer sun is not fun. \n\nHaving gotten in it\u2019s small and intimate. Unlike other museums you start with a video about Tesla\u2019s life and \u2026",
          "Small museum with basic information on Nikola Tesla and several his most important  discoveries presented as small scale artifacts.",
          "We went there and we had to wait one hour in order to get inside. This information should have been mentioned in the website.  On top of that we could not pay with credit card or cash euro. The tour lasted aprox. 45 minutes and the 15 was a video. Also there were not so many items on display.",
          "Really interesting,  well laid out , great experiments with the Tesla coil(how forward thinking was this man!)and the video-presentation was really informative and easy to understand.Learnt a lot!",
          "Very good show ! Small, but beautyful !",
          "A great way to understand the breadth of Tesla\u2019s visions and inventive mind. The coil is incredible to see in person.",
          "Very nice staff and very helpful when you ask them something. If you are visiting Belgrade and want to learn something new be sure to visit this museum.",
          "During the guided tour, there were too many people. The exhibition itself is small, but very nice done! Very good explanation!",
          "Amazing place, go there! Lots of details and fragments of Nikola Tesla's life. Good, working exhibits of Tesla Coils",
          "Very interesting! I really liked it.",
          "Nice but little than I expected. It is also fun to participate in experiments :)",
          "There are very small space inside. They started with a 15' min movie about Tesla. Than shows 3 demonstrations. After you have one more room to visit. They do not have toilets. Do not accept Euro and credit cards. As well, the visit in \u2026",
          "The visits are well organized but you need to wait for a tour to start. The staff are friendly and very knowledgeable.",
          "It's a great place to visit and see some interesting invention of the Great Nikola Tesla, with an exciting demo and live experiments on some machines. Would love to see more of his legacy though to quinch my thirst.",
          "This museum not enough for magnificent man Nikola Tesla, it has to be better. \u0130nfo: Museum is close on monday.",
          "There is three room. Small place but interesting. Especially teslas bobbin...",
          "Different type of miseum. Interactive experiments arw really excellent, so you can actually see what was Tesla's work all about.",
          "A small museum with Tesla's personal belongings and inventions. The price for the tour is 500rsd including short movie of Tesla achievements and few demonstrations of Tesla work. In conclusion it worths the price.",
          "A bit small, but very informative. It's a quick tour and they have a few working Tesla coils to play with",
          "Very cool museum. Interactive. If you are looking to do it in English make sure to double check the times for guided English tours. They have a very informative 15 minute video at the start. Then the guide will show you all the cool Tesla \u2026",
          "The building itself is nice however inside it\u2019s quite small for 60 persons. It was too crowd but it could be interesting for less visitors at the same time for sure. We\u2019ve waited 50 mins to get inside and there were no toilets for visitors :(... so we\u2019ve got the advice to go outside. It does not worth to wait and pay for it.",
          "Here you can find different inventions of Tesla, and it's really amazing",
          "Some impressive Teslas inventions to see, all the congrats to the tour guide, Tesla deserves  much bigger museum :)",
          "Good place to visit, maybe one place which you must visit in Beograd.",
          "The museum part is much smaller than we anticipated. A 15 minute movie is shown then a couple of demonstrations of Tesla's ingenuity are performed. After you walk through a few small rooms with his artifacts and his machines and end at his \u2026",
          "Small but quite interesting museum, must see for residents and tourists.",
          "the viewing is done through groups. if the group is more than 20 you will probably see nothing if you are not in the front. A limit to the size of the group will solve this.\n\nNot so much written expalanation on the items. If you miss hearing the tour guide ... you probbaly will have to look it up in google.",
          "One of the best museums i have ever been in its telling lot of about Telsa and his importnance in science and its really awsome to be by his urna.",
          "Being a huge Nikola Tesla fanboy this was a must and it definitely didn't disappoint.\nI really can't recommend this little museum enough!!",
          "Fantastic! One of the must- see amusements in Belgrade. Take care that regarding space inside staff allow only to group up to 65 peoples come in on every complete hour. In meantime it is not possible to buy tickets. VR tours are during \u2026",
          "I would not recommend it, it s cheap but it is not worth the lost time. Just one floor and the main attraction is the coil.",
          "The museum is beautifully presented and has great potential. The tour was interesting but the group was so large that I couldn\u2019t see any of the demonstrations. I went on the 19:00 Saturday tour so maybe try for a weekday and an earlier \u2026",
          "Smaller place than I thought, but also just 500 Din. Tours start at the hour. Nice AC demonstration. The video they show during the tour could be a bit less enthusiastic.",
          "Limited to only 65 people per hour only, not advertised!!! . Get there quick, but for all of 5 euros no complaints. Staff are fantastic as is the museum experience",
          "The special magic of Nikola Tesla is there. Tesla's machines and experiences will be described by the nice museum guides. But be prepared to wait a little in the queue before entering the house. Visiting this museum is a must for everybody interested in Tesla's life.",
          "Great museum,  worths to visit if you have  kids.",
          "Small museum dedicated to the most brillant scientist of his time. Short movie about his life and work, guided tour through some of his contributions to the world and his belongings. Amazing demonstration of his inventions.",
          "Museum costs 500 dinar and includes a 15 minute movie and guided tour. The movie was overcrowded so about half of the people had to stand and watch from far away. The museum is very small, but could be interesting if you've never seen a \u2026",
          "Nice, compact - which is both good and bad. There could be more stuff, but the stuff you do see is well arranged and informative. Love the Tesla coils :-D",
          "It was cool to see and participate experiments, but other than that, there were nothing much to learn about Tesla, very small museum, only the first floor is used. First 10 minutes of the tour was a short video about Tesla, but acoustic was not good, either speaker was not good, or I was just sitting too far from it...",
          "If you r in Belgrade, dont miis it.",
          "Quite poor expedition to honour such a great inventor as Nikola Tesla",
          "Cash only. \n\nCannot enter the museum ourselves but have to follow a guide. Guides in English are available for almost every two hours, so it'd be better to schedule your visit in advance.\n\nThe introduction of the history of Nicolas Tesla and demonstration of his electrical machines are fascinating.\n\nThe museum has only one floor.",
          "Visiting only with guide possible (groups of 50people are allowed per tour, tour every 30min, 500RDS), to wait for it would ok however with such big group not possible to see much from what is being presented by a guide, individual \u2026",
          "Must visit and get know better about the scientist that brought the nowday electricity to us. Beside that he was a visionar who predicted all the technology we are using now a long time ago during his lifetime. In this museum you will get the opportunity to check how his invents are functioning.",
          "Small but interesting and educational. There's a guided tour in English at 12:00.",
          "really interesting museum",
          "Excellent place. Well worth the visit. Exciting for all ages.",
          "Very cheap, good fun with lots of demonstrations of the devices Nikola Tesla had designed himself such as the transformers etc",
          "The only place where youll see Tesla ashes. Very small museum for a big man.",
          "Nice tour, pretty cheap. The Tesla coils are amazing. Liked the experiments they did",
          "There is nothing special about it. Some prototypes, a 15 min documentary very unspecific, a 5 min demonstration and 2 rooms full of pieces of machineries and old clothes. At least, with our student reduction, it was quite cheap (English tour for students 2,5 euros, full ticket 4,90 per person).",
          "Waited for 30 min outside because of the crowd. Than finnaly tour started and the room was full of visitors and we couldnt see anything.. there are just 3 small rooms in whole museum.. the exepriments cant be done by yourself.. tesla \u2026",
          "Just Wow! \nThis Interactive Experience is a must-try if you ever been in belgrade.",
          "Beautiful museum. \ud83d\ude03",
          "Amazing, interactive museum with spectacular experiments you can get involved with. A nice tribute to one of the most important scientists of all time. It is however unfortunate that they only accept the ISIC student card and not any other types.",
          "Very busy, cramped. Have to have a tour which misses key exhibits and incorrectly describes others. It starts with a 15 minute video, then gives you another 15 minutes looking at a Tesla coil and remote control boat. Then you've got ten - \u2026",
          "Interesting a small journey in a brilliant man's mind",
          "Interesting.  An educational talk; collection includes his personal effects.",
          "Nikola Tesla Museum isn't another museum named to honor a great. It is literally Nikola Tesla's posthumous home. Very well curated too.  A must visit!",
          "Very nice place, very nice staff, closed on Mondays, so be careful. (If your visit has to be on Monday, beforehand make a reservation for a VR tour, then you can see the museum this way ;))",
          "Much smaller than I have expected. Almost disappointment. They are trying to convince people about some conspiracy with Nikola Tesla's inventions and death. Be careful and arrive quater to any opening hour. Each hour starts the new group. You are not allowed to turn machines on. Boring.",
          "Only guided tours are available. Short video introduction plus some interctive presentations.",
          "Fantastic. Live demo with prototypes",
          "This is the museum of the man who gave you the power to use your phone and everything else",
          "The best scientist.",
          "1-2 very good experiments,nice artifacts and cool rumors from a great invertor",
          "Such a cool place! The movie about Tesla\u2019s life is so interesting and the demonstration of his electrical machines is pretty amazing. Highly recommended.",
          "Tiny museum. The tour starts with a 15 min movie, audio played from little home speakers and the sound was bad. The guide is nice, the tour itself discuss tesla coil in a very simple way. The museum has a few inventions and some personal belongings. No reason to go there.",
          "Nikola Tesla museum is a fantastic place for everyone. Everybody can see the film about Tesla 's constractio'ns,and understand why he is the father  of wi-fi...",
          "Great experience! You should try to be a voluntier all the Tesla's experiments!",
          "Nice, but a small museum, where you see a pair of experiments he made and a video of his life.",
          "Its ok, a lot of great stuff from Nikola, But at the end, when they show experiments, you cant see nothing, because its to many people inside",
          "Small but nice museum. The way it works since it's small is base on guided tours, only in Serbian and English are offered. You can't buy the tickets in advance and you have to pay with the national currency. The cost is 500 dinars. After you can buy very interesting books there. About Nikola Tesla obviously.",
          "The experiment during the tour was so cool!",
          "Small, but adorable, impressive and inspiring museum which captures the essence of Tesla's greatness and ingenuity.\nThe English guided ture was nice but a bit too shallow.\nThe display of Tesla's ashes in a metal ball is astounding and honorable. \nTotally worth the time.",
          "Great place of a great man. Guided tour is very funny because it contains live experiments. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "Short,not enough good explanations,to much people in group. I think group of max 15,20people will be better.",
          "Great place to be for science enthusiasts and to get to know the legend of Nikola Tesla",
          "Great staff, excellent place to learn more about Tesla's work and life!",
          "Not have to visit its boring",
          "A must see when in Belgrade! Nikola Tesla museum is a perfect place to get more familiar with both professional and personal life of one of the biggest scientists and inventors of our World! Be sure to follow the guided tours (there are \u2026",
          "It could have been much better if there was guiding in english whole day through and could pay by card",
          "Cultural scientific experience not to be missed",
          "A must see in Belgrade. One of the most important inventors in the world has the museum in Belgrade with an extraordinary exhibition as well as an mind blowing tours. My warm recommendation for everyone to visit this place.",
          "The museum is fine, but not well aganced... you wait hours to go in (under the rain) and you find a little place to see the presentation video. But still very interesting story and man. Then they show you how the old machines works. That's really cool!",
          "From the outside it looks like a small house and you begin to wonder whether this is a tourist trap. But once you enter and pay the minimal fee, its a place of some serious facts, knowledge and great history. The ticket is also your tour \u2026",
          "Very important museum in Belgrade. Dedicated to the men who gave electrical power, wireless, internal combustion motor and much more to the world - Nikola Tesla!\nThe museum is small, and you can see some of original clothes and items that \u2026",
          "Really good museum, representing and teaching people what Serbian genius did to this world.",
          "If you're going, definitely only go for the tour. The museum is fairly underwhelming, considering this is the country where Tesla is from and he is so highly regarded here.\nThe tour is just a 15 minute video and a couple of tesla coil \u2026",
          "Groups of 70 people. Maximum capacity shiuld be 20. Not enough seating place. Badly organised reservation and entrance. No toilet facilities for waiting guest. English Guide Mariya was very informative.",
          "Worth checking out if you're nearby. The tour was fascinating and fun but only about 15 minutes long after the video. Besides the tour there's very little of interest in the small building. There is NO bathroom. I asked where the nearest \u2026",
          "Hands on tour with demonstrations. Good price. The entry process is more complicated than it should be. You can\u2019t go inside and have to wait outside in the heat but it\u2019s because the museum is small and there\u2019s not a lot of room in there.",
          "Very busy little museum. Make sure you check when there is a tour in your language. We were lucky to happen upon an English tour which was informative and fun with demonstrations of machinery. Worth the walk",
          "Nice place, we just expecting that it will be bigge.",
          "Everything perfect apart from the sound of the video was shocking. Need to move the speaker to the front so it's more audible! Everyone I talked to complained about this. Top priority to fix!!!!",
          "Very nice place. Good for kids too. A timetable whit online information about entries whit English would helpful.",
          "Fantastic museum albeit very small. Live demonstrations are very impressive!\nCheck beforehand the slots available for visits in your language!",
          "It seems to me that this only scratches at the surface. On the other hand, there is much here that is not found \u00e9lsewhere. Real history!",
          "This museum was pretty fun! You will only be admitted on a tour, which involves a 15 minute video about Tesla, then demonstrations of various bits of equipment, which is really entertaining. Expensive by the standards of Serbian museums (500 pp).",
          "In my opinion it is the Best place I visited in Belgrade. It is so inspiring to hear the story of one of the greatest scientists. I was amazed by the experiment with the lightning. There are a lot of his personal items there and some of his \u2026",
          "Nice place with a lot of info.",
          "Exhibitions are nice. However, 60 people in one tour is too much - you cannot see anything because of the crowd - so disappointing. On top of it, student ISIC discount sign was after the selling counter.",
          "A well done documentary with experiments only wish it had a washroom.",
          "Very cool tour. English tours are at certain times. No restroom here.",
          "This small museum is well worth visiting. It will only take an hour to explore and be entertained and informed by the museum staff as they introduce Tesla and some of his amazing inventions. This is the most authentic Tesla museum in the \u2026",
          "Learn from the greatest. Tesla's museum gives you lots of answers - and lots of new questions are asked too...",
          "Great place. Every hour there is a show. Arrive in the place at least half an hour earlier for every show",
          "Nice place! Better to make a phonecall before you arrived! Many groups are going there! Just ask if there place for you!",
          "It is OK but the tour feels a bit rushed. Watch this video, here is a device check how cool it is, there some stuff over there did you see how cool they are? OK you can go now.",
          "A nice little place to get to know his more intimate details. The man is amazing not only because of his inventions but his thoughtfulness and persistence to improve people s wellbeing.",
          "I was expecting much more. It was only two rooms that had the inventions of Tesla.",
          "Really good museum, very interesting and has historical events linked to it , so I really liked it here , and I recommend to anyone who comes to Belgrad to also visit this museum. You will also enjoy an amazing movie about Nikola Tesla's \u2026",
          "So much information and fun",
          "Small museum, a bit to crowded. It does not pay homage enough to the person that invented electrity. Interesting but a bit desapointing",
          "We were kicked out from the group because our litle kid was too noisy (not even crying). It is not posible to visit without a tour so not suitble for noisy families. They didnt give money back, so lost of money and time.",
          "A must see museum while in Belgrade and an obligation to pay your respects to the greatest inventor of all time.",

          "Amazing tiny museum. The guide is very knowledge on the subject. Tour guides in English are are specific times. And depends on the quantity of visitors. Not much to see but I think it is still growing. One of the most important persons on human history",
          "Interactive but really small.",
          "Much information. Science and history to touch.",
          "Only 3 small rooms here, but the guided toor is nice. You can see some of Tesla's inventions in action.",
          "Great museum to bring homage to one of the worlds greatest inventors, Nikola Tesla !",
          "The museum is always visited with the help of a guide. Get there early because it reaches capacity fast. Tours start on the hour, and the timetable for languages (Serbski or English) is on the door. Well worth the wait - see practical \u2026",
          "It's a bit expressive compared to the other museums, but it's interesting to visit",
          "Great place to learn about Nikola Tesla. Extremely friendly staff.",
          "Interesting place. Only takes 65 people per group per hour, so either book or come early.",
          "It was a great visit and I am glad that we stopped there",
          "You must take a guided tour, so you can see the experiments!\nWe came from Slovenia and took a tour in Serbo-Croatian. The guide was speaking so fast we could barely understand him. But besides that, it was great!\nA parking space is available in the street.",
          "They have an appallingly bad system for entry; you cannot buy a ticket for a specific time slot, and you have to wait in line outside, while more and more people show up. This, by itself, wouldn't be so bad, if there was a proper waiting \u2026",
          "Nikola Tesla has always been one of my hero's! The tiny museum is well worth the money, around 5 dollars I believe. You learn so much and you actually get to seem some of his working creations. Whats interesting is Nikola Tesla actually \u2026",
          "Worst museum I've been: expensive for what really is (only four small rooms), the people working there are not kind, you are obliged to pay a tour in certain hours, the interactive screens doesn't work properly, and there is no bathroom.\nGoing here is throwing your money away, without doubt.",
          "Great museum dedicated to a true genius.  Guide gave demonstrations of his remote controlled boat and Tesla coil.  Very entertaining and informative.",
          "Must visit place. So much history here :)",

          "Horrible experience. Waited in line in the scorching 35 degrees heat because we were told the first 65 people would get in. We were within the first 40 people but not let in last minute anyway. No communication and quite rude treatment. We were very disappointed.",
          "There is not much thing to see inside. His personal clothes & ashes... Only a demonstration of an induction machine could be interesting. Other than that none of exhibits really is relavant with his science & inventions."

It is Georgia's dominant religious institution, and a majority of Georgian people are members. The Orthodox Church of Georgia is one of the oldest churches in the world. It asserts apostolic foundation, and its historical roots must be traced to the early and late Christianization of Iberia and Colchis by Saint Andrew in the 1st century AD and by Saint Nino in the 4th century AD, respectively.\nAs in similar autocephalous Orthodox churches, the Church's highest governing body is the Holy Synod of bishops. The church is headed by the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia, currently Ilia II, who was elected in 1977.\nOrthodox Christianity was the state religion throughout most of Georgia's history until 1921, when it was conquered by the Russian Red Army during the Russian-Georgian War and became part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.).  The current Constitution of Georgia recognizes the special role of the Georgian Orthodox Church in the country's history, but also stipulates the independence of the church from the state. Government relations are further defined and regulated by the Concordat of 2002.\nThe church is the most trusted institution in Georgia. According to a 2013 survey 95% respondents had a favorable opinion of its work. It is highly influential in the public sphere and is considered Georgia's most influential institution.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\n\n==== Traditions regarding Christianity's first appearance in Iberia and Colchis ====\nAccording to Georgian Orthodox Church tradition, the first preacher of the Gospel in Colchis and Iberia (modern-day Western and Eastern Georgia) was the apostle Andrew, the First-called. According to the official church account, Andrew preached across Georgia, carrying with him an acheiropoieta of the Virgin Mary (an icon believed to be created \"not by human hand\"), and founded Christian communities believed to be the direct ancestors of the Church. However, modern historiography considers this account mythical, and the fruit of a late tradition, derived from 9th-century Byzantine legends about the travels of St. Andrew in eastern Christendom. Similar traditions regarding Saint Andrew exist in Ukraine, Cyprus and Romania. Other apostles claimed by the Church to have preached in Georgia include Simon the Canaanite (better known in the West as Simon the Zealot) said to have been buried near Sokhumi, in the village of Anakopia, and Saint Matthias, said to have preached in the southwest of Georgia, and to have been buried in Gonio, a village not far from Batumi. The Church also claims the presence in Georgia of the Apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus, coming north from Armenia.\n\n\n==== The Conversion of Iberia ====\n\nThe propagation of Christianity in present-day Georgia before the 4th century is still poorly known. The first documented event in this process is the preaching of Saint Nino and its consequences, although exact dates are still debated. Saint Nino, honored as Equal to the Apostles, was according to tradition the daughter of a Roman general from Cappadocia. She preached in the Caucasian Kingdom of Iberia (also known as Kartli) in the first half of the 4th century, and her intercession eventually led to the conversion of King Mirian III, his wife Queen (later Saint) Nana and their family. Cyril Toumanoff dates the conversion of Mirian to 334, his official baptism and subsequent adoption of Christianity as the official religion of Iberia to 337. From the first centuries C.E., the cult of Mithras, pagan beliefs,  and Zoroastrianism were commonly practiced in Georgia. However, they now started to gradually decline, even despite Zoroastrianism becoming a second established religion of Iberia after the Peace of Acilisene in 378, and more precisely by the mid-fifth century.The royal baptism and organization of the Church were accomplished by priests sent from Constantinople by Constantine the Great. Conversion of the people of Iberia proceeded quickly in the plains, but pagan beliefs long subsisted in mountain regions. The western Kingdom of Lazica was politically and culturally distinct from Iberia at that time, and culturally more integrated into the Roman Empire; some of its cities already had bishops by the time of the First Council of Nicea (325).\n\n\n=== Expansion and Transformation of the Church ===\nThe conversion of Iberia marked only the beginnings of the formation of the Georgian Orthodox Church. In the next centuries, different processes took place that shaped the Church, and gave it, by the beginning of the 11th century, the main characteristics that it has retained until now. Those processes concern the institutional status of the Church inside Eastern Christianity, its evolution into a national church with authority over all of Georgia, and the dogmatic evolution of the church..\n\n\n==== The long path to autocephaly ====\nIn the 4th and 5th centuries, the Church of Iberia was strictly subordinate to the Apostolic See of Antioch: all bishops were consecrated in Antioch before being sent to Iberia. Around 480, in a step towards autocephaly, the Patriarch of Antioch Peter the Fuller elevated the Bishop of Mtskheta to the rank of Catholicos of Iberia with the approval, or at the instigation, of the Byzantine emperor Zeno. The Church remained subordinate to the Antioch Church; the Catholicos could appoint local bishops, but until the 740s, his own election had to be confirmed by the synod of the Church of Antioch, and even after the 8th century, annual payments were made to the Church of Antioch.In 1010, the Catholicos of Iberia was elevated to the honor of Patriarch. From then on, the premier hierarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church carried the official title of Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia.\n\n\n==== Territorial expansion and birth of a national church ====\n\nAt the beginnings of the Church history, what is now Georgia was not unified yet politically, and would not be until the beginnings of the 11th century. The western half of the country, mostly constituted of the kingdom of Lazica, or Egrisi, was under much stronger influence of the Byzantine Empire than eastern Iberia, where Byzantine, Armenian and Persian influences coexisted. Such division was reflected in major differences in the development of Christianity.\nIn the east, from the conversion of Mirian, the church developed under the protection of the kings of Iberia, or Kartli. A major factor in the development of the church in Iberia was the introduction of the Georgian alphabet. The impulse for a script adapted to the language of the local people stemmed from efforts to evangelize the population. A similar dynamic led to the creation of the Armenian alphabet. The exact origin of the script is still debated, but must have happened in the second half of the 4th century or the early 5th century. The introduction of monasticism, and its tremendous development, in Iberia in the 6th century encouraged both foreign cultural inputs and the development of local written works.  From that moment, together with translations of the Bible, ecclesiastical literature in Georgian was produced in Iberia, most prominently biographies of saints, such as the \"Martyrdom of the Holy Queen Shushanik\" and the \"Martyrdom of Saint Abo\". Many of the saints from the first centuries of the church were not ethnic Georgians (Shushanik was an Armenian princess, Abo an Arab), showing that the church had not yet acquired a strictly national character.This changed only during the 7th century, after the wide political and cultural changes brought about by the Muslim conquests. This new menace for local culture, religion, and autonomy, and the difficulties to maintain constant contact with other Christian communities, led to a drastic cultural change inside the Church, which became for the first time ethnically focused: it evolved into a \"Kartvelian Church\". The bishops and Catholicos were now all ethnic Georgians, as were the saints whose \"Lives\" were written from that period.In the western half of Georgia, ancient Colchis, which had remained under stronger Roman influence, local churches were under jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and were culturally and linguistically Hellenistic. Bishops from the port cities took part in ecumenical councils, from the Council of Nicea (325) together with those from the Byzantine territories. From the 6th century, those churches, whose language remained Greek, were headed by a metropolitan in Phasis. The integration of the Black sea coastal regions into what came to be known as Georgia was a long process. A first step came with the Arab invasions of the 7th and 8th centuries, which mostly affected Iberia. Refugees, among them noblemen such as Archil of Kakheti, took shelter in the West, either in Abkhazia or Tao-Klarjeti, and brought there their culture. Such movements led to the progressive merge of western and eastern churches under the latter, as Byzantine power decreased and doctrinal differences disappeared. The western Church broke away from Constantinople and recognized the authority of the Catholicos of Mtskheta by the end of the 9th century. Political unification under the Bagrationi dynasty consolidated this evolution by the end of the 10th century: in a single, unified Kingdom of Georgia, there would be a unified Georgian Church.\n\n\n==== Relations with the Armenian and Byzantine churches ====\nDuring the first centuries of Christianity, the South Caucasus was culturally much more united than in later periods, and constant interactions between what would become the Georgian and Armenian Churches shaped both of them. The Armenian Church was founded two decades earlier, and was during the 4th century larger and more influential than the Church in Iberia. As such, it exerted strong influence in the early doctrine of the Church. The influence of the Church of Jerusalem was also strong, especially in liturgy. The Georgian-Armenian ecclesial relationship would be tested after the Council of Chalcedon (451), whose christological conclusions were rejected by the Armenian Church and important portions of the Church of Antioch, as well as the Coptic Church based in Alexandria.\nAt first, the Catholicoi of Iberia chose the anti-Chalcedonian camp together with the Armenians, even though diversity of opinions was always present among the clergy, and tolerated by the hierarchy. The king of Iberia, Vakhtang Gorgasali, who sought an alliance with Byzantium against the Persians, accepted the Henotikon, a compromise put forward by the Byzantine Emperor Zeno in 482. Such conciliation was attempted again at the First Council of Dvin in 506, and the status quo was preserved during the 6th century.\nAround 600 however, tensions flared between the Armenian Apostolic Church and the church in Iberia, as the Armenian Church attempted to assert prominence in the Caucasus, in both hierarchical and doctrinal matters, whereas the Catholicos of Mtskheta, Kirion I, leaned towards the Byzantine, Chalcedonian side of the debate, as Iberia was once again seeking imperial support against the Sassanid Empire, who had abolished the Kingdom in 580. The Third Council of Dvin, in 607, sanctioned the rupture with the Armenian Church.The following centuries confirmed the Byzantine orientation of the Georgian Church, and its estrangement from the Armenian Church. Confessional disputes remained impossible to overcome, and were a staple of theological literature in both areas. The integration of western and eastern Georgian churches from the 9th century also sealed the Orthodox nature of the Georgian Church, as Byzantine liturgy and cultural forms spread to the detriment of traditional Oriental practice.\n\n\n=== The Church during the Golden Age of Georgia ===\nBetween the 11th and the early 13th centuries, Georgia experienced a political, economical and cultural golden age, as the Bagrationi dynasty managed to unite western and eastern halves of the country into a single kingdom. To accomplish that goal, kings relied much on the prestige of the Church, and enrolled its political support by giving it many economical advantages, immunity from taxes and large appanages. At the same time, the kings, most notably David the Builder (1089\u20131125), used state power to interfere in church affairs. In 1103, he summoned the council of Ruisi-Urbnisi, which condemned Armenian Miaphysitism in stronger terms than ever before, and gave unprecedented power, second only to the Patriarch, to his friend and advisor George of Chqondidi. For the following centuries, the Church would remain a crucial feudal institution, whose economical and political power would always be at least equal to that of the main noble families.\n\n\n=== Cultural influence of Christianity in Medieval Georgia ===\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Christianity was the central element of Georgian culture. The development of a written Georgian culture was made possible by the creation of the Georgian alphabet for evangelization purposes. Monasticism played a major role in the following cultural transformation. It started in Georgia in the 6th century, when Assyrian ascetic monks, known as the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers, settled in Iberia and founded a series of monasteries, most notably David Gareja. They were soon joined by local monks, which led to the creation of significant works of hagiographic literature in Georgian, such as the \"Life of Saint Nino\" and the \"Martyrdom of the Holy Queen Shushanik\". The golden age of Georgian monasticism lasted from the 9th to the 11th century. During that period, Georgian monasteries were founded outside the country, most notably on Mount Sinai, Mount Athos (the Iviron monastery, where the Theotokos Iverskaya icon is still located), and in Palestine. The most prominent figure in the history of Georgian monasticism is judged to be Gregory of Khandzta (759\u2013861), who founded numerous communities in Tao-Klarjeti.\n\nSpecific forms of art were developed in Georgia for religious purposes. Among them, calligraphy, polyphonic church singing, cloisonn\u00e9 enamel icons, such as the Khakhuli triptych, and the \"Georgian cross-dome style\" of architecture, which characterizes most medieval Georgian churches. The most celebrated examples of Georgian religious architecture of the time include the Gelati Monastery and Bagrati Cathedral in Kutaisi, the Ikalto Monastery complex and Academy, and the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta.\nOutstanding Georgian representatives of Christian culture include Peter the Iberian (Petre Iberieli, 5th century), Euthymius of Athos (Ekvtime Atoneli, 955\u20131028), George of Athos (Giorgi Atoneli, 1009\u20131065), Arsen Ikaltoeli (11th century), and Ephrem Mtsire, (11th century). Philosophy flourished between the 11th and 13th century, especially at the Academy of Gelati Monastery, where Ioane Petritsi attempted a synthesis of Christian, aristotelician and neoplatonic thought.\n\n\n=== The division of the Church (13th\u201318th centuries) ===\nThe Mongol invasions in the 13th century and Tamerlane in the 14\u201315th century greatly disrupted Georgian Christianity. The political unity of the country was broken several times, and definitely in the 1460s. Churches and monasteries were targeted by the invaders, as they hosted many treasures. As a result of those devastations, many fell into disrepair or were abandoned. In the western half of Georgia, the Catholicate of Abkhazia was established following the Mongol rule. It seceded from the Mtskheta see as the Kingdom disintegrated, and the western Catholicos thereafter assumed the title of Patriarch. This rival seat, based first in Pitsunda, then at the Gelati Monastery near Kutaisi, subsisted until 1795. During those times, contacts with the Catholic Church increased, first as a way to liberate itself from meddling by the Byzantine Church, then to find stronger allies against invaders. Between 1328 and the early 16th century, a Catholic bishop had his see in Tbilisi to foster those contacts. However, formal reunion with Rome never happened, and the Church remained faithful to Eastern Orthodoxy.In the next centuries, Georgia, weakened and fragmented, fell under the domination of the Ottoman and successive Persian (Safavid, Afsharid, and Qajar) Empires: mostly, the Ottomans ruled the West of the country, the Persians the East, while generally allowing autonomous Georgian kingdoms to subsist under their control. With the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Georgian Christians had lost their traditional recourse against Muslims, and were left to themselves.\nNew martyrs were canonized by the Church after each invasion, most notably Queen Ketevan of Kakheti, who was tortured to death in 1624 for refusing to renounce Christianity on the orders of Abbas I of Persia (Shah-Abbas). Not all members of the royal families of Kartli and Kakheti were so faithful to the Church, though. Many of them, to gain Persian favor, and win the throne over their brothers, converted to Islam, or feigned to, such as David XI of Kartli (Daud Khan). Other noblemen, such as Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani, left the weakened local Church for Catholicism, as missionaries were bringing the printing press and western culture to Georgia around 1700. Only the emergence of a strong Orthodox power, the Russian Empire, could reinforce during the 18th century the status and prestige of the Church among the elites, and the shared Orthodoxy was a potent factor in the calls for Russian intervention in the Caucasus, to liberate Georgia from Muslim domination.\n\n\n=== The Church under Russian and Soviet rule ===\n\nIn 1801, the Kingdom of Kartl-Kakheti (Eastern Georgia) was occupied and annexed by the Russian Empire. On 18 July 1811, the autocephalous status of the Georgian Church was abolished by the Russian authorities, despite strong opposition in Georgia, and the Georgian Church was subjected to the synodical rule of the Russian Orthodox Church. From 1817, the metropolitan bishop, or exarch, in charge of the Church was an ethnic Russian, with no knowledge of the Georgian language and culture. The Georgian liturgy was suppressed and replaced with Church Slavonic, ancient frescoes were whitewashed from the walls of many churches, and publication of religious literature in Georgian heavily censored. The 19th century was a time of decline and disaffection, as the church buildings often fell into disrepair, and the trust of people in the institution was diminished by its Russification and corruption. Calls for autocephaly became heard again only after the intellectual national revival that started in the 1870s; the local clergy made such calls during the 1905 revolution, before being repressed again.Following the overthrow of the Tsar Nicholas II in March 1917, Georgia's bishops unilaterally restored the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church on 25 March 1917. These changes were not accepted by the Russian Orthodox Church. After the Red Army invasion of Georgia in 1921, the Georgian Orthodox Church was subjected to intense harassment. Hundreds of churches were closed by the atheist government and hundreds of monks were killed during Joseph Stalin's purges. The independence of the Georgian Orthodox Church was finally recognized by the Russian Orthodox Church on 31 October 1943: this move was ordered by Stalin as part of the war-time more tolerant policy towards Christianity in the Soviet Union. New anti-religious campaigns took place after the war, especially under Nikita Khrushchev. Corruption and infiltration by the security organs were also plaguing the Church. First signs of revival can be seen from the 1970s, when Eduard Shevardnadze, then secretary of the Georgian SSR's Communist Party, adopted a more tolerant stance, and new Patriarch Ilia II could from 1977 renovate derelict churches, and even build new ones. At the same time, nationalist dissidents such as Zviad Gamsakhurdia emphasized the Christian nature of their struggle against Communist power, and developed relations with Church officials that would come to fruition after 1989.\n\n\n== Present-day status ==\n\nOn 3 March 1990, the Patriarch of Constantinople recognized and approved the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church (which had in practice been exercised or at least claimed since the 5th century), as well as the Patriarchal honour of the Catholicos. Georgia's subsequent independence in 1991 saw a major revival in the fortunes of the Georgian Orthodox Church.\nThe special role of the Church in the history of the country is recognized in the Article 9 of the Constitution of Georgia; its status and relations with the state were further defined in the Constitutional Agreement, or Concordat, signed by President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze and Patriarch Ilia II on 14 October 2002. The Concordat notably recognizes Church ownership of all churches and monasteries, and grants it a special consultative role in government, especially in matters of education.\n\nMany churches and monasteries have been rebuilt or renovated since independence, often with help from the state or wealthy individuals. The Church has enjoyed good relations with all three Presidents of Georgia since independence was restored. However, tensions subsist within the Church itself regarding its participation in the ecumenical movement, which Patriarch Ilia II had endorsed (he served as head of the World Council of Churches between 1977 and 1983). Opposition to ecumenism was fueled by fears of massive proselytizing by Protestant denominations in Georgia. In 1997, faced with open dissension from leading monks, Ilia II rescinded Church participation in international ecumenical organizations, though he stopped short of denouncing ecumenism as \"heresy\". Opposition against Protestant missionary activity has remained strong in contemporary Georgia, and even led to episodes of violence. Separatism in Abkhazia has also affected the Church: the Eparchy of Sukhumi, regrouping Abkhaz clergy, proclaimed in 2009 its secession from the Georgian Orthodox Church to form a new Abkhazian Orthodox Church; this move remained however unrecognized by any other orthodox authorities, including the Russian Orthodox Church. The relations with the neighboring Armenian Apostolic Church have also been uneasy since independence, notably due to various conflicts about church ownership in both countries.\n83.9% of Georgia's population identified themselves as Orthodox in the 2002 census. In 2002, it was reported that there were 35 eparchies (dioceses) and about 600 churches within the Georgian Orthodox Church, served by 730 priests. The Georgian Orthodox Church has around 3,600,000 members within Georgia (no sources attempt to count members among the Georgian diaspora).\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\n=== Holy Synod ===\n\nThe Georgian Orthodox Church is managed by the Holy Synod, headed by the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia. The Holy Synod is the collective body of bishops of the Church. In addition to the Patriarch, the Synod comprises 38 members, including 25 metropolitan bishops, 5 archbishops and 7 simple bishops. As of 2012, the following bishops are members of the Holy Synod, in such hierarchical order:\nMetropolitan of Kutaisi and Gelati: Calistratos (Margalitashvili)\nMetropolitan of Chiatura and Sachkhere: Daniel (Datushvili)\nMetropolitan of Western Europe: Abraham (Garmeliya)\nMetropolitan of Tianeti and Pshav-Khevsureti: Tadeos (Ioramashvili)\nMetropolitan of Manglisi and Tsalka: Anania (Japaridze)\nMetropolitan of Margveti and Ubisi: Vakhtang (Akhvledani)\nMetropolitan of Tsilkani and Dusheti: Zosimas (Shioshvili)\nMetropolitan of Tqibuli and Terjola: Giorgi (Shalamberidze)\nMetropolitan of Urbnisi and Ruisi: Job (Akiashvili)\nMetropolitan of Alaverdi: David (Makharadze)\nMetropolitan of Nekresi: Sergios (Chekurishvili)\nMetropolitan of Shemokmedi: Joseph (Kikvadze)\nMetropolitan of Nikozi and Tskhinvali: Isaiah (Chanturia)\nMetropolitan of Borjomi and Bakuriani: Seraphim (Jojua)\nMetropolitan of Nikortsminda: Elise (Jokhadze)\nMetropolitan of Poti and Khobi: Grigori (Berbichashvili)\nMetropolitan of Akhalkalaki and Kumurdo: Nikoloz (Pachuashvili)\nMetropolitan of Akhaltsikhe and Tao-Klarjeti: Theodore (Chuadze)\nMetropolitan of Khoni and Samtredia: Saba (Gagiberiya)\nMetropolitan of Batumi, Lazeti, North America and Canada: Dimitri (Shiolashvili)\nMetropolitan of Vani and Baghdati: Anton (Buluhiya)\nMetropolitan of Zugdidi and Tsaishi: Gerasimos (Sharashenidze)\nMetropolitan of Samtavisi and Gori: Andria (Gvazava)\nMetropolitan of Chkondidi and Martvili: Petre (Tsaava)\nMetropolitan of Senaki, Chkhorotsqu and Australia: Shio (Mujiri)\nArchbishop of Tsageri and Lentekhi: Stepan (Kalaidzhishvili)\nArchbishop of Bodbe: David (Tikaradze)\nArchbishop of Stepantsminda and Khevi: Iegudiel (Tabatadze)\nArchbishop of Rustavi and Marneuli : Ioane (Gamrekeli)\nArchbishop of Dmanisi, Agarak-Tashiri, Great Britain and Ireland: Zenon (Iaradzhuli)\nBishop of Mestia and Upper Svaneti: Ilarion (Kitiashvili)\nBishop of Gurjaani and Velistsikhe: Euthymos (Lezhava)\nBishop of Ninotsminda and Sagarejo: Luka (Lomidze)\nBishop of Skhalta: Spiridon (Abuladze)\nBishop of Bolnisi: Ephrem (Gamrekelidze)\nBishop of Dedoplistsqaro and Hereti: Melchisedek (Khachidze)\nBishop of Gardabani and Martqopi: Jacob (Iakobishvili)\nBishop of Surami and Khashuri: Svimeon (Tsakashvili)\n\n\n=== Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia ===\n\nThe first head bishop of the Georgia Church to carry the title of Patriarch was Melkisedek I (1010\u20131033).

          "This Gallery still has NOT refunded me my tickets from when we went into lockdown in March and all museums were closed. I have asked 3 times now for the refund. Shocking really. Do you think I will ever get my money back...????",

          "Although all the adverts displayed Tut's golden mask, famous worldwide, inviting us to go to the exhibition, it was not included in the Saachi collection! We were very disappointed! I have seen exhibitions of Tut's artefacts three times in my life and, each time, the mask was",
          "Really enjoyed our trip to the Saatchi Gallery to see the Treasures of Tutankhamun's Exhibition - it was well worth a visit. The treasures were displayed well and it was amazing to see them so closely. I loved seeing King Tutankhamun's chair that he sat upon as a boy king -",
          "We were not able to visit the Tut exhibition due to the travel ban issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I contacted the organizers to cancel our tickets or postponed them to some time in the future. However, so far we have not got any response!",
          "Absolutely fascinating exhibition. This visit was on my \u201cbucket list\u201d and was given as a gift from my husband. We travelled via National coaches and a very pleasant trip down to London. Everything was perfect, the only problem was the room we were given was a very protective",
          "Visited this exhibition with my wife who is really into history and particularly Tutankhamen. Must admit I was not that interested in going. However I found the exhibits fascinating and I could have stayed all day. As it was the weekend before the gallery was forced to shut due",
          "Very well laid out museum and this exhibition was well curated. Very nice staff and lovely coffee shop . But the added extras could have made it a bit expensive.",
          "Spent two hours at the Tutankhamen exhibition well laid out exhibition, flowed very well. Not rushed at all. Definite visit to recommend",
          "The treasures are fantastic. The galleries are large enough for the amount of people in each time slot. There is no rush to get round each room so you can enjoy each case for as long as you wish to. The 3D animations were particularly good, very informative. There is an option",
          "My brother took me to the British Museum in 1972 but he didn\u2019t get tickets and we couldn\u2019t get to see the exhibition. Got to see this one though and it was well worth it even though expensive to get in. Booked the audio guide although I think the info on the displays was just as",
          "Went to London to see the tutankhamun exhibit well worth a visit to see the many treasures of the boy king before they go back to Egypt",
          "The Tutankhamen exhibition is on and it really is amazing. I am so glad we went. We only had to queue for about 10 minutes at a 2.30pm appointment and considering the number of people attending thought that not bad. The displays were just amazing and we recommend everyone to",
          "We bought our tix months ago online for a weekday; arrived an hour early and there was no queue to get through security. The exhibit is wonderful - audio commentary is well done; lighting is good. Lots of stairs but there are lifts for those who want / need them. The Saatchi",

I don\u2019t think the video at the start helps either as everyone is grouped together and then just let loose in the next room which just creates a massive queue for everything. For \u00a327 each, I",

          "Read some reviews and followed advise to book in the evening. Suggested 60 - 90 minutes so we allowed 2 hours which was about right for us. Didn't like being photographed before entering the actual Exhibition without being told first that it was for a photograph you could buy",
          "Even if you have no interest in Ancient Egypt, this exhibition is still a must see, don't miss it. The curators have chosen a wide mix of material from the tomb, from mummified food carefully wrapped, to stunning funerary items never designed to be seen again by human eyes, but",
          "I was really excited to see the exhibition. We had booked our tickets for 19:30 and knew it was going to take about an hour and a half to do the whole tour. The gallery had confirmed it was closing at 9pm. So we knew it would be plenty of time to see everything. I was really",

On making your way in your herded into a \u201ctime sensitive\u201d slot, you watch a televised item about the tomb and then all of you (about 100) are \u201clet loose\u201d into the gallery. This",

          "We were looking forward to the exhibition as a precursor to our Nile cruise later this month. Our arrival slot was 10.30-11.00am. and we were able to walk straight into the gallery and just had a short wait for the video. However, once inside the exhibition proper it was",
          "Its very well laid out and very interesting i've been to the British museum and its more modern in terms of display. but don't miss the VR on the upper floor. We visited on the 5th March in the morning despite torrential rain and cold wind and Corona scares it was really",

          "Went on a bus trip to see this amazing exhibition, we had a fabulous time. Display was fantastic, lots of information about the exhibits, yes it\u2019s busy but what can you expect at such an important display, after all this is the last time you\u2019ll get to see them outside Egypt. We",
          "Great exhibition. One of our party was in a electric wheelchair. Staff where brilliant. Can't praise them enough. Would definitely recommend this gallery. Nice cafe as well !",
          "The Tutankhamen exhibition certainly is popular and crowded, but as it is said it will never travel outside Egypt again once their new museum is finished, it seems that a visit is a \u2018must\u2019 if you can possibly manage it. Fortunately there were explanations up above the showcases,",
          "went here to see the Tutankhamun exhibition, fantastic exhibits but very busy so getting close to the items was difficult. certainly worth a viewing.",
          "Really enjoyed this. Although other reviewers have said it was too crowded, I didnt find it a problem (apart from the very beginning, all crowded into the entrance room waiting for our time slot to open). Once inside, it was fine and I had no problem in seeing everything",
          "Can't really comment on the gallery as there only for the echibition, which was amazing. Gallery organised and presented it very well.",
          "Fascinating and well displayed but way too many people allowed in at once to be able to take any of it in properly. \u00a3120 for 4 people and none of us were able to read the descriptions due to crowds and queues around the artefacts. What angered me was when a member of staff",
          "We had a great few hours walking around the Gallery, and as a relative of Howard Carter it was great to actually see some of the many treasures he would have held and discovered. My only gripe was that at the very first section when you are standing listening to the story,",
          "Went to Tutankhamen exhibition early on Monday morning. The display was superb and worth the entrance fee. Lots of interpretation that was very interesting and our questions to a team member were very well answered. Some things spoilt the visit that could easily be addressed.",
          "We had a designated time for the Tutankhamun Exhibition and did not have to queue before entering. The exhibits was well laid out and if you waited a few minutes for the first people to finish there was ample room to see and read all about the exhibit. We thoroughly enjoyed",
          "Very well organised and set out. Was a quite busy, even though a Monday morning, but all exhibits were easy to study and had descriptions placed hig so easy to read.",
          "Yes it was overcrowded but i would still really recommend a visit if your a fan of the ancients. All these popular exhibitions are always packed anyhow in my experience, the Tate is the same..popularity = overcrowding unfortunately. Try and go on a weekday instead of the",
          "Although the exhibition was well laid out and very interesting, there were far too many people being let through at one time and once in the exhibition we were unable to read about the artefacts and by about half way I had given up and was just reading the wall displays as",
          "We visited the tutankamun exhibition with our 11 yr old grandson I booked online, very easy to use, well designed web site. Arrived in the middle of our 1/2 hour slot time, very slick fastest track entry for pre-book visitors You initially go into a video area for an intro, then",
          "I took my family to visit this once in a lifetime event. The exhibition itself was very impressive but I think that this gallery was not the ideal Choi to host such a major display. Firstly, people had to queue outside in all weathers until after the designated entrance time.",
          "The Tutankhamun exhibition is fabulous, took my little girl, she loved it. I wish my parent\u2019s had taken me to the one in72/3 visit in Feb!",
          "Wow. Where do I start? If you are interested in ancient Egypt this visit is a must before the treasures go back to Cairo for good. Superbly displayed in 5 gallery\u2019s with some having audio information.Yes it\u2019s crowded but that didn\u2019t bother me at all as you can you go round at",
          "Went to see Tutonkhamon's Treasures. It was half term so busy, visited at 12.30 p.m. Had to queue up four about 15 minutes, bags searched outside.....Nothing special inside, the rooms large.",
          "I thought the experience was marvellous wonderful to experience and I\u2019m so pleased i got to see it. My only criticism is I don\u2019t think its set up to let people flow through if that makes sense, its the actual set up i think could be better. Apart from that is an incredible",
          "Yes it is crowded, but if you\u2019re patient you can get really close to the cases - nose touching the glass - and spend as long as you like. We were there 2.5 hours and saw and read everything, and had 2 visits for a rest and refresh in the cafe. Overall a good show and worth the",
          "Wonderful display, clearly labelled, well positioned and plenty of information/explanations. Our party expected to wait in line, but we didn't have to wait long. Only downside was the number of people allowed in at any one time. It was crowded and hard to get to the exhibits. Of",
          "Fabulous exhibit but was so disappointed that there were not more of the larger pieces shown, even if only as copies. There were a lot people but still managed to see the exhibits close up and the explanations were excellent. Would recommend but don't expect to see any of the",
          "Very orderly queuing to get in, all timed tickets, once inside you could take as long as you wanted to look at the exhibits and discover about the symbolism and history. We had an audio guide which I find easier than reading everything. The way that the gallery is laid out,",
          "The King Tut exhibition was fabulous with artefacts of the most amazing quality and finery. The exhibits were well presented, provided with good explanations and easily accessible. Most exhibits could be accessed from both sides. There was way too many people in the halls though",
          "Visited the Tutankhamen exhibition which we knew would be very popular. The volume of visitors was managed well though there were times we needed to wait patiently for a better vantage point. Exhibits were spectacular and the self guided commentary was a worthwhile extra. We",

          "Couldn't be happier with my visit to the saatchi gallery to see the king tut exhibition. It was very busy and you did have to be patient to see the artifacts but this didn't take anything away from what was a wonderful experience. It is beautifully staged over several galleries.",
          "We visited the Tutankhamun exhibition at 10 am on the Saturday the 15th of February. We arrived early and was told stand to one side as they were still taking the 9:30 bookings through. We started queuing at 9:40 for the 10 a.m. booking tickets for scan straight away bags",
          "Visited the Tutankhamen exhibition today and was impressed - given the space totally understand the time range restrictions. The exhibition is well laid out and glad to see so much dig footage- will be recommending without doubt.",
          "Thought we better go now before the exhibits go back to Egypt. The staff said that on the day we went that it wasn\u2019t a particularly busy day but nevertheless there we plenty enough people in there. Very glad not to have been there when it is busy or else it would have spoilt",
          "Visited at 10.30 on a Wednesday morning and walked straight in. It was a privilege to see such beautiful items. A little patience is needed to allow time for everyone to view the items but if you hang back a little and allow others first we found we had plenty of time and easier",
          "This gallery is not particularly big but is in an elegant re-purposed building. Indeed it was quite hard to locate since some (old) maps still show it as military headquarters. It is named only by temporary banners. Facilities provided are all that you'd expect. Queues, for",
          "Had the privilege of a private viewing and dinner at the gallery and it was outstanding in every way. Recommended",
          "Very interesting and well laid out tour of exhibits. Seems to be always busy but the timed controls keep in flowing. Would recommend yo get to see these treasures while you can!",
          "Knowing this was the last time these artifacts would be on tour it was an absolute must to see this exhibition. We booked a 3pm slot and when we got there we were more or less ushered in straight away. Not going to give anything away other than to say the displays are well",
          "We visited the Tutenkamen exhibition yesterday. Our time slot was 10am and when we arrived early at 9:20am there was a queue of about 20 people. After a couple of minutes we were able to go in. As there were only a few people we are able to see all the exhibits clearly and spend",

          "A very special day with or without children.Only a short walk from the tube station so easy to find. We asked for directions from the station attendant. Nice shops and cafes nearby if you are on a timed slot.We went to a French Patisserie across the road which was great.",

          "What a lovely gallery. I knew this exhibition would be busy,but the gallery were very well organised. Only a short wait out side even though the queues where long. Once inside it felt busy but only at the beginning. You can spend as little or as long as you like looking at the",
          "Just loved this. We arrived an hour early, for our mid week visit and we were let in straight away. It was very quiet at 9.30am with plenty of time to look at all exhibits from every angle. A stunning display, the detail in the pieces and the state of preservation is",
          "Long queues to get into venue but once inside flowed fairly smoothly. Well put together with many interesting artifacts. Audio tour for a little extra worth the money. Main criticism is that too many people allowed in at once which made it a bit stuffy but otherwise a good",
          "Tutankamoon exhibition excellent trip. Would recommend a visit. The gallery was set out well and no queues. The only thing that I would say is that it would have been better to have details of drop off.e.g. area and available time on the coach on the way down so as to make",

          "So easily accessible via Sloane Sq tube....took advantage of the cloakroom and ore-ordered tickets and audio guides then entered one of 5 galleries with the stunning Tutenkamun exhibition.... No golden face as it is not allowed out of Egypt, but a replica mummy and a rich",
          "Booked this some time ago, having read reviews was pleasantly surprised there were no queues or problems having to wait very long. When you get into the auditorium to watch a short film there are a lot of people, once everyone disperses it\u2019s worth waiting until people move on a",
          "We booked to see the exhibition as soon as I saw it being advertised. Having been to the previous Tutankhamun exhibition and also to the Cairo museum we were interested to see what new exhibits would be on display. Tickets have a set time to enter, ours was 1pm and eventually",
          "Excellent exihibtion and worth a visit as none of this stuff is likely to be seen outside of Egypt again, once the new facilities there are complete. Quite well organised and spread between a number of galleries within the building. We went on a Monday, with advance tickets, and",

          "Great museum with a lot to see. Iv been to loads of galleries and this one had a very nice cafe. I recommend it.",
          "You can only really judge a gallery like this by the quality of its exhibit, in this case it was very impressive. We arrived 15 minutes before our entry time, 9.30 on a saturday morning, the queue was already pretty long, but we were sheperded in on time and can have no",
          "Well organised exhibition, lots of interesting stuff, kept our grandchildren\u2019s attention throughout(aged 4-6 years). Easy access at appointed time. If you arrive early there is a excellent cafe/grocery called Partridges opposite which was surprisingly reasonable.",

          "If you are in London for a visit, you have to take the time to visit the Saatchi Gallery and the Tutankhamen Exhibition. It\u2019s not the cheapest ticket in town but worth every penny once you have seen the exhibit. The gallery itself is a beautiful building and the exhibits on show",
          "We visited on a Thursday afternoon. Booked tickets for 3:00 and the process of checks and entering was very smooth. Initially it seemed a bit crowded, a woman in a wheelchair was having real issues, but after the first room it seemed to thin out and after that no problems. The",
          "Awesome! You have really done a brilliant work with this exhibition. The only down for me was the lack of storage for luggage. I guess it was due to lack of space and security. But the quality and efficiency of the exhibition made up for this. Staff young dynamic and efficient",

          "Have seen a number of the treasures in Egypt but thought that this \"last time\" exhibition of Tutankhamen would be worth a look. Indeed it was. Expensive but not too much so. We spent just under two hours in there. Lots to see, very well displayed with informative captions which",
          "Our cause to visit was the Tutankhamen exhibition. Booked in advance, the queues were extensive but moved along at the right times. All the exhibits were well laid out, not on top of one another, crowds inside well managed and plenty of opportunity to pause and sit. Super job",

          "I think it\u2019s fair to say that the TUTANKHAMUN: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh is billed as one of \u201cthe\u201d exhibits one can visit.

          "I have not visited the saatchi gallery before so did not know what to expect but they have done a very good job displaying the Tutankhamen artifacts. It was a very enjoyable experience and would consider any future events they put on.",
          "The whole experience from start to finish was truly amazing. If I had any negative points it would be the lack of crowd control in the exhibition. Especially with those using the audio tour who hold up everyone else. There were a number of children bored and sitting in corners",

          "Great exhibition, but long queues to get in meaning we overran our time slot considerably. And being on an organised coach trip, leaving at 1pm, with a 20 minute walk either way left us little time to see everything. Just something to be aware of. The staff were outstanding,",

          "What an amazing exhibition. Go while you get the chance, this is the last time these artefacts will be seen outside of Eqypt. It was truly amazing, the craftsmanship of the items incredibly made over 3300 years ago is mind-blowing. It's so moving to see all these things, made",
          "We have been studying Tutankhamun for ages, and have been to Cairo to see the death mask. I was blown away by just how many quality items are on display at the Saatchi Gallery, and so well displayed. Do not expect the most valuable items to be here (death mask, solid gold",

          "This is a very busy attraction, and well worthwhile. As such it is better to book tickets in advance (with audio guide). Allow about 20 minutes for queuing, bag checks etc. You queue outside so dress appropriately. When you are in, prepare to be amazed. Take time to absorb",
          "Came here on a national holidays tour. Our tickets were booked for 11am and we got in the queue just before 11am we had our bags checked then headed into the gallery. The tutankhamun exhibition was amazing and well layout so you can see and read everything, some the description",

          "As an avid reader of anything Egyptian, this was an exhibition that could not be missed. Having read a little more about it and the estimated 60-90 minutes I did wonder if it would be worthwhile, but those fears were unfounded and we spent well over 2 hours meandering around",

          "We had a great time, I dont know where the time went!! we spent almost 2.5 hours there looking at the artifacts and enjoying the audio description which I would recommend. We finished our veiwing with the extra VR experience which gave us an experience of going into the tomb and",

          "Anyone Interested in this subject get ready to be blown away. The Tutankhamun Exhibition is amazing the exhibition itself is fabulously put together the whole experience is awesome. But the artifacts are mind blowing the detail in the exhibits in Unbelievable . The gallery",
          "Too many people and gallery is not big enough. People taking 20 close up pictures of every exhibit blocking view of others. Really quite an unpleasant experience",
          "We had a lovely time at this exhibition, it was very well put together. We found the cafe to be very light and airy, serving a good selection of light eats",
          "From the moment I stepped into the first room and saw 5000+ year old vases that looked like new I was mesmerised. Brilliantly put together this exhibition of the treasures of Tutankhamun was well displayed and led us through from the young boys life to his death and with it hope",
          "The King Tut pieces are truly exquisite however the experience and enjoyment was seriously marred by the fact that there are just too many people admitted to the venue at the same time and so it meant everyone was crowded around exhibits at the same time meaning only partial",
          "Came with some friends to see King Tut exhibit. Was really impressed with the organisation out the front for queueing people ready to go in. It was common sense but how often do you see that common sense in action at places like this. Thank you staff for that. Really well",
          "Located in the Chelsea neighborhood, the Saatchi Gallery is a contemporary art museum which opened in 1985 to showcase the art collection of Charles Saatchi. However, through 3 May 2020 the Saatchi hosts the PHENOMENAL \u201cTutankhamun Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh\u201d exhibit. This",
          "Very poor organisation not worth the time spent queuing would not recommend exhibition oK not good !!!!!!!",
          "Really enjoyed my visit to see King Tut exhibition. Was busy when I got there but had really quieted down by the time I left at 5.15, which seems like the best time to go. Much as I thought highly of the display and the items, the really famous objects from the tomb weren't",
          "The 100th anniversiary King Tut exhibit is not to be missed. It has a number of items never previosuly exhibited outside Egypt and key items that have been previosly shown in the travelling exhibits. I spent about 90 minutes viewing the items and enjoyed it greatly.",
          "We arrived & went straight to the queues!! As we\u2019d arrived early, we were asked to return 15 minutes before our allocated slot which was printed on our ticket.Going back again to the queues,there were four columns of people. It was very busy & finally we got inside, later than",
          "A wonderful exhibit with many items being displayed outside of Egypt for the very first time. The staff couldn\u2019t have been more friendly and helpful. The virtual reality experience was out of this world. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Visited on Tuesday at 11:00, having booked months back, emails from Saatchi made sure we didn't arrive early! About 10 mins queuing (yes it was raining!)charming helpful young staff and we were in by 11:10. Kept our coats as cloakroom pricy. Atmosphere,lighting and background",
          "I couldn't wait to visit as not been to Egypt, wasn't disappointed when I saw the treasures, was amazing to see them knowing they were over 3000 years old. The queuing wasn't too bad and getting the headsets was a good idea as more interesting info to be heard (especially",
          "While I found it a great exhibition with fabulous artefacts (albeit no death mask which is used everywhere in their promotional matter, a bit of a con) there are just too many people jostling to see everything. Even though you have tickets for a specific time, you have to queue",
          "The exhibition was beautifully presented. The timed tickets make sure there aren't too many people in each room. The audio tour brought the story to life and explained the significance of each piece. A great promotional tour which will make a visit to Cairo to see the rest of",
          "Yes, we had to wait in a queue whilst security searches were undertaken, unfortunately a necessity these days. However, having visited the Cairo Museum many years ago I was impressed by the way these exhibits were so beautifully lit and displayed. The information was excellent",
          "It was disappointing that even with pre-booked timed tickets one has to queue outside for half an hour, in the rain in our case as there is no covered waiting area. The galleries were over crowded and it was difficult to see the exhibits of which there were far fewer than",
          "Visited on Sunday and booked it a long time ago. I saw that there were no tickets available for the day, when we arrived at 11 30, so book well in advance, or take a pre booked excursion with accommodation. Waited for 30 minutes to get in, as advised in an e-mail.received. After",
          "First and foremost The Tutankhamun exhibits simply Have to be seen! They are beyond exquisite. That\u2019s the positive. Saatchi either haven\u2019t got a clue or worse they have but do not care and are supremely happy to: 1. Even with pre bought, timed entry tickets, force you to queue",
          "Being fascinated by Egyptology and having been on a Nile Cruise and visit to Cairo this exhibition was a must to go and see. The way the artefacts were presented was fantastic being well lit and housed. The chronological order of what is there is well done and the storytelling",
          "Booked this back in April and we were both looking forward to this exhibition. I\u2019ve seen some exhibits in Cairo museum. Arrived early for our time slot only then to wait another hour (in the rain). Organisation was an utter shambles. Organisers were being greedy and allowing",
          "An Awesome Exhibition that will take your breath away. Many items at the exhibit have travelled out of Egypt for the first time. Although the famous death mask is not part of the exhibit - this is not a disappointment as the number of exhibits and the storytelling is so amazing.",
          "Visited the exhibition on Sunday 24th November. As other people have mentioned it is hot in there and definitely no need for a coat, so worth dropping your coat in the cloakroom as soon as you enter under the big columns into the building. Lots of children I saw were desperate",
          "An absolutely fantastic exhibition. Get the audio cause you\u2019ll learn so much more. It is worth the cost and cheaper if you book in advance. We did the virtual (VR) experience too. It is not cheap but is very good.",
          "Good content, massively frustrating experience. This is so badly organised. You will be waiting outside for 30 to 45 mins so don\u2019t arrive early as suggested. You then enter.... to wait, while they try to sell you a photo and audio. You then enter the next room to... wait....as",
          "Echo the comments already made. Its Monday morning approaching midday and we were entering the gallery. It wasn\u2019t long before we were wedged in moving around. The artefacts were simply jaw dropping, looking pristine as though they had only recently been made. Incredible effort",
          "Nice setting for the exhibits and not too many people due to the entry time. Learned some new information and really liked the virtual reality experience. Cafe was ok too. The only drawback was the cost which was high and did not purchase in the shop as a key ring was \u00a37!",
          "My daughter and I attended thTutankhamun Exhibition on Sunday 24th of November and had a fantastic day. The Saatchi Gallery have done a wonderful job with the display, well laid out and with excellent lighting. The exhibits were easily accessible for the young and old. There",
          "Crowded,hot to many people crammed in so hard to stop and view anything properly and not really much to see. Expensive for what it is,came away disappointed and mugged.",
          "This will be the last time that the treasures from the King's tomb will be loaned to other countries, the exhibition runs until May, it is brilliant. If you are interested in Egyptology, this is for you. The death mask is not in London (it is the main reason why people flock to",
          "Visited here to see the tutenkamun exhibition. The gallery did a great job putting together an interactive experience. All the pieces were well lit and accessible. Gallery was well laid out and staff were at hand to provide any guidance. Great experience. Phenomenal exhibit.",
          "This is a popular exhibition, with the largest ever number of pieces from the Tutankhamun burial chambers ever seen outside Egypt. Once this exhibition ends next May, all these pieces will return to their new museum, and will never leave Egypt again. It is fascinating to see",
          "Having booked tickets for 1pm, we waited patiently in the queue and didn't have to wait too long to enter the exhibition. Once inside you have a chance to have your picture taken & watch a short video giving a bit of background about Tut before proceeding to the exhibition.",
          "I have a vivid memory of the crowds queuing around the block to see the British Museum exhibition in 1972 and so quickly booked tickets for this last chance to see these amazing artefacts outside of Egypt. One of our party was in a wheelchair and the staff were really helpful in",
          "We had 10:30 tix for a Tuesday morning and arrived about 9:45. Got in line for a somewhat short cue & waited for a little bit before the bag check/entry. Didn\u2019t use the cloakroom but it was right at the entrance. Lead to anteroom to wait until all ticketed arrived, passed the",
          "Well presented. Be aware that King Tut's gold mask used in the advertising material is not in fact on display. It's unlikely now to ever leave the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza. The exhibition cases are presented so they can readily be viewed from both sides, being located",
          "Not a gallery I enjoy find it very stark. However this exhibition was well laid out and I would recommend it especially with children.",
          "We visited the Tutankhamen Exhibition at the Daatchi Gallery having bought a hotel and ticket offer We had tickets for 10.30 and when we arrived the queues were already forming We stood in our time queue for almost 30 mins but then were ushered inside where coats and bags could",
          "Really pleased we had the chance to visit,on Sat 23/11 tickets for 13.15.......... fabulous exhibition, but could do with a few tweaks! Negs out of the way....... Everything written only in English....suited us but not for all, In a Q... then another...oops and another.........",
          "I bought the tickets for this in the spring.. so exciting, couldnt wait to go. We got there in plenty of time, half an hour before our timed ticket. We got in early.. Hurded like cattle, we went through bag check and in to a holding room where we had out photo took, some",
          "Queuing system to get in was quick and efficient. Was very busy inside so took a while to see everything but definitely worth a visit. Amazing artefacts and well written information. Audio guide is \u00a36 extra.",
          "We came to see the FANTASTIC Tutanachamon exhibition and my only complaint was that they sold too many tickets that the place was so packed that it made it difficult to see the showcases. It took us nearly 2 hours to walk through the entire exhibition.",
          "I visited on Saturday with an entry time of 10 am. I queued for no more than 15 minutes before I was into the main exhibition. It was busy but I wouldn\u2019t say it was too overcrowded. Some people did hog the exhibits to take photos with their professional cameras but most",
          "Recently visited the Tutankhamun Exhibition & had a great time. Queuing wasn\u2019t as bad as expected as we were at the front having arrived 15 minutes prior to our selected time. Quite crowded inside & very warm. We paid an extra \u00a35 for the audio commentary which was a complete",
          "Very efficient queuing system to get in. Audio guide was VERY good. Would recommend. It cost \u00a36 and is quiet to hear so take earphones so you can plug them in. WONDERFUL selection of artifacts. The famous mask is not there which I personally didn't mind but I expect many will as",
          "Visited the gallery to see the Tutankhamun exhibition. Was not disappointed with the artefacts on display and the way the exhibition had been created enabled the boy Pharaoh\u2019s story to unfold. As is usual with all exhibitions you have the general public who stand in front of",
          "Saatchi have really gone out to make maximum profit out of this. Despite timed entry, we queued for around 45 minutes after our timed slot to get inside the building (luckily it was not raining!). To add insult to expensive injury, we then queued some more for the dubious",
          "Very good Exhibition. Plenty of time to go round at your own pace. Information was just right. Well laid out. If there was one thing that was annoying it was people taking photos. Some took 3 or 4 of the same item. This meant they hogged the exhibit. Facilities were",
          "The exhibition was as good as we expected it would be. The staff, both inside and outside, could not have been friendlier and more helpful, and they helped to make our visit the success it was.",
          "The exhibition itself was marvellous. The settings were atmospheric and showed off the exhibits at their best. It was a real treat and I would recommend a visit. The only downsides to the day were 1) the queue system, we arrived around 12.45 for the 1pm entry, the queue was",
          "The saatchi gallery was a fantastic place with many things to see the treasures of King tut were amazing you must visit this fabulous place of wonder and magic as there are over 50 things from his own tomb that were over 3000 years old beware of the que though don't get there at",
          "I visited the Saatchi Gallery with my adult son to see the Tutankhamun exhibition on a midweek day with a pre booked \u2018timed entry\u2019 ticket just before midday. We bought our tickets online at \u00a324.50 per person which I thought was quite a competitive price though the additional",
          "Very good bought tickets on the day had to wait about20/30mins. Only disappointment was the gold mask was not there. Although I have seen it before I would have liked to see it again.",
          "Me and my class went on a school trip to explore about our school topic: Pharaohs. We got there early (before 10) so we had to wait outside for a few minutes - freezing cold. We finally went in and had to wait in a queue. We skipped the photo as that would just take our precious",
          "I was excited to see the Tutankhaums treasures recovered by Howard Carter. Arrived with our timed tickets and told to wait until 15 mins before our time to come back. The queue was getting very long on our return, they let in a couple at a time, you are greeted by a",
          "What a wonderful experience to see all these fantastic treasures in the UK. I never thought I would get to see them in my life time having missed the last time back in the 70s (?). Was a little disappointed that the Death Mask wasn't there but there was so much else. The staff",
          "Being given a chance to see these amazing treasures is incredible Wish some people would have appreciated the experience a little bit more Lots of pushing and shoving with some constantly taking pictures on phones Personally I appreciated every minute of the hour and a half we",
          "A dream to finally see the Tutankhamun exhibition. Each artifact is a stunning piece of artwork that has been preserved beautifully considering its age. A little disappointed that there wasn\u2019t more on display, or that the Face Mask and more of the more famous treasures found by",
          "My expectations were very high so I came away a little disappointed. The exhibits of statues, jewellery and caskets etc were well lit and you can take photos provided you don't use flash. However despite timed tickets it is crowded and the descriptions are frequently only on",
          "This was an excellent display of 150 artefacts, some of which I had not see before and I\u2019ve been to Cairo twice and all the London exhibitions back to 1972. This exhibition was equally as good as the British Museum one. There was plenty of room to look at the objects from all",
          "If you enjoy being pushed and shoved, this is the place for you. On the whole, the exhibition wasn\u2019t too bad but it was made difficult by people who lacked manners and a school trip who seemed to think they had a right to get to the front. If you go into the shop you will find",
          "Worth going for the historical significance. But be prepared for crowds and badly organised. Too many people let in at 1 time.",
          "Am amazing exhibition of these priceless objects, many never seen out of Egypt before. They are well presented, and well documented with clear and full explanations. The only issue is the amount of people visiting make sometimes for difficulties to see everything properly. Take",
          "Purchased tickets for the exhibition at 10am. Arrived around 20 mins early but already had to join a long queue. The queue was moved, then split into smaller queues, then each one got called up for a bag search and entry into the building. Once in, we had to pay to use the",
          "We visited on Sunday and only had a short wait in the queue as it was well organised. The exhibition itself is superb with well laid out artefacts and information. Only downside was the number of people inside but if you were patient you got to see everything. Bonus that you",
          "A lot of the marketing uses the DeathMask a having visited the exhibition yesterday i feel that they a misleading the public, but it is a good exhibition",
          "I\u2019m not going to bend your ear for hours; but the bottom line is clear. Over 5,000 artefacts were recorded, yet less 50 were on display at the Saatchi gallery. They allowed groups of 40 people in every 5-10 minutes; and this led to over crowding and an unpleasant viewing",
          "Good to see wonder artifacts that are thousands of years old the craftsmanship wonderful. Expo laid out well and you could see all the exhibits up close.",
          "Booked package deal. Timed visit and in exhibit within 10 minutes of due time.Well organised with friendly staff. Well laid out and sympathetic design. Items were stunning and first time e hi it\u2019s identified in explanation boards. Extra \u00a36 gets you an Audio on disruption.",
          "What and incredible exhibition. Just the right number of pieces - perfect amount of detail and really good crowd control. We also booked the virtual reality experience which should not be missed. We went on a very cold day so had a lot of The cloakroom is a bit expensive so",
          "Access to the Gallery on a Saturday evening in November was fine - no queues (but this might have been because the Circle and District lines were closed for engineering work). The exhibition was busy without being overcrowded but the layout was such that the displays could",
          "This is was I emailed to the organisers - and they don\u2019t even bother to reply. \u201cJust wanted to let you know that we visited the exhibition today and it was unfortunately extremely disappointing for the following reasons: You had only one person at some times scanning tickets",
          "Where to begin. Well, at the beginning would be a good start. We arrived 25 minutes before our allotted time. The queue was already very long. Eventually we got into the gallery, only a few minutes after the time on our tickets. Then we joined another queue inside. The exhibits",
          "We inadvertently bought 10am tickets, which seemed a bit early for us to travel there. However, when we saw the queues on exiting we were so pleased we had early tickets. We had ample time to see all the exhibits, which were amazing with some having left Egypt for the first",
          "This was fantastic and great value, and you were not rushed through the gallery. You were able to take photos and lots of seating all around.",
          "Having booked tickets for a Friday afternoon in advance, we arrived 15 mins early as advised to face a sea of hundreds of people standing in the cold and rain, waiting for their entrance slot. Not enough guides in the queue to advise which queue to stand in resulting in many",
          "Had prebooked tickets for this exhibition and found the organisation to be very good - it was extremely busy but the queue to enter moved quickly enough. You can move round the 4 galleries at your own pace and the info panels are clear and well lit. The exhibition is amazing",
          "Located at the Saatchi Gallery and needing booking well in advance was the Tutankhamen exhibition across five galleries with around 150 excellent pieces from the tomb. They were very well presented with explanations. Although very busy indeed you could still see every piece with",
          "Amazing exhibition was a bit crowded but the staff sorting the lines were very good and we enjoyed our visit immensely. We did visit the Valley of the Kings in 2011 on a Nile cruise and had a choice of three tombs to enter. We were advised not to go into Tutankhamuns as there",
          "So I was a little concerned about having to wait in line for ages and being pushed and shoved however we arrived to no queue at all and actually was let in 30 mins early?! Once inside it was a tad crowded and definitely do not need a coat but you can still see everything just",
          "The exhibits were amazing, the craftsmanship unbelievable. What was disappointing was the number of tickets sold during each time slot and cost of the book. It would have been lovely to just sit and savour the items on display but this was impossible due to the number of",
          "Very interesting exhibition, well presented. We were very disappointed that the major items ie. The sarcophagus and Tutankamun's death mask were not here. We assumed that because all the adverts for the exhibition showed the death mask, then it would be on show. Although it was",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful opportunity which for me was once in a lifetime. Our tickets were for 2.30 pm. We arrived at 2.15 pm as advised and we queued until 3.05 pm. The queues were orderly and staff did direct everyone to the correct timed queue. We were lucky that",
          "In spite of having bought timed tickets we waited for 50 minutes after our allocated time before finally being admitted to the first room where an interesting film was shown. Fortunately it was a dry afternoon although it was very cold; the long queues were frustrating and",
          "Wonderful things indeed, fabulous exhibition and stunning layout. Spread over 5 rooms the 150 exhibits in the exhibition are almost perfectly laid out for viewing, it is perfectly lit and brings out the best in the 3000 yr old artifacts. Yes there are crowds but well controlled",
          "A brilliant exhibition, beautifully staged, excellent audio guide. So many wonders to see, but time provided.",
          "We did this on a coach tour and had a timed ticket for 11am. The coach got us there for 10am, the driver asked if we could go in early but it was very busy so they said come back at 10.30 - fair enough. My advice is turn up st least 15 minutes before your allotted time, you do",
          "Amazing tour. Incredibly well organized, interactive and filled with tons of info about the period, the man, etc. Last time all these will be seen any other place than Egyptian new museum of history due to open next year.",
          "I cant believe the people who are complaining about queuing and crowds. Its a major exhibition, expect and accept it, stop moaning. I class myself as very lucky being able to visit this exhibition, a once in a lifetime experience. Yes, its crowded, but not pushy. You can view",
          "Have just returned form the Saatchi gallery, having been today to see the treasures of Tutankhamun. What a wonderful exhibition spread out over five different rooms. All artefacts were well displayed in lit up glass cases, you could walk round the whole case to see things from",
          "I was a child when the exhibition came to London in the 70s but sadly was unable to go but my interest always stayed with me so when I heard of this exhibition I planned a trip to London to coincide with it. I booked to take my young daughter who has special needs and we were",
          "Don\u2019t miss this tour. Very well presented by the gallery., my advice is have a tour radio it adds to the knowledge and experience.",
          "Just went through the new display on King Tut's tomb and it's treasures. Beautifully annotated and described. Well worth the once in a lifetime opportunity to see this.",
          "Crowded, but moving at a reasonable pace. Exhibits well documented and visible close up. Engrossing. Ground floor galleries have irritating and unnecessary background \u201cmusic\u201d.",
          "We had booked tickets for the 12th when they first went on sale and after having read so many negative reviews on here we were fully prepared for a nightmare experience. WRONG! Yes, it was raining and cold but the queue for the 1pm entrance was very short and it only took",
          "I visited for the first time yesterday for the Tutankhamun exhibition. The exhibits were fantastic but the layout and signing very confusing. It really didn't flow well. Having stood outside in the cold for a while we needed the loo before starting which was on the lower level.",
          "Go and read all the \"terrible\" reviews and I agree with every one of them. We travelled all the way from the north of England to see this and the disappointment began with a 45 minute wait in the rain to get inside. It went downhill from there.",
          "Thanks to reading all the previous reviews, I set my expectations and summond all my patience on the day - definitely helped me to enjoy the experience. The gallery itself is in a pretty setting and there are loads of cafe/restaurants in the square nearby. Get there early and",
          "Very helpful staff as my partner is wheelchair bound and needed assistance. A fantastic exhibition of Egyptian artefacts some not see before out of Egypt. Very well laid out and despite the number of people it was possible to view everything. Second best only to the Cairo Museum.",
          "The artifacts were very well presented - it's amazing to think they made such beautiful things that long ago and that they have survived. Although the exhibition was very good the experience was spoiled by a number of issues First, we had problems with Ticketmaster only",
          "While the artefacts are wonderful the exhibit space is TO SMALL, far far to many people let in at once. Be prepared to que outside in the cold and to have to elbow your way inside to catch a glimpse of anything. Forget getting up close or reading any of the information. Not even",
          "I had booked tickets back in May for 2.30 slot. As many others have said , we were told to arrive 15 mins before our entry time. We arrived as instructed and were then told to go away and come back in another 15mins - by which time the queue was even longer. It did move quite",
          "Got in five minutes early. Yes there were queues. But people were very accommodating and we all gave each other enough time and space to look at the artefacts and take pictures etc. The artefacts are majestic felt really privileged to get to see things that Tutankhamun was",
          "There is no denying that the exhibits are amazing but the way the timed tickets are sold is dreadful. We visited early on a Monday afternoon in November. We were on time but had to queue outside for an unacceptable time and once we were in the exhibition it was packed so full",
          "We travelled to London with grandparents to see this with our children as a birthday treat. As the children are small when they began to get fractious we took them out for some fresh air (it was VERY crowded inside) and they would not let us back in. Please beware!",
          "Went at 11.30 Saturday and didn't feel the queuing was too bad although it was much longer when we were leaving. Place was a touch busier than I would have liked but it's popularity says it all and the exhibits are fantastic. The workmanship, skill and total oppulence of the",
          "We booked the 15.00 hours slot. The queue snaked right out to the street and in spite of the relatively high cost of tickets we still had had to wait another 20 to 30 minutes to gain access. Inside the crowd was intolerable, quite impossible to enjoy so for my part was a waste",
          "Agree with a lot of comments made in previous comments. I got there an hour earlier and was advised that my time slot (1.00 p.m.) would be queuing from 12.30 p.m. So do arrive early and go and get a coffee and cake to warm up before standing in the queue (recommend Partridges",
          "The exhibition is very good but there are far too many people let in at one time. It was very crowded, hot, with nowhere to sit. At times it was impossible to read the notices as some people were unwilling to move away from the cases. The gift shop is just ridiculously priced.",
          "well organised and planned layout. Gives everyone the chance to see everything. Good facilities, good customer flow control. excellent exhibits.",
          "This exhibition is unlikely to come to this country again and the artefacts are excellent and well displayed. My wife and I were lucky to have been able to see the last exhibition of Tutankhamun in 1972, so this was a good reminder. There seemed to be more artefacts this time",
          "Absolutely loved this exhibition. So many amazing artefacts, it just blew me away. Came away feeling inspired and wanting to learn more about Egyptian history. This is the first time that many of the pieces have left Egypt - you really should take advantage of it being in",
          "I thought the actual artefacts on show were very good, however the ridiculous amount of people that were allowed in per timed entrance meant that the place was absolutely heaving. Elderley, young and those in wheelchairs really struggled and for the rest of us were pushed and",
          "We went on Saturday the 09th Nov and it was raining, which is totally not the organisers fault. However, what is their fault is the total lack of effort to provide cover, decent direction, and/or movement of the crowds out of the deluge of rain and freezing cold. When we",

          "The Exhibits of the Treasures of Tutankhamun were excellent, while worth visiting and price very good. And I visited the exhibition in the 70's , also the Cairo museum. Only gave 4 out of five because of organisers seem to have got it wrong with the numbers !!!! Too crowded.",
          "I waited just over half an hour this afternoon before being allowed in. If like me, you have back problems, I suggest taking a shooting stick to perch on both whilst waiting and whilst going around the exhibition. If like me, you dislike constant intrusive 'background' music,",
          "I waited in line for only 30 mins and was let in about 15 mins past my ticket time. The exhibition was very busy but that is what I expected considering it's the last time to see these Tutankhamun artifacts. Lighting was awesome and the artifacts were amazing. I can't believe",

          "we waited months to see the exhibition. What a stunning show!! It's hard to believe these objects are over 3,000 years old as many appear contemporary and are so incredibly beautiful. Particularly enjoyed the narrative of the collection as it provides a real view into the",

          "Simply amazing exhibition of items taken from the tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun. Well worth a visit. Many of the items have never been seen outside Egypt. Expectations were managed well. I did not expect to see everything. There was a lot more than I expect. In fact",

          "Went to the Tutankhamun exhibition today! It was an incredible experience. Very crowded but everyone was polite and it was well managed with clear instructions as to where to go. Saatchi gallery is situated in a lovely space with lots of cafes and restaurants close by. All in all a fantastic afternoon!",
          "Visited the Saatchi gallery for the first time today to see the Tutenkaham exhibit. The collection was really cool, lots of interesting objects and they were displayed in a really engaging way where you could learn and experience them with \u2026",
          "Well worth the trip to see the gallery. The artefacts are all explained and well lit. The atmosphere is good and there is a plethora of information everywhere. The movies are short yet informative and the staff is friendly. The gift shop, \u2026",
          "Outstanding exhibition, from the short intro film to the end of the journey this was worth every penny, so many great items to see all displayed beautifully. spent over 3 hours here and then stopped for some refreshments in the caf\u00e9 downstairs. staff so helpful too.",
          "The Tutankhamun exhibition is absolutely astounding. Well worth the ticket price. Awe-inspiring collection of artefacts. Well-produced videos and clear explanatory captions. No queues the day we were there - 4.30 on a Friday afternoon. If you have any interest in history, you will be spellbound from start to finish.",
          "Easy location to find. Very organized. Staff super helpful. Good directions given for the exhibition. Spent a great amount of time viewing the exhibits, no rush. Gift shop very expensive hence no keepsake. Overall a lovely experience with everyone in the party enjoying it.",
          "We went Sunday 15th March, for the Tutankhamen exhibition was great very well laid out, although will say the glass cases some of the exhibits were in, could have positioned the exhibits better so the joins in the glass didn't interfere with the view.\nThe staff were brilliant with making sure things were clean.",
          "Tutankhamun Exhibition permanently  changed my understanding of the Book of Exodus. Offhand the most stunning crafts I have seen in my life. A must for educators.  Get the audio guide, listen for an option for.more after a few seconds at most stops, and do the virtual reality.  You will thank me.",
          "Well organised queues for the King Tut. exhibition.  Evocative lighting of the exhibits enhanced our visit.  Not too cramped with people meant we could enjoy the majesty of the items.",
          "I recently came here to see the Tutankhamen Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh exhibition and it was just brilliant! Wandering around the exhibition gave me a chance to see the beautiful artifacts that were found in the tomb and l was very impressive. I would highly recommend coming here.",
          "Wonderful place to visit. The Saatchi Gallery is a London gallery for contemporary art, opened by Charles Saatchi in 1985 in order to exhibit his collection to the public. It has occupied different premises, first in North London, then the South Bank by the River Thames, and finally in Chelsea, its current location.",
          "Wow the Tutankhamen exhibition is truly full of those wonderful things. Expect to spend a few hours enjoying the beautiful objects on show, many for the first time outside of Egypt.",
          "Tutankhamun exhibition was fabulous. Gallery staff are kind, friendly and helpful. However, not finding out that the exhibition was closing an hour early when I'd got tickets for the last timed entry was a pain as I had to rush!",
          "From the set timed entrance, to the friendly staff, to the most awe inspiring items I have ever seen - the Tutankhamen exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery is an absolute must. They have spared no expense in showing the finish Egyptian \u2026",
          "Update your working hours! I invited one of my guest from came abroad to the gallery. First, We've checked your working hours. On google it is said that Saatchi is open until 10 pm on Fridays. \nWhen we\u2019d arrived, it was 8 pm and the \u2026",
          "Went to see Tutankhamun Exhibition. I found it very interesting. Some of the exhibits were beautiful especially the jewellery. I found the audio guide very expensive. As far as I was concerned you had just as much information reading on the \u2026",
          "An amazing exhibition. I came with my 12 year old daughter who was mesmerized! My only slight niggle was that it was very hot in there! All in all fabulous thankyou",
          "Booked for 11.30am.  didn't get in until 11.50. Excellent exhibition really well displayed.  Info needs to be above display cabinets rather than below as too many people to be able to read them. But we did enjoy it.",
          "I went specifically for the Tutankhamen Exhibition. It costs about \u00a330 but is worth it. Despite the crowds I managed to see everything. Beautifully displayed, the grave goods if the young pharaoh are magnificent - as an English teacher my \u2026",
          "King Tut exhibition very busy, it's big already and takes time to see each exhibit, but takes too long because waiting for people to move out of the way. Long way to toilets. Cafe closed by the time we sped around. Best\npart was exhibit. Last chance.",
          "We visited the Saatchi Gallery to view the Tutankhamen Exhibition. \nFirstly the gallery itself is just 5-8 minute walk away from Sloan Square tube station. \nIf you come out of the tube station and look for the Hugo Boss store then walk past \u2026",
          "Its admirable the way this gallery operates especially with the huge historical significance of the Tutankhamun exhibition. \nEverything is perfectly organized and the actual event is a lifetime experience. \nMust visit!\nHighly recommended.",
          "Exhibition was good but very busy. However no one informed us it was shutting early on that date. Said on website it closed at 7.30 no mention of any special events. Ticket was for 4.30 to 5pm so shutting a 6pm meant we missed quite a bit \u2026",
          "Visited for the Tutankhamen exhibition and it eaz spectacular. For all the negative comments about it being crowded etc. etc. - don't forget, you are one of the people who are making it busy!! Obviously it's going to be like that, it \u2026",
          "We went to visit the Tutankhamen exhibition early February 2020. It was pretty amazing. They had a lot of items on exhibit and detailed commentary to go with it. Remember to go to the top floor! It's not part of the exhibition, but there's an amazing room with large sculptures.",
          "Went to the Saatchi to see the Tutankhamen expo. Interesting exhibits and gives you a flavour of what Carter and Caernarvon would have found. It was, however, very busy and thus it was difficult to see the exhibits. It paid to wait and let the crowds move on!",
          "King Tutankhamen exhibition, not as good as expected, all items on display quite small but still very fascinating",
          "We visited Saatchi for the Tutankhamun exhibition.  Great exhibition but they let too many people in at a time. I waited behind people to see any exhibit and was hit three times with backpacks (which with this density of people, should not be allowed in).",
          "A good location in Duke of York's Square, Kings Road, Chelsea. Just a short walk from Sloane Square and the Underground station, or take the No. 11 bus from Victoria Train Station.\n\nThe Tutankhamun Exhibition was crowded on a Sunday \u2026",
          "The exhibition of Tutankhamun is amazing.  Exhibits are incredible,  well presented,  brilliant lighting and spaced out making ease of viewing.  If an opportunity to visit this awesome exhibition arises then grab it with both hands. It's once in a lifetime opportunity to step back over 2,500 years of incredible history.",
          "A delightful gallery that\u2019s always worth visiting when in the area. They had a wonderful exhibition about Tutankhamen when I visited and they did an excellent job of showcasing the artefacts, trinkets and treasures and telling his story. \u2026",
          "Queue management is not a strong point - on arrival we were directed into a line to find that we were among people who had arrived an hour early. With limited numbers allowed in, it is no wonder that we had to wait almost 49 mins past our \u2026",
          "Came to the Gallery for the Tutankhamen exhibition and it was fantastic. Absolutely fascinating and very easy to follow for children as well. So many objects and well worth a visit",
          "Great little gallery, much bigger inside that anticipated. The exhibition for Tutankhamun was good. But having to bump into people with the session was a little annoying. Session starts and then the whole crowd moves through at their own pace. However you will find people pushing in front of you to see each of the exhibits.",
          "Brilliant exhibition.  So much to see and very good write ups to read.  150 artifacts to view.  Last time these will be seen outside Egypt.",
          "Absolutely brilliant! If you will not get a chance to go to the Cairo museum go to this exhibition. No the famous mask is not on display but the history and amazingly exhibits make up this a must. You are given specific time slots and there are a lot of people going round at anytime but for anyone interested in Egypt should go.",
          "Very busy at tutankhamun exhibition. No attempt to point out cloakroom so lots of people wearing medium backpacks getting in the way. Actual exhibition v interesting  atmospheric and beautiful jewellery. Content of shop very disappointing, \u2026",
          "The items in this exhibition are obviously amazing and once in a lifetime for most of us to see in one place. The experience itself is not the best I have been attended. Because it was so busy everybody is rushed through and I was genuinely \u2026",
          "The Saatchi gallery presented the stunning Tutankhamun exhibition, the last chance to see it before the artifacts go back to Cairo . \nThe exhibits were awesome in the true sense of the word. The history was on 2 levels,  first was the \u2026",
          "Visited the Tutahnkamun exhibition. Entrance protocol was strict but swift. Good level of written info so the audio guide is not necessary. The programme is way to pricey at \u00a315 and the information book is out of most people's.price range at \u00a340. Artifacts were excellent and well worth the \u00a326 entrance fee.",
          "The gallery is well located two minutes from Sloane square tube station. The staff are friendly and efficient and everything is well maintained.  The tutankhamun exhibition is spectacular.  It's more show biz than other exhibitions I've \u2026",
          "The King Tut exhibit was beautifully produced, but the number of artifacts was a little disappointing especially for tickets going for over \u00a325.\n\nThat said, the staggered entry system really did wonders. It wasn't so crowded that you were unable to observe the most popular items. Just wish there had been more.",
          "Wonderful exhibition,  well laid out and engaging. However, there were a lot of people allowed in at once. It is worth noting that the death mask used in the promotional material is not featured - but there is still an amazing selection of artifacts.",
          "An excellent place to visit. We visited the Tutankhamun exhibition late last year. Thoroughly enjoyable visit and a great part of Chelsea. Highly recommended",
          "Went to see the Tutankhamun exhibition and it was amazing! If you hate crowds more than u want to see a piece of history then stay away but for me, it was worth every bump from a stranger to see these exquisite pieces. We took our time in \u2026",
          "Saw Tutenkanham exhibition. Was great but lots of people .......took us 2.5 hours in all. The shop was expensive and they try to sell you photos against different backgrounds. Again expensive,  so we took our own. Virtual Reality to \u2026",
          "Lovely area,  very very busy to look around the tut exhibition. The queue was very long but we managed to jump queue to due to a wheelchair user.  There are 5 rooms to go in. Great exhibition but it is busy and not always easy to nice \u2026",
          "I recently went to see the Tutankhamun exhibition. The exhibition itself was incredible and definitely worth seeing. However the crowd management from the Saatchi Gallery was horrific. Through the first room in particular, you couldn't move \u2026",
          "The artifacts are amazing but the experience is spoiled by the crowds of people.  You need masses of patience while you wait to get a peep at the exhibits. Everyone wants to take photos too (me included) which holds things up more. It's \u2026",
          "Just visited the Tutankhamun exhibition. It's here until May 2020. There are items on display that are first time out of Egypt. The whole gallery is dedicated to this exhibition. It explains briefly the life story of the boy King, and how \u2026",
          "Saatchi gallery is a variable experience - depending on what's on. I visited the Tutankhamen exhibition which was beautiful but overpriced. The object were amazing but the curation was very pompous desperately trying to justify the entry \u2026",
          "Visited for the excellent Tutankhamun exhibition. Very well presented, but too many people are allowed in at each timed entry, so expect crowds. Nevertheless, a fascinating exhibition",
          "Once in a lifetime opportunity to view Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh, most of the precious objects never having left Egypt before. This is a beautifully-curated exhibition, telling the story of the surprise discovery of the \u2026",
          "The Tutankhamen exhibition is well-worth a visit. Takes about 2-2.5 hours. Recommend the audio guide so you don't have to read everything.",
          "Tutankhamun exhibition was brilliant, I think smaller numbers going through in the time slots would have been better as it was very crowded - unless we we're at a busy time! Plus when we wanted to get a drink and a sit time the cafe was \u2026",
          "A good exhibition space.  The exhibitions are usually well put together with just the right amount of information.",
          "Fabulous Tutenkhaum exhibition. Beautifully displayed and presented, great staff, very helpful and most polite. Highly recommended",
          "we attended the Tutankhamun exhibition here. They had sold far too many tickets for the size of the venue, it felt very claustrophobic. The artifacts on display were limited, and certainly felt like \"B List\" Items. The Virtual Reality add-on was quite good, me and my family enjoyed that bit.",
          "The building is a bit tired now, nearly every wall had black cloth drapes hiding what could have been nice but we couldn't see, the toilet area was adequate but with the amount of people it soon became congested especially as it was used as \u2026",
          "I went to see the Tutankhamun exhibition. It was amazing WOW! If you can afford the \u00a36 for the audio guide, I recommend you do. (We thought long and hard as \u00a312 for two is quite a chunk but turns out we could have shared but not easily). We \u2026",
          "Despite all the government advice, the ladies toilets had very little liquid soap and cold water for handwash. The sinks were awash with excess water and needed thorough wipe down. Went to ladies on arrival at 11 and on leaving at 1.30 and it was even worse then.",
          "Great Tutankahmun exhibition, well worth the visit, was in there for hours, genuinely fascinating. Shame it's the last time these artifacts will leave Egypt, however they are 3000 years old of course! Definitely worth the quite expensive \u2026",
          "King Tut exhibition. The \"photo op\" at the beginning is a complete waste of time unless you want a joke or prop photo, it has no images from the exhibition items - I could do the Photoshop myself and I'm definitely not a techy person, not \u2026",
          "Had a really good time at the exhibition. Timed entry is not really well organised as our ticket was 1pm but they allowed entry at 12:30 which I felt lead to high volumes of people trying to see the exhibits, having patience is a must. \u2026",
          "Visited the Tutankhamun exhibition, which was educational and captivating. I would recommend this gallery, it's a couple of minutes walk from Sloane Square. It was a fantastic experience visiting it.",
          "Visited the King Tut exhibition. So much to see, audio guides available if you prefer not to read so much. Last time the antiquities will be seen outside Egypt so take the opportunity!",
          "Visited the gallery to journey through the archeological findings of King Tut's tomb. The place is grand and has accommodated the exhibition in 5 of its many galleries. Really a remarkable place.",
          "Went to the King Tutankhamen exhibit and it was really good. Worth a visit. You had to turn up at a certain time slot. Groups were a little bigger than expected/desired.",
          "Excellent. It worth every penny. There is coffee - high quality coffee and ligh food. Staff to guide you  if you get lost. Very friendly staff, they know the job well.",
          "Went to see king Tuts artifacts. Had a fantastic time. You also can experience a virtual tour of the tomb. Only in London till May.",
          "A great exhibition.  Wonderful storytelling and a lot care and attention to detail. A must see before the exhibition is closed.",
          "The tutankhamun exhibition was packed. \nA lot of people were in a trance standing next to the  exhibits so it was very difficult and time consuming to get a good view. It was interesting but did not feature the death mask which is the main icon from the tomb.",
          "Went for the tutankhamun exhibition. We ended up going in earlier than our appointment\nIt wasn't busy and we were allowed to take our time to go around and have a good look and read. Everything was amazing. Did the VR at the end, was also \u2026",
          "Stunning exhibition of Tutankhamun,  though no sarcophagus. Loved the videos and commentary audio guide providing insights into the artefacts. Well worth a visit. The restaurant wasn't open and the cafe was a little disappointing as everything was paper cups, sandwiches in wrappers etc. we chose to eat elsewhere.",
          "Lovely gallery, interesting exhibitions! Location is also great :)",
          "Went to see the Tutankhamen Exhibition. Excellent exhibition. Beautiful items from him tomb with explanations of their purpose. Recommend.",
          "Great modern art gallery with a shop for art downstairs and great area for a walk around in the immediate area",
          "Stunning objects from the burial chamber of the King Tutankhamun. There was a long queue but the organization of the place managed to let us in as quick as possible. Be aware on some things, #1 if you go in winter, be prepared to be in the \u2026",
          "Beautiful gallery for both friends and family that will make a great day out! The staff were very friendly and knowledgable about Tutankhamun which is always useful when having a look around. It was reasonably priced for what we were given \u2026",
          "Visited gallery to view the Tutankhamen exhibition. Sensational exhibition and a beautiful well run gallery. We'll worth a visit.",
          "Tutankhamen exhibition was fantastic. Well presented and laid out. Busy, but not so much that you could not see everything by waiting a few moments for people to move on. Allow for a couple of hours at least, to get through all the galleries.",
          "Amazing Tutankhamun exhibition. Unfortunately there were too many people to enjoy totally. There should be a longer gap before the next group is admitted.",
          "Tutankhamun exhib was stunning. Layout and accessibility to items was first class and lighting excellent for viewing and photography. Final exhibit is well staged for maximum impact. A never to be repeated opportunity.",
          "Was awesome to see this Tutankhamun exhibition. Thanks Howard Carter for finding this incredible findings of history im 1922. \nLove it! 5 big fat stars!",
          "At the time of writing, Nov 2919, The Tutankhamun exhibition. Truly something amazing and soon to be seen only in it's new home in Gaza, near Cairo, in Egypt. Grab it while you can...or start booking a holiday in Egypt. (On until, I \u2026",
          "I've been down the Nile but missed Cairo. Great to see what came out  of the Valley of the Lings. Not crowded like the British  Museum..but then the BM is free",
          "Visited the Tutankhamun exhibition st the Saatchi Gallery in London  Amazing exhibits but would have been better if the way through it was more structured so that everyone could see everything. Would recommend going.",
          "First time here, I saw the Tutenkhamun exhibition. Very good gallery, exhibition was superb. Definitely go again when something else is on",
          "Enjoyed this but very busy even though we had tickets.  Still worth visiting but perhaps go later in the day.  Be prepared to queue outside in the rain and cold",
          "We went to the Tutankhamun exhibition, wow.  It is hard to imagine how people 3,000 years ago could produce such delicate and beautiful items with a fraction of the tools that we now have.  The exhibition was busy but the volume of visitors \u2026",
          "Always fulfilled with art. Modern, old, country, landscape....... For every taste, just see the coming events \ud83e\udd29",
          "Great Tutankhamen exhibition, they do need to time the tickets better so that fewer people are in each room at a time.  Fantastic otherwise.",
          "Brilliant tutankhamun exhibition. Glad I n the coach party got to see this. Well worth it. But very busy n expensive at end in shop",

          "An amazing experience but can be busy when trying to get decent photos, best to travel light if possible bags, coats etc are a nuisance when busy. The exhibition is well laid out but being in tall glass cases meant that you were going to \u2026",
          "Slightly disappointed with the tut exhibit as there weren't any wow items lots of small items. Should ban mobile phones too. Overly busy. Nice market outside.",
          "Beautiful place.. lovely environment.  Definitely  worth a visit",
          "Excellent exhibit however the lines to queue weren't  ideal. The layout of the tutankhamun was well organised and the displaying of the artifacts was well spaced. I think the museum is suited to individual exhibitions but not for a general gallery",
          "Enjoyed Tutankamun exhibition. Busy but plenty of time. Audio guide good",
          "Enjoyed my visit to Tutankhamun last week. Great layout and presentation! A shame that there were so many people but still managed to see everything I wanted.",
          "The  Tutankhamen exhibition was not as I expected. The death mask and sarcophagus are not part of the exhibition. Apart from a bed and a statue, there are none of the larger objects that one can see in Cairo. \nI recommend you bring corded headphones so that you can use the handheld audio device.",
          "Came for Tutankhamun exhibition, fantastic relics to see was lucky we came 18th March and with the virus starting was lucky enough to have gallery more or less to ourselves. Really enjoyed it.",

All of the staff were excellent and helped us on our way with a smile. I'll be recommending this exhibition to all my friends and colleagues. Definitely go if you can!",
          "Visited the Tutunkhamun exhibition. Took the recorded audio guide option which gives lots of background info. The exhibits are beautiful. It is quite busy so be prepared for a bit of a  shuffle around the various rooms, so relax, take it slow and enjoy \ud83d\ude01",
          "Tutankhamun exhibits superb. \nHowever Sacchi Gallery treating public like sardines. Horrific experience. We were crammed in so closely it looked like all they cared about was money.  Great place to catch the virus!! \n.",
          "Went to the Tutankhamun exhibition. Well layout and informative. The crowds are heavy and really it's difficult to get the best experience due to this. I mean I could understand everyone wants to see it before they go back to Egypt. I think \u2026",
          "I went to the StArt emerging Artists exhibition and I was absolutely enthralled.  I was there much longer than I expected and every moment was a discovery of a new piece of food for the soul by way of the most wonderful collection of art in \u2026",

          "Amazing exhibition of Tutankhamen\u2019s treasures. Was only a little disappointed by the fact you had to go from room to room, from dark spot lit places, through bright slightly shabby corridors, back into other rooms with other fabulous items. Just jarred a bit too much.",
          "Well organised and plenty of people to direct you if you are unsure of the way or have questions. Tutankhamun exhibition was amazing although I wasn't aware of the 3d experience until too late to get a ticket.",

          "Enjoyed the exhibition however a Tutankhamun exhibition isnt the same without the death mask and sarcophagus and other items i was expecting. Unless it was written some where that these weren't going to be displayed and i missed it i feel the exhibition is a bit miss leading.\nStill worth going to see it",

          "Visited the Tutankhamun exhibition here. Easy to find and get to. Short wait to get in, but worth it. Very busy with a wait to get close to the displays. Timed tickets every half hour, we spent a couple of hours here, but a lot of that was waiting to get close to the exhibits.",

          "First time here and what a way to start. The Tutankhamun Exhibition is magnificent.  I was not lucky enough to see previous exhibitions in London so felt I must do so now as this is billed as the last time the artefacts will leave Egypt.  This is a must see so I recommend everyone grabs the opportunity before it closes on May 2",
          "Tutenkhamun exhibition is here until next year, when these fascinating and priceless objects are in London together for the last time. Ever. Brilliant displays in darkened galleries, photos (no flash) are permitted. Plenty of explanation of \u2026",

          "The exhibition was fantastic but it has been massively oversold. Crowded galleries, hot as hell and everything overpriced for extras and gift shop. You just pay, pay and pay again even to check your coat  in the way in on top of the ticket fee.",
          "We went to the tutankhamun exhibition and it was wonderful. The building itself is well thought out and the queuing and entry was well planned and provided easy access. Would go again if an exhibition of interest was showing there.",
          "Expedition was absolutely amazing the way the exhibits were shown I thought was very poor .with to many people allowed in at once my time slot was 1130/1200 no way was this safe allowing people to take photos caused massive hold ups in the bottlenecks and dead end showcases  but the contents made it worthwhile",
          "Stunning building has various exhibitions on. We went to see the Tutankhamun exhibition and it was fantastic. Allowed to wander at your own pace and take photos. The staff were very friendly and helpful.",

          "Excellent exhibition, could've done with more seating to just take time to absorb everything.",
          "Very nice gallery with a caf\u00e9 downstairs. We visited the Tutankhamon Exhibition which is amazing. Lots of artifacts from the tomb. 3D virtual reality tomb visit is a very good experience.",
          "Went to the Saatchi Gallery to see the  Tutankhamun exhibition. The display lacked the iconic death mask but contained hundreds of beautifully crafted and fascinating pieces. Moving around the exhibition requires patience as it seems the \u2026",

          "A converted army building so a little convoluted with few windows. What's on will change my view : the current show Tutankhamen is a 5 star show, well explained, laid out, some exhibits you might miss in Cairo all excellent. Not cheap.",
          "Amazing , very good for children to explore the Egyptian history \nBit expensive, there should be good offer for tickets",
          "Tutenkamun exhibition was great, really enjoyed it, lovely gallery and later evening viewing was welcomed. The exhibition rooms were a little unbalanced exhibit wise, with the first being less engaging, and the last with just one large and \u2026",

          "Awesome gallery featuring tuntakamen! The facility itself was nice. Very spacious with a nice introductory video and ample space to see the exhibits. WiFi was also nicely covered throughout the whole building. Easy central location to get \u2026",
          "A splendid visit to the incredibly crowded Tutankhamun exhibition. My wife was wheelchair bound which was challenging, but the exhibition was brilliantly curated with the opportunity to read and learn about the exhibits from every angle and at every height, even when the actual exhibit was quite crowded.",
          "Really educational & was in 2 & half hrs & totally flew by.. didn't realise I'd been there that long.. so interesting & informative xxxx",
          "A great venue, there's an eatery on site if somewhat pricey. The Tutenhamun exhibition was well presented and excellent.",
          "Went tk visit yhe King Tut exhibition and it was superb. I saw it in the British Museum in 1972 and whilst it didn't have the same impact (no Death Mask!!) The exhibition was still tremendous, the naration and annotation were first class.",

          "I have to applaud the teams here on their support for people with disabilities. The entry teams spotted my walking stick as I came in the gate, and came straight over to guide me away from the queue (which was only maybe 20 people at that \u2026",
          "Interesting exhibition of Tutankhamen artefacts. Lift doors close too quickly when going in door started to close I now have s painful arm. I believe if someone starts to walk in door should have sensor so that it knows a person is entering",

          "Excellent Tutankhamun exhibition. Well organised & swift getting through security and into exhibition. Very busy, but beautifully curated. The exhibition shop a complete rip off, but the Saatchi Gallery can be forgiven - because you are allowed to take photographs!",

          "The gallery is in a great location and the entry process for the Tutenkamun exhibition was well managed. The exhibits looked amazing but it was just so busy in the rooms it really detracted from the experience. It was hard to get a chance \u2026",
          "Went to see the Tutankhamun exhibition, it was stunning absolutely amazing if you can go do so. It did get crowded I went in at 930 and allow more than the recommended 90 mins it took me almost 3hours to go round but we'll worth it",
          "We went to the King Tutankhamen exhibition which was highly disappointing.  The ticket prices are expensive and the exhibit space is packed with people. The few artefacts are good to see and are beautifully presented but there are just too \u2026",

          "A very well presented exhibition of rare artefacts (some on show outside Egypt for the first time), films, pictures and recreations. Despite having read books on Tutenkamun and seen documentaries, I still learnt new facts. The famous gold face mask remains in Cairo unfortunately.",
          "Visited to see the tutankhamun treasures, well displayed and amazing items. Would've been better if they spaced out the crowds. A little too busy",
          "Good overall, dirty furniture outside and the cafe was stark. \u00a32.50 for a cup of tea in a paper cup, go outside to the nearest restaurant and it's \u00a32  for loose leaf tea in a pot. I expected better at a Saatchi Gallery",
          "Tutankhamun exhibition was the purpose of the visit. Impressive. Organised and beautiful venue.  Lovely location",
          "Just an astonishing Tutankhamun exhibition. Interactive and well presented. An absolute must see. It\u2019s very busy though!",

          "They let too many people in at once. The audio device cost extra on an already very expensive exhibition. The lay out was terrible   meaning everyone crowded round the display cases then stopped to read the information which was on the \u2026",
          "Went to the Tutankhamun exhibition. Very good, but not excellent. Missing many of the big exhibits.",
          "It was an extremely interesting exhibition.  Well worth every penny of the ticket price. See it and learn a lot",
          "Went to the TUTANKHAMUN exhibition. It was well organised with friendly staff. Items well curated and set out. But it was very busy and a bit of a pain with the crowds round some items. But still recommend going to see the stunning items on show.",

          "What a wonderful day at the Tutankhamun Exhibition. Very well organised and staff very friendly. Well done.",

          "The Tutankhamun exhibition was well presented and managed. The in-house catering was reasonably priced and there was a good selection of sandwiches and other lunch food.",
          "Went to this gallery on the 31st Jan to see the Tutankhamun exhibition and would thoroughly recommend seeing this whilst it is in this country. Could be very tiring for young children and tickets are pricey. However if you do go, it is worth paying the extra for the Virtual Reality Experience as this was amazing.",
          "It's a bit of a rabbit Warren with no natural  light. We went for the Tutankhamen Exhibition which was stretched out over 8 or 9 galleries mainly do they could cram in as many people as possible and too many. It was difficult to get near \u2026",
          "Well organised exhibit. Plenty of guides. Restrooms clearly signed.",
          "Busy. A fraction of the artifacts there. Theatrical over informative.\nOooh.. an advert at the end to go to the museum in Cairo... hmmm",

          "Tutankhamun exhibition is impressive. All the exhibits are so perfect it's difficult to remember how old they are. Sadly no mask though. It's too fragile to move far.",
          "Saw the tutankhamun exhibition at 15:30 today. while the exhibit was very good with the artifacts really showing the Egyptian culture and history beautifully, we struggled with overcrowding, despite the staggered entry times. Too many \u2026",
          "Very nice exhibit, very detailed and good informative videos as you progress. Quite a few people sent it together so feels a little tight but still manageable to see everything if you take your time",
          "Great visit. Much see Tutankhamen tour before it leaves. Well laid out plenty to see and lots of interesting facts to read. For an extra fee the VR. Experience of the tomb is well worth it. The gallery also has a very good caf\u00e9 in the lower \u2026",
          "Beautiful building in a great location, however the staff were disorganised when it came to dealing with the crowds for the Tutenkarm exhibition. They were running late & too many people were crowded into the rooms at one time. Also the cloakroom charges were exorbitant.",
          "Was not clear where to stand or to go \nAt times the event holders were confused themselves!! Bought some items from the merchandise store online to collect, one man said top floor another said ground floor!!!\nThey sold too many tickets to \u2026",

          "Went to the Tutenkamen exhibition - fantastic - you should definitely make time to see this before it goes.",

          "I watched the Tutankhamun exhibition - it is awesome, please go if you can, I cant remember a better exhibition of Egyptology!! I am giving 4 rather than 5 stars mainly because the cost of entrance at \u00a340 is very steep. Still, worth it!",
          "Went to see the Tutankarmun exhibit it was excellent to see such fine old objects and learn about what the eyghtians believed in the after life.\nWell worth a visit.",
          "Visited to see the Tutankhamun exhibition.  The tour is well laid out and the exhibits are stunning.  Minor issue was navigating when leaving ... \nOtherwise friendly but thorough staff. \nEnjoyed it!",
          "Went here for the tutankhamen exhibit. It was alright, not much to write home about. You can probably see more online than you could at the museum as his death mask wasn't there. Unless you're a budding Egyptologist or enjoy museums, you might find it's crowded, narrow and busy.",
          "We absolutely loved the Saatchi Gallery,  we went to see the Tutankhamen exhibition and were completely blown away with it the exhibition was set out in 6 halls starting with his birth and ending with his legacy, it is amazing to see the \u2026",
          "The king tut exhibition was amazing and glad saw it. But the queues to see the artifacts, Alton Towers have less queues. It spolit the event. It was Saturday morning, but you have to select a time so the organisers know how many people can \u2026",
          "Enjoyed the King tut exhibition.  A long wait and queues for this popular event and unfortunately the famous mask wasn't in it. But there were others and plenty to see",
          "Fantastic exhibition with an amazing array of artefacts on display. Highly recommend, even though it's very busy.",
          "The exhibition I went to see was pretty good. However, the facility is not configured properly as a museum.\n\nThe museum is split into many rooms, but because most hallways seem to be open to the public, you are asked to show your ticket \u2026",
          "Tutankhamun exhibit was very good! Great space in a nice part of the city. \n\nCafe is reasonably priced too.",
          "Loved the gallery, learnt so much and was set out really nicely to be able to get round.",
          "Wandering around the exhibition gave me a chance to see the beautiful artifacts that were found in the tomb and l was very impressed.",
          "Went to Saatchi gallery for King Tutankhamen exhibition. Really good, a bit expensive to visit. Very busy, plenty of elbowing to see exhibits. Quite a lot to see, probably takes about 2 hours. Well worth seeing as outside of Egypt you won't get to see so much. Go see it!",
          "Was very interesting ans staff were helpful, but too many people in one go, do took a while to get to artefacts x",
          "A good exhibition of  some of the contents of tutankhamuns tomb most not seen out of Egypt. A bit crowded and chaotic so pick your times. Head sets a must, and the vr show although a little short was the highlight. There is one exhibit that \u2026",
          "The Tutankhamen exhibition was amazing, some of the artifacts were out of Egypt for the first time.",

          "We came here for the Tutankhamun exhibition in early March. We found the gallery quite exquisite on the outside.  Went on a weekday evening and there was no queue whatsoever. Maybe everyone was out panic-buying toilet tissue instead.\n\nThe \u2026",
          "Went to Tutenkamun exhibition. Was well laid out, but far, far too crowded with people taking multiple photos at each exhibit. Glad we went, but not a pleasant experience",
          "Way too busy. Everyone was pushing. Tutting. Humans are horrible. But 100s of people were being pumped into this event every half an hour. And Sunday was a quiet day apprantly. Dissapointed. Went to see the Tutankhamun which was fab. Consider this will you Saatchi",
          "Went to see the Tutankhamen exhibition at the Saatchi gallery.  Parked at Victoria Station about 10 minutes walk away.  Pre-booked the NCP car park and it was significantly cheaper.  The gallery is easy to walk around and has great disabled \u2026",

          "Visited today for the Tutankhamen exhibition. Was very impressed with the display and how it was laid out. Tickets where timed and we where in exactly on time. Once in you can explore at leisure",

          "Wonderful gallery, the tutankhamun exhibition was brilliant and the staff were polite and helpful.",
          "Really good gallery and display of information. The VR room is a must see if you come to visit to museum really informative and engaging. Cant wait for the next exhibition here so i can visit again",
          "Went to see the Tutankhanmun exhibition and it was great. Shame it was overly busy. Too many paying public in the gallery at the same time. I think too many tickets are sold  for each session for this timed entry event. Wish I could go back when it isn't so busy but I don't think that will happen.",
          "Went to see Tutankhamun exhibition.  The exhibits are amazing. But to crowded to really appreciate it properly.",
          "Was good, but expected more from the Tutankhamun gallery and we was told no access to canteen for persons in a disability chair.",
          "Excellent display of items from Tutankhamun collection but too many people admitted at once on timed tickets. Very difficult to read information boards. Virtually impossible to get a clear view / photograph.",
          "I went for the Tutankhamen exhibition and it was ok... Some very interesting pieces to look at and you can spend a couple of hours looking but some of there were some of the more interesting things missing. The gift shop was crazily overpriced",
          "Visited the Toutencarman exhibition here , very interesting.  If you go its well worth the extra to see the virtual reality experience this is excellent.",
          "Lots of decently cheap items can be had here. Although some items aren't really that cheap, so watch out.",

          "The exhibits were amazing and beautiful. BUT...too many people allowed in at a time and as a school group leader organisation for our party was inconsistent. No plans of exhibition to understand where you are in the building.",

          "Loved the idea I was able to have a chance to see Tutankhamun artifacts but was disappointed not too see his mask as all advertisements indicated it would be there.

          "Great exhibition but too many people to look at anything properly.  Also the video presentation at the beginning is great but difficult to see if the people in front are taller than you!  Maybe request taller people to stand at the back so us shorties can see!",
          "I've been to the Saatchi Gallery before but it was unrecognisable for the Tutankhamen exhibition. The exhibits were displayed in fantastic cases in appropriately decorated galleries and the videos accompanying the tour were very \u2026",
          "Great to see all the wonderful artifacts, Tutankhamun. Boyz enjoyed it immensely. I was disappointed NOT to see the original Deaths Head on this last showing, I last saw this as a young lad, it made a lasting impression on me back then, was \u2026",
          "Tutankhamen exhibition was incredible, so informative and enthralling. We used the head sets and loved it, spent a couple hours in here. Would recommend.",
          "This is once in a life time experience. A must see experience. Crowded but adequate space to see everything.  I would have liked to have seen the death mask but it was absent due to its fragility.",
          "Saw the Sweet Harmony show. Exciting to see rave culture honoured in this way. Great rooms and design. A limited amount of sources and focus on diversity left some aspects of the culture unseen.",
          "Tutankhamun exhibition was amazing.  But the gallery itself was a let down toilets smelly and tired looking and I have seen more palatial high st cafes.  BUT food was good coffees small and expensive",
          "Went for the Tutankhamun exhibition. Really enjoyed what was on show, especially being able to walk all the way around quite a few of the exhibits.",
          "I expected more given that it is Saatchi after all!\n\nFirst-time visit and to be honest I felt disappointed by 2 things:\n\n1. The exhibition itself seemed as if it could have been more creative. Given the subject matter (Tutankhamun) and \u2026",
          "Lots of smallish galleries. I went to the tutankhamun exhibition. I was s little disappointed, very crowded even on a Friday lunchtime, exhibits were well mounted an lots of information but so few of them and I was hoping to see more of the \u2026",

          "Tutankhamuns exhibition well worth a visit as it\u2019s soon to return to egypt.\nAmazing experiance to see the artefacts at close quarters.\nIt however was slightly spoiled by the amount of visitors let into the exhibition, as it made moving \u2026",
          "Visiting the Tutankhamun exhibition. Had a meal at the adjoining restaurant. Good care and a nice bloody Mary. \n\nThe Saatchi gallery is a great space and the staff here today we're excellent. I went with an elderly relative and they fast \u2026",

          "Absolutely marvellous! I took my class of 5\n30 10-year-olds to Tutankhamun's Treasures and they had the best time.",
          "I'm sure the gallery is nice enough but very dissapointed with the Tutankhamun exhibition. Paid through the nose for advance tickets only to be forced to queue in the rain and then crowd-shuffled through dark rooms to try to catch a glimpse \u2026",
          "Great exhibition venue, well organised. We loved it!",
          "Huge building, so huge you wonder if it weren't possible to squeeze in a few public housing units in there. The Tutankhamun exhibition was fetch, but OMG that shop at the end was criminally gaudy and tacky.",

          "The Saatchi gallery, has made a great job of displaying Tutankhamuns treasures, I've seen them in Egypt but they were more spread out. The gallery staff, sorted the queuing out really well. Some of the gifts were really expensive, but I don't think that was to do with them.",
          "Exhibition was amazing, well worth a visit queues to get in but moved swiftly slot of people but you can take your time looking at the artifacts never felt over crowded. Recommend a visit to this exhibition",
          "Attended the Tutankhamun Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh exhibition, it really is a must see. It's on until 3rd of May. Last chance to see the items before they return to Egypt.",
          "Good exhibit (Tutankhamen) but organisation of the gallery was awful. Booked tickets in advance and was given a time slot of 12pm-12.30pm to enter. We arrived at 12pm and were left to queue outside in the cold until we were finally let in \u2026",
          "I thought I was patient but evidently not after feeling like I wanted to snatch peoples mobile phones out of their hand and throw them across the room by gallery 2. Expensive tickets for an over crowded room which isn't set out well to \u2026",
          "Amazing exhibition, to be able to see such ancient relics at such close quarters was an honour and a privilege. The only down side was that so many other people also wanted to do the same and it was very hot.",
          "Went to see Tutankhamun exhibition very well presented and staff were very helpful. Good disabled access we were taken out of the queue and shown towards the wheelchair access point and then taken directly in the gallery staff couldn't have been more helpful.",
          "We'll run & efficient helpful staff. Stairs steep for less able bodied.",
          "First time there, I went to see the Tutankhamen exhibition. It was rather busy and was difficult to view everything as I felt uncomfortable staying too long at any of the displays, which were awesome. I was disappointed at the fact the \u2026",

          "Great Egyptian show, really loved the walk through. Higlyy recommend for any Egyptian fans.",
          "Visited the Tutenkhamun exhibition.  Lots of ancient artefacts to see and concise explanations. The display rooms were quite atmospheric.  On the downside it was very crowded in places so maybe not advisable if you are claustrophobic or not tolerant of rude, pushy people who only appear to be there to take close up photographs.",
          "The Tutankhamun exhibition is simply breath taking. Beautifully presented and with clear labelling. A total joy to visit.",
          "Went to the Tutankhamun exhibition and loved every minute of it. Informative and well designed.",

          "Fantastic Tutankhamen exhibition. Helpful staff.",
          "Visited the King Tut exhibition which was amazing in itself.  However, only one star as the management of the visit was appalling.   Online  tickets gave a specific time and we arrived 15 minutes early, as requested, to be held in a queue \u2026",
          "An amazing collection, very well laid out and lit. Well worth the visit. Only downside was people pushing to the front just to take photos.",
          "Visited to see King Tut exhibition - very well curated. Alternative is to wait for the new museum to open in Egypt. Highly recommended.",
          "Tomb displayed in the exhibition. So amazing to see these along with the photographs from when Carter discovered the tomb.",

          "It's a great place to visit an exhibition ( we went to the Tutankhamun exhibition) however I would not recommend as we did doing that on a tight schedule. We went on the coach and was told the tour would take between 60 and 90 minutes so \u2026",
          "Wow Tutankhamen exhibition was out this world. Great experience and nice family affair. Very good and very helpful staff",
          "Fabulous, must see exhibition of Ancient Egyptian artefacts and treasures",
          "Visited the Tutanhkam exhibition on Wednesday, too many people going through on timed tickets. Not what I expected, and no deathmask on show. Also the Cario museum allows no photography and people were using their mobile phones to take photos and it was not an enjoyiable experience. It was not worth the ticket price.",
          "Brilliantly abstract, wonderful concept art and a fantastic exhibition on global warming and the melting of the polar ice caps. Very thought provoking. The gallery itself is very well laid out, with plain white walls allowing for the art to \u2026",
          "Tutankhamun was excellent! VR tour is totally worth it, be prepared to wait. But do it.",

          "Was here for the Tutankhamun exhibit. Incredibly long queues even though we've pre booked tickets. Exhibit was okay, not all the artifacts were here from Egypt (I've been to the museum in Cairo). Floor layout was weird",

          "Went to Tutankhamen exhibition, bit commercial for me, additional charges for audio guide after \u00a327 entry fee, was better at the British Museum, 47 years ago!",
          "The exhibition is good but feel let down and disappointed. Saatchi expert advertisers your   poster is misleading as it shows the golden king yet the public don\u2019t get to see the golden casket or golden mask . The virtual tour at an \u2026",
          "Tutankhammon exhibition: Wonderful, but a bit too packed. And what Is the point of mentioning that filming and picture taking is not allowed if you can't enforce it? Most people did not see the expo but took pictures to see it later, I guess.",
          "Tutankhamun exhibition is 5 star....\nNot all the iconic artefacts but many never seen outside Egypt before.  Better to go a bit later; we went at 14.00 on  a  Friday and it was packed; no queues when we came out at 16.30ish.  Expensive, but cheaper than going to Egypt. Not great pictures by me, but sure their website is better.",
          "Tutankhamun exhibit is absolutely fabulous. Worth investing your time to visit it.",
          "Went to the Tutankhamun exhibition only so  very limited e erience of the whole gallery. Was very interesting. Was spread over several galleries so a bit fragmented. Staff a little brusque at times. Nice cafe",

          "I\u2019ve been several to see exhibitions there. The Tutankhamun one was fabulous. It\u2019s a lovely venue and easy to travel to by public transport. The park in front makes for a wonderful setting too.",

          "A wonderful exhibition at the Saatchi gallery. This is a very progressive gallery that normally shows really interesting modern art.",

          "Incredibly exhibition,  very lucky with the weather as qued outside for 35mins. Very crowded inside due to the popularity of the subject.  Cafe packed.  I went Sunday may be quieter during the week.  Really expensive,  everything had a high \u2026",

        "wiki": "Mammoth Lakes is a town in Mono County, California, the county's only incorporated community. It is located immediately to the east of Mammoth Mountain, at an elevation of 7,880 feet (2,400 m). As of the 2010 United States Census, the population was 8,234, reflecting a 16% increase from the 2000 Census.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Mono people were the first settlers of the Mammoth Lakes area, thousands of years ago. They settled in the valley but traveled by foot to other lands when trading with different tribes.The European history of Mammoth Lakes started in 1877, when four prospectors staked a claim on Mineral Hill, south of the current town, along Old Mammoth Road. In 1878, the Mammoth Mining Company was organized to mine Mineral Hill, which caused a gold rush. By the end of 1878, 1500 people settled in the mining camp called Mammoth City. By 1880, the company had shut down, and by 1888, the population declined to less than 10 people. By the early 1900s, the town of Mammoth was informally established near Mammoth Creek. The economics of the original town was based on logging and tourism. The first post office at Mammoth Lakes opened in 1923.In 2004, the Mammoth Ski Museum opened in town.  The museum featured many vintage artifacts, photographs, and posters.  A movie documenting the life of the founder of the ski resort (Dave McCoy) and those of early famous skiers in the area is shown.  In 2010, photographs taken by Dave McCoy were featured in an exhibit at the museum.\nIn 2008, after a jury trial, the Mono County Superior Court entered a $43 million judgment against the Town of Mammoth Lakes for breach of a development agreement.  The California Court of Appeal, Third District, affirmed the judgment in December 2010, and the California Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal on March 23, 2011. On Monday July 2, 2012, Mammoth Lakes filed for bankruptcy in the face of the judgement. Later the same year, the bankruptcy was dismissed as a result of a settlement between the town and their largest creditor.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 25.3 square miles (66 km2), of which 24.9 sq mi (64 km2) are land, and 0.4 sq mi (1.0 km2) (1.74%) water.\nMammoth Lakes lies on the edge of the Long Valley Caldera. The area around the town is geologically active, with hot springs and rhyolite domes that are less than 1000 years old.\nVisitors can take State Route 203 from the town of Mammoth Lakes to the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, over Minaret Summit, then down to Devils Postpile National Monument, with access to the Ansel Adams Wilderness.\nThe area has natural hot springs which are sometimes used after skiing. Other features include lakes, a soda springs, and an obsidian dome. Mammoth Lakes is north of the Owens Valley, a scenic area with extensive hiking opportunities.\nThe town is surrounded by mountains: on the west, Mammoth Mountain looms over the town, while to the south, the Sherwin Range dominates the view. This hilly terrain and the high altitude makes the area great for high-altitude athletic training, including among elite long-distance runners, who live and train in the thin air.The town is surrounded by acres of forest and is bordered by the Ansel Adams and John Muir Wilderness Areas. The eastern entrance of Yosemite National Park is located 32 miles (51 km) north of town. The town is situated in the southwestern, mountainous part of Mono County, California.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMammoth Lakes has a warm summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csb) or a rare dry-summer continental climate (Dsb) for the 0 \u00b0C isoterm, with long, very snowy winters, and warm, dry summers. Snowfall is particularly heavy from December through March, and averages 206 inches (5.23 m) per season. On average, there are 21 days of 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C)+ highs, twenty-one days of highs under 32 \u00b0F (0.0 \u00b0C) and 4.6 nights of sub-0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) lows annually.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Mammoth Lakes had a population of 8,234.

For example, Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort is the top ski destination in California. A 13% tax is added to the rental of any lodging facility and campgrounds for stays of less than a month. There are more than 4,599 rental units in Mammoth Lakes and the lodging industry generates around two-thirds of the gross revenue of the Town of Mammoth Lakes. As well as the pull from winter extreme sports, Mammoth Lakes also benefits greatly from tourism in the summer from people who visit to camp, hike and fish.\nThe Mammoth Lakes real estate market has gone through ups and downs over the past few decades. In 1980, an earthquake with magnitude of 6.1 on the Richter scale sent area property values plummeting on fears of a potential volcanic eruption similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. A significant real estate surplus formed after this, during which Mammoth Lakes had a total of over 1200 properties on the market. The development of the Mammoth Mountain ski area has had a direct effect on housing in more recent years. The tourist market has led to an explosion of property values. This peaked in 2003 when the median property value reached $750,000. Another peak occurred in 2006 with the sale of the Mammoth Mountain ski area to Starwood Capital Group.\nAs of February 2010, the median listing price was $460,000. This represents a drop of over 38% from the peak reached in 2006.Mammoth Lakes is home to Mammoth Brewing Company and Distant Brewing (previously known as Black Doubt Brewing Company.)\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe municipal government of Mammoth Lakes is of the council\u2013manager type. The town council consists of five members serving staggered four-year terms. A mayor and a mayor pro tem are selected from town council on an annually rotating basis.

          "Loved it so much, its amazing, go early cause parking and traffic are big in the winter .other then that, prices are hefty but worth it. Even if you dont ski or snowboard, they have good food, and lots of beer, bar right on the entrance. Bring sunscreen",
          "Good community and friendly people. Positive vibes with a sense of belonging",
          "Great mountain near Los Angeles",
          "Cool place for real. Teach your kids how to ski, because it's gonna be hard to learn in older age. I took few lessons - this is very attractive. Winter active sports are awesome. Bear Mountain is the place to try it out ;)",
          "Great atmosphere for beginners and experienced skiers and snowboarders",
          "Bear Mountain was closed on Feb 14 without notifying the people that had purchased tickets ahead of time. I was only able to get in contact with someone after waiting an hour on hold. Nobody was present at the resort and all the buildings were locked. I expected better from a ski resort.",
          "It\u2019s a dope flow style park run top to bottom. All the weekends are awful.",
          "Went to big bear on St Paddy's day. Conditions were much better than expected. Runs were well groomed and not too icy. Had a good bloody Mary and BBQ at lunch. Wasn't too crowded either.",
          "Great skiing pretty close to Los Angeles - you could do a day-trip if you pushed for it. Ideal for a weekend getaway (it does get very busy over weekends though)!\n\nThey've got two summits and in either one you'll have more than enough fun \u2026",
          "Pumpkin patch by Lion's club...lots of fun.",
          "Decent mountain resort with some good slopes, especially if you live in southern California. The resort itself is a bit run down, but they've been updating it in spots. Can get crowded during the busy winter period. Cafeteria has some decent food for not too outrageous a price, plus drinks.",
          "Best in SoCal for skiers and snowboarders.",
          "Great place to get away",
          "Pretty good skiing for 2 hours out of LA",
          "A lot of different slopes for any skill level without the challenges of significant hazards.",
          "I\u2019m in love with this place the resort is amazing the people who\u2019s been there knows what I mean.\nThe slope was incredible, unique, and perfect for going skiing or snowboarding. The food was great too. I highly recommend it.",
          "First time to Bear Mountain since late 80\"s and I was pleasantly surprised. Spring conditions were favorable and the staff was helpful in directing me to the part of the mountain I wanted ski. No lift lines on chair 4.",
          "Its a nice mountain to come down on. Many paths from the top to the bottom. This mountain is better to just chill and relax. You have some good views of the lake also.",
          "Great place to visit but, the hotels add on extra \"fees\" when you actually check in. They tried to charge an extra $190.00 to change rooms because our rooms weren't available even though we booked online. Bear and summit offer a \"military \u2026",
          "More features than what I\u2019m used to in Canada and they have longer seasons because they have more snow machines. I\u2019ve been coming here as long as I can remember and will keep coming because it\u2019s two and a half hours from the beach where I live and surf vs back in Canada where I can\u2019t do that",
          "Love this mountain. Always leaves you with something calling you back. Amazing park fun  honest staff Amazing conditions. Great jumps always evolving park I Love bear honestly idk what I would do without this park during the winter. This mountain truly has changed me .",
          "Awesome as always. I wish they had an intermediate slope somewhere in there though. The beginner slope feels like it's for absolute beginners and the path for the next level up weaves through black diamond levels so it gets pretty intimidating.",
          "Good options for beginning intermediate skiers",
          "Great place to go skiing and snowboarding go for it",
          "My daughter had a great time learning how to snowboard at Bear Mountain snowboard school. It was $220 for 6 hours that included drinks,  lunch,  lift ticket,  snowboard, boots and helmet rental. Get there by 815am to sign up. Class starts at 9. You can watch your child from the plaza area. Now my kid wants to go snowboarding again.",
          "Our family vacationed in big bear this year, and had to do the sky chair. Great staff, super helpful. The grill at the summit was good. Great energy here. We are coming back for lessons and take on the hill with mountain bikes when we return. Thank you for making a great vacation experience for our family. See you guys soon",
          "Great place to come to during the week for snowboarding. The lifts are empty and slopes are perfect. During the weekends it could get crowded and parking is hectic. But planning a trip is best during the week to get great parking and good \u2026",
          "Awesome place to spend the day snowboarding or skiing. The past years they have had plenty of real snow but they also make plenty of snow.",
          "Lots of time spent on these powdery hills!",
          "Went on Christmas day and it was a fun experience. I am an experienced boarder and my family never tried it before so for beginners it's a good mountain. The snow wasn't like Tahoe with a lot of fresh powder but the previous night it had \u2026",
          "Let me just start by saying that I don't ever write reviews.. But I had to. I came here with my 4 year old daughter and my dad for the day. My dad went skiing while my daughter and I hung out and enjoyed the snow and also the resort and its \u2026",
          "Love going here during snow!!!",
          "Great ski area.",
          "It's not a family ski \"resort\". Its a ski and snowboard ONLY lift and snow. They do not have a passenger scenic lift. It has the basic amenities and parking seemed easy enough plus the shuttle was fun! Snow summit is more of the family \u2026",
          "Everyone hates on Big Bear but I love it! Even with out natural snow, they blow enough man made to make it happen. Always fun even if conditions aren't ideal. Yes, of course Mammoth is amazing but Bear is closer to me and I always have a blast.",
          "Great local place to snowboard or ski. They have plenty of park terrain features a half pipe and some back country if you're into that. Parking can get horrible at times and their lifts are kinda dated they could definitely upgrade like mammoth or other nice resorts.",
          "Always fun.  I suggest premium parking on busy days.\n\nStop at Costco for same day lift passes if you're going with a friend and you'll pay about $65 per ticket (4x for $249).  Sell the rest or keep them for another day.  Its like BOGO on the weekends.",
          "Best to come during the week",
          "BEGINNERS CLASS: it is something you can teach yourself, very basic, and barely going ti help on the easiest trail.  \n\n2 hr long: 30 min to teach you about the gear and how to put it on, 30 min on how to walk and move around in snow \u2026",
          "Bear mountain is the spot to be for socal snowboarding or skiing. Epic park",
          "Awesome mountain. Would recommend snow summit if you want more runs, but bear has a little something for everyone regardless. Make sure you have chains or a 4WD car if trying to get up there after a storm - the last thing you want is to get stopped in the chain traffic. And leave early if you\u2019re coming from LA or farther!",
          "Good place to have fun",
          "Great place to kick back and relax hiking boating golf and good restaurants",
          "Great resort. Pretty good variety of terrain and solid snowmaking. Only complaints would be that some of the lifts are really slow and the park doesn't cater much to intermediate park skiers and riders. Advanced or beginner riders should have plenty of features to hit though.",
          "In my opinion, bear mountain is a better resort than snow summit in general. There were plenty of features that anyone from a beginner, to pro could take on and they were always kept nicely groomed. The only thing I dislike which comes with every resort is the overpriced food.",
          "It is always good, but I expected more snow since it was reported that they had a snow storm on Tuesday 3/12/19. Love big bear mountains! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude0d",
          "Still one of the best snow board park in California.   Good beginner, intermediate,  and export terrain.  There are 2 mid mountain lifts not crowded that go to the top.  Holiday weekends are insanely crowded on the roads.",
          "Fun local spot. The park lines are a lot of fun here! Not much other winter activities besides tubing though.",
          "Gorgeous snow, awesome features. Your full day pass will work at both bear mountain and snow summit, go to summit for beginner features, go to bear for harder slopes. Parking is free, sometimes they run shuttles between the two, but thats for busier days. It was definitely worth the extra drive to snowboard bear, the snow was beautiful",
          "Absolute trash. More like big bear mountain prison. The \u2018cafe\u2019 serves overpriced freezer burned food in a venue that is dirtier than a stable. Odds are you will be sitting on the putrid floor because there is maybe one chair for every \u2026",
          "The staff was all very friendly and helpful. The food was great, had a burger and some fries which were both very good. The mountain wasn't too crowded and had a great time snowboarding even though there are not a lot of lifts.",
          "Fun ski resort within 2.5 hours from San Diego. The best deals are when you can go with a group and get the lesson lift rental packages purchased in advance.",
          "I have tried many skis in my mountainous adventures life when I came across this place. I made a decision that turned my winter vacations into\na mesmerizing trip so we purchased our Snowboard Gear from winterwarehouse .Running down and \u2026",
          "Though it was my first time snowboarding, you can tell this park has trails for people of all skill levels. We came on a lucky weekend where there was winter storms and had the time of our lives. Fresh snow, cold beers, and a cabin that was \u2026",
          "This place is where freestyle snowboarding truly started- ive lived all over- bear mtn is like Disneyland... Jumps- Rails- so fun. Ive been riding there since it was called Goldmine lmao- taught me everything. 20 National Titles later- 20 years of travel- fun visiting bear mtn.",
          "Great place and friend employees",
          "One of the better ski resorts in SoCal, but still pretty small and overcrowded with snowboarders and terrain parks. If you're into that you'll love it. No hard runs whatsoever, even the double black diamond would be blues at other resorts.",
          "This was my first time skiing so we signed up for the classes. We got lucky and no one else signed up so it was like having a private lesson! I started off barely able to stand up but after the 2 hours session I was comfortable enough to go \u2026",
          "Good all around mountain. Small beginner runs and lots of long runs with challenging obstacles. I always have a good time when I go.\nBuy lift tickets 3 days early to save a little cash.",
          "a good place to play with children\ud83d\ude01",
          "Very good facility. Well maintained. Hope that the snow next season will be as good as this season...",
          "Great mountain, but they REALLY need to get their act together when it comes to parking, shuttles, and the lift operators. What a mess. \n\nWaited in line for the paid parking lot for almost an hour and a half only to be turned away because \u2026",
          "Great place to learn and to go on jumps and get sick air. Fun place in SoCal. Just go. Especially if it is a year with lots of snow. Go in March and ski in a T-shirt",
          "Awesome place to ski / snowboard",
          "We had an excellent time at big bear, we purchased the 3 day package online, the staff were very friendly and the whole process of renting the equipment went very smoothly and quickly. The only issue we encountered was one staff at the kids \u2026",
          "Disorganized lift lines & too many out of control riders.",
          "Bear is like a second home to me. It is where I learned how to snowboard, met so many great long time friends (employees and fellow riders) and have progressed myself on the park and mountain. The ikon pass has been a really great way to access mountains across the state and country. Highly suggest stopping by bear!",
          "Well organized for family of 6 - ages 4, 6, 7, 9 and adults. Lesson for 2 youngest, others did lifts and 2 different slopes. After lessons, family went on beginner slope so youngest got to ski with the family.",
          "Depending on which run you go on I hope you'll like the adventure. Between the steep hills and jumps this is the one I recommend for a great ride, weather you snowboard or ski it's the best one here in southern California.",
          "Great place to learn!",
          "First timer just go early due to the price",
          "We got our first snow boarding lessons here, instructor was great.  We lucked out and got fresh powder and small crowds.  Only issue was the chaotic ticket lines with staff on cell phone and lines stuck for long times.   It seemed to pay off to get there early for parking.  Overall a good experience, we hope to come back.",
          "1 * only because the Lyft tickets are way too expensive other than that I love it",
          "They have amazing slopes and fun jumps! Everyone there is also nice! Best place I've been in a while!",
          "It was a pleasure to finally visit this resort.",
          "They groom every night/morning as well as The Parks Staff are on top of their game with upkeep on ramps and landings not to mention their professional outstanding beautiful cheese wedge kickers.favorite place in the world for me. Especially my birthday free pass annual tradition.",
          "Simone at guest services was awesome! She was patient and eager to answer all of our many questions while purchasing 4 season passes! Great customer service!",
          "Little crowded but had fun",
          "Great \"local\" resort",
          "well organized and close location",
          "Very welcoming to newbies",
          "I wasn't a big fan, but that's due more to me than the mountain.  I'm a casual all mountain snowboarder visiting from PA.  I loved Snow Summit, but Bear seemed more geared towards Park riders.  I could see how this place is renowned for \u2026",
          "Great mountain for beginners to experts. Good freestyle park too. Lift tickets are also good at snow summit just down the road.",
          "Absolutely love riding here but the front parking situation sucks. I hate how both lots in front require you to pay $20 every day you go. It doesn\u2019t seem like much if your up there occasionally but if you go quite frequently it quickly adds \u2026",
          "Passes are WAY too expensive (used to be $50, now over $115 for a single day pass), parking unreasonable ($20), snow conditions rarely comfortable, rip off....total rip off. With gas, parking, lodge, ski lift, maybe rentals, you're looking \u2026",
          "Fun but hella expensive",
          "Wow, what a great 2 days! Plenty of snow, no problem parking and lots refreshments! Got my IKON, I'll be back!",

          "Fun place, I recommend first time skiers get the lesson. I didn't and regret it bc had a hard time stopping and getting up.",
          "Big Bear is a fun, but often very crowded resort. It is best to come here if you are a snowboarder that wants to do terrain parks. I would not recommend Bear for newer riders. Snow Summit next door is better for beginners. Parking is \u2026",
          "Great skiing!",

          "Big Bear mountains 30 miles away view",
          "Too many people on holidays and when it first opens. It's better to go when it's not packed. The drive down the mountain is crazy All the people that pull over and play in the snow ruin everything risking there life almost getting hit by \u2026",
          "This place is awesome!!! You can find cheaper rentals and ski lift tickets around town but the mountains are gorgeous and there are usually cool events going on. Not the best place for beginners unless you want to buy ski lessons but if you \u2026",
          "Great park but the main chair was closed for a while. But once it opened slopes were fine. Great resort.",
          "Bear obviously caters to all of Southern California. Need a little more ski patrol on the mountain. Good family resort...",
          "1st time and it was amazing",
          "Fun!!!\nIf you don't want all the Freestyle Obstacles in your way... Take lift 2 to 4 and stay to the right all the way down... Powder with no jumps or human obstacles that FAIL on the jumps... Lol",
          "Big Bear is always a blast and not quite as touristy as I remember.  Watch the altitude and keep your nose moist or you'll get a nose-bleed like it did!",
          "It was nice. Runs were very well kept. Disappointed that the lifts shut down at 1600, especially for how much you pay for lift tickets.",
          "This place is great on the weekdays, but gets a little crowded on major holidays.  HINT - book a stay close to the resort and go up on weekdays you will almost see zero lift lines.",
          "Good size resort it being SoCal. Lots of terrain for beginner to intermediate although I'd say that their advanced and \"expert\" runs are on the low end of challenging IMO. Still this is the go to place if you want to go ski nearby for a day or weekend.",
          "Had a great time. But it was a very crowded and busy weekend. With the traffic and the shuttles working full time it took hrs to get from our cabin rental for bear mountain only 3.5 miles away.",
          "Great resort.  Super friendly people great skiing. Well maintained slopes.  Loved it.",
          "Love this place.  Great for snowboarding close to home.... I live is San Diego.",
          "The beginner and intermediate runs here are great. I would recommend for people who are learning to go here.",
          "My first time snowboarding. $99/day/person. Parking was easy in the middle of the week before Xmas. Had one of the best bloody mary's by the bar at the end of the day. Great experience.",
          "Too many ppl today.",
          "The process to rent equipment is not difficult, but it is very chaotic. When you are going to rent the equipment, you also have the choice to get a ski lift. There is an academy to learn how to ski and snow board, but it's not open all day. \u2026",
          "Bear Mountain Ski Resort is a fun place to go when they actually have good snow. The snow fall for this resort is very little. During the winter months there is only really four or five really good days. The weekends up here are usually \u2026",
          "One of our best local resorts. However, if you haven't invested in a pass, which is worth it for us, you will pay through the roof. Ridiculous prices for a mountain that hasn't added apparent value. Plus, they have begun charging for \u2026",
          "Wonderful place!",
          "Fantastic snow paradise 3 hours from LA. White Christmas has always been happening.. family friendly, good slopes, great snow..",
          "Love Bear Mountain.  Not quite as busy and usually quick to get on the lifts. Trails are well groomed.",
          "Convenient mountains for quick day trips from San Diego and LA. Short runs, but they're fun with fresh snow!",
          "It's awesome, it is really smart to buy the season pass because once you come here once you will love it. The only bad thing is that there is not a safe way to leave your snowboard or ski.",
          "Can't be beat for convenience of location. Nice variety of trails for such a small ski area, but quite crowded, even in mediocre snow conditions. But we had some good fun!",
          "It was my first t ok me here and first time skiing. It was AWESOME! We obviously paid for the ski lessons so that we can be careful but have a good time as well. We had a great instructor by the name of Michael, he made me feel very \u2026",

          "Love this place...!",
          "Awesome trip but a little too crowded. The food and drink were good and the rentals are Burton",
          "Great snowboarding conditions. A few of the normal trails were closed but the main ones were open and they all had great snow coverage. Not too crowded possibly because of the Super Bowl but overall fun and enjoyable.",
          "This was the first place I ever went snowboarding at! Broke my tailbone, but the bloody Mary's and the cold weather killed the pain pretty quick. There's an awesome view at the top of the mountain",
          "I usually board at Mt. High or Snow Valley. I received a buy one get one from ski dazzle. 78 for a lift ticket. Kinda steep price. I got there a bit late due 2 chain conditions. So i was only able to board for 3 hours since this place \u2026",
          "Great experience!",
          "Fantastic well groomed slopes and great frendly and helpful staff. The other park goers were a bit rude and inconsiderate. Please be sure to be kind, clean and respectful if you dcide to visit this beautiful ski park.",

          "The resort itself is well equipped and the slopes are great but don't use your card if you can the workers will steal the information. I'm going through this problem now.",
          "Very expensive when bought at window. Won't allow beginners to use magic carpet unless signed up for class. So if you have first timers, beware. Otherwise snow conditions are good for southern CA.",
          "Super busy xmas to new year's so I'd recommend staying away. Make the trip to mammoth because at least their mountain is bigger. 1 day lift bought on site is up to $109, which is WAY too much for what you get at this \"resort.\" \n\nThey were \u2026",
          "Lots of things to do, everything at the mountain was super expensive as expected ski slopes had a lot of different routes and good trails for beginners",
          "Had a great day traffic couldn\u2019t get me down I was ready to hit the hill!! I got two runs in but as soon as I got to chair six this extremely rude woman would not except my pass! Modern snow jacket have a clear shield to keep passes safe \u2026",
          "Awesome! Lots of fun!",
          "Decent food, a little pricey but it's a resort so that is expected. The only part I didn't like was that they have the bunny hills closed off to the public, you can only go in if you pay for lessons. My husband was teaching me so it would \u2026",
          "For California snowboarding its good. The runs are limited for a resort, there's only a few of them, and it's definitely geared more toward snowboarding than skiing. But its awesome for a local ski trip. The instructors are really good, but I didn't like that they cut my lesson time short because of less people.",
          "My favorite resort in Socal! On the weekends it's by far too busy here though, I'd rather stay at home than fight to get on a ski lift for 30 min.",
          "Okay mountain. Small and overpriced compared to Northeast and Rockies. No challenging terrain on bear or snow for carving. Trick parks on bear we're good,",

          "My daughter and grandson had two beautiful days skiing and boarding.",
          "Probably a good mountain when not crowded. Traffic is ridiculous to actually get to the mountain. When we did get up it was so crowded people were running into each other nonstop. Save yourself the waste of time and drive to mammoth instead.",
          "Good slopes, snow and fun. It was a little bit chilly/nippy but non the less exciting",
          "Horrible service, no snow and road info ahead of the time.",
          "Great place if a little built for boards rather than skis. All staff were really friendly",
          "Recommend to arrive one hour prior to the class. Ski rentals are far away from the begginers track",
          "There might be about a million people there at a time but the mountain is big so you'll have enough space to yourself",
          "Very nice slopes with lots of fresh, powdery snow. Best to find a hotel close to the resort or else a lot of walking can be expected.",

          "Had a blast",
          "Great snow, great features ... but TOO CROWDED!  By 11AM, the lift lines were so long we just gave up and went home! Also, they always wait too long to open the half pipe. Give the half pipe higher priority!",
          "It's very smartly organized and the lessons are very helpful. The mountain trails are very long and very well pitched. The toughest trails almost have steep drop off feels. The intermediate trails give a good taste of steep and lesser \u2026",
          "Better than Snow Summit but still sucks compared to Baldy or Waterman",
          "Employees are pretty helpful with guiding newbies on what you need and where to avoid on the slopes. The rentals are pricey, but you get convenience of fairly simple returns. Lift prices are high if you're buying on the spot, but not too \u2026",

          "Despite the lack of snow y daughter and I had a good time. Luckily they make enough snow to still ski several of the slopes. I'd like the lift tickets to be a bit cheaper but all and all we had fun, staff was great, instructors were awesome. My daughter was all smiles which is all I cared about.",
          "Got into the lot before most of the employees! Still had to pay for parking once they showed up :( . Always a good time. Tried to leave an hour before the night sessions but still got caught in a mess of traffic going back down the hill.",
          "Great place for snow activities. The bad, the prices, they are to high in my opinion. Big Bear town is beautiful, you must visit this place.",
          "Great ski mountain. They do their best with what they have. Unfortunately not a lot of natural snow, but they are doing their best to make it. Foood and drinks are in abundance. Clean and we'll kept facilities.",

          "Always love this place. Always hate the drive back home from this place. It is what it is.",
          "Parking attendants were unhelpful, rude and impolite. It took us 6 hrs drive to Bear Mountain, due to road closures. We missed my son\u2019s lesson. We had 2hrs left of snowboarding. The lady at the window was polite to change his lesson the following day. No compensation for our lift tickets.",
          "bear mountain is the best place in socal to shred hands down!",
          "Good variety of park features and decent grooming. Park crew is out in the middle of the day to resalt and rake the features. Lines usually are not too long during the week. Weekends do get busy and there is sometimes more waiting than skiing on the busiest days",
          "Bear mountain is good for going to if you live in socal and don't want to drive to far. Don't expect great snow on the mountains because it is not uncommon for it to be man made. The last time I went (beginning of December) it still hadn't snowed in big bear and was all man made snow. Still fun!",
          "Ticket prices have skyrocketed. And now you have to pay twenty bucks to park. If you don't your car is a mile away and you have to climb onto an open air cattle truck and stand while hanging on. Stupid process. It used to be nice to go to the lodge and watch the skiers but you can't do that anymore.",
          "90mins from our house, great destination for a weekend, local town hav all you need, we're coming back during the summer for big bear lake.",
          "The resort is not a bad place. Very expensive for what you get though. I've been skiing for 17 years and injured myself for the first time ever here. A couple of the medics that helped me were wonderful but my review is based on the rest of \u2026",

          "The black diamond runs , when open, are like a blue/black on Mammoth but they are fun to ride on. Oddly, this past Monday was a holiday and there was not a lot of people on the mountain. Was able to park in the lot right next to the resort instead of the lower lot.",
          "So much fun! I recommend before you go to get your gear somewhere else if your renting if not then. All you have to worry about is your ride ticket. Over all fun friendly place. But there is a lot of 420 people there. Recommend if you have teenage kids to be aware.",
          "This resort had great snow making machines and the snow was really smooth. Employees were nice and helpful with lifts. Rental employees were nice as well. Although it can be pricy at some parts of the day such as food and buying extra accessories.",
          "Friendly and helpful staff.  Very organized set-up for visitors.",
          "Great place for skiing and snowboarding. They have a good mix of slopes that can accommodate advanced to novice and even the handicapped.\n\nFor food options they have traditional American lunch type food such as burgers, tenders, soups, etc. \u2026",

          "First time here, great ski resort! Just don\u2019t go during long weekends, it can get really crowded!",
          "I really do love this place, having grown up in San Diego. Not the biggest mountain and the snow usually isnt great, and yet its such a fun place to go. The park is always great and the groomers are groomers, ya know?",
          "Had a great time, didn't black diamond but I did black out!",
          "On Jan 14th I went snowboarding at Bear Mountain. Normally I go to Mammoth, or Snow Summit when I\u2019m in Big Bear but thought let\u2019s give Bear a try this year with my awesome ikon pass. Well let\u2019s say it will be my last time riding this \u2026",
          "Not a bad place to people who love to ski and skateboarding..price for equipment rental and fees are kind of high and place is packed and crowded in seasonal.",
          "Great skiing, but for the high priced tickets, maybe you could remember some customer appreciation techniques and make the food reasonably priced so people are able to eat and stay here longer, thus giving them more time to enjoy the slopes \u2026",
          "I love this place. When I first came here I was not sure what to expect. However, the 65 degree snowboarding sesh was an experience I will never forget. If you are feeling adventurous like I was, give this place a try!",
          "Went up snowboarding at bear and as usual a great time. Great job blowing snow for the weather that we've had. Good to know there's gonna be open trails and good times awaiting right in the San Bernardino mountains regardless of the annual snow fall",
          "Totally wasn't here to ski but to run an adventure race.  Resort was set up well with excellent outdoor food.  Totally worth it to come up during the summer months and marvel at what is under the snow during the winter.",
          "If your wild and crazy this is your Mountion it has boxes, rails, jumps, and so much more if your going on a family tip I recommend snow summit.",
          "Very crowded. The \"snow\" is as hard as concrete. Not their fault because this is So Cal, but it makes for some nasty falls if you're not used to icy conditions. The atmosphere is awesome. Concerts and DJ's and lots of entertainment. Overall it's the best So Cal can offer in regards to \"winter\" activities.",
          "Mostly it is artificial snow (we visited last in mid-March), but it seems plenty of it. There is a good variety of slopes and runs, both for ski and board - certainly for a place 2h drive from downtown L.A. \nApres ski is limited, but the \u2026",

          "Mainly for snowboarders. Has some, nice long beginner runs for both skiers and snowboarders.",
          "Ok, it definitely better than the other ski resorts with a couple of hours, no doubt about that. There are a few runs that are ok when the snow is good, Geronimo for example. But of all the ski resorts I have visited in the US and Canada, \u2026",

          "Let's shred!! I enjoy Bear, but have never been anywhere else to compare it. Always fun though!!",
          "So much fun,  but man it just gets more and more expensive while not getting any less crowded.   At the very least they could knock down the beer prices a little to keep everyone happy",
          "good place but kinda crowded and they need to learn to group riders onto the lift. Lots of single and two rider on a quad, makes for unnecessarily longer lines, get w the program folks",
          "A little overpriced, but the snow they had Presidents Weekend was awesome. Plus the 18 was shut down so a long drive up the backside was no bueno.",
          "Awful ice.. not snow.  yes I shouldn't really blame the resort cuz there was no snow anywhere else but I thought it would be a little nicer than that",
          "Really good ski resort but when weekend it will be parking hell",
          "For the first time ever got stuck on the lift for 40 minutes.  It was getting quite cold. I got a baucher for $10.00 that cannot be used for anything really. Only could be used on rentals and lessons. Not even to partially pay for a wax \u2026",
          "Staff is terrible, showboarding is great but staff needs to chill out , take passes away from random, even if your a new snowboarder. Best to stick with mountain high",
          "Long lines for a friday only because they let singles and doubles ride alone on a quad on 80% of chairs.  No singles line or people grouping up riders.  Snow still icy and few good medium jumps...only tiny and huge jumps.  The scanner \u2026",
          "Rented a cabin right next to the resort was awsome had a great view and the skiing experience was fun for the family",

          "Decent snow but it's normally pretty crowded.",
          "This is a great resort 10 out of 10 unless you ski. This resort has a lot of snowboarders and it feels more snowboard oriented. Its is still great for skiing but even better for snowboarding.",
          "Great instructors",
          "\"Come for FREE on your birthday :,)\"",
          "Best park in SoCal. So super crowded though on the weekends. Traffic's gotten worse over the past ten years as well. We waited in the overflow lot for over an hour before we got a shuttle ride up (on a Sunday morning). Totally should have walked the mile up, it would have been faster--but we didn't know that when we got in the line.",
          "Beautiful slopes--especially for snow boarders. Hint: Stay at Comstock Condos. They have secure parking that goes with your stay as well as private ski in ski out access to the slopes. Best kept secret!",

          "Always a blast! Make sure to check out both resorts via the white shuttle bus. I do especially like how they added additional off-site parking. Makes for less crowds trying to leave all at once",
          "Great snow.  Good friendly people work there",
          "Close with fair grooming and lift services. Group lessons are not worth it here, lift line staff leaves the place feeling unorganized as you fight for your place in the queue. Overall a good close place to go for a weekend especially if you enjoy terrain park elements, just don't expect top quality service.",
          "Great place to ski but the lift tickets are extremely expensive.\n better get him to Costco in a four pack $250",
          "Nice resort for skiing. It had a lot of snow as well as the capability to make its own snow. Most of the lifts were open and the majority were quick quad lifts.  They have some runs with man made obstacles like half pipe, jumps, and rails. \u2026",

          "Attended the Triumph Foundation's annual adaptive snow skiing event, hosted by USARC (United States Adaptive Recreation Center) located at Bear Mountain. Outstanding day! Great staff and volunteers. Excellent equipment and gear. Good food. Decent conditions and prices. Best local skiing in SoCal.",

          "Awesome hills",
          "Decent ski mountain, 8 lifts, 3 peaks, hard packed, other skiers can be dangerous and reckless here.",
          "Bear mountain is a fun place to snowboard, but I've had issues with management a couple of times and I think that because they're the biggest resort in So Cal they don't feel any compulsion to please their customers. We pretty much have nowhere else to go, and they know that.",

          "Bear can be crowded at times and the traffic down the mountain is always bad. Try taking the other roads down, it's well worth saving the time in traffic. You may need chains if it had just snowed but bear is usually hot during the day and \u2026",

It can get a little loud but it's not bad. The staff is pretty friendly for the most part although there were a few that were super unhelpful. They need beret refund policy too.",
          "When snow conditions are good this place is great.",

          "Visited during off-season but the resort was charging peak-season/holiday prices. Limited amount of runs charged at full prices. Snow was man-made and a bit underwhelming due to the park staff not wanting to groom any of the park features. \u2026",

          "If you are into snow boarding or skiing, you should check this place.  You can rent your equipment, learn how to ski or snowboard or buy passes.  During summer you can take the lift, appreciate the view of Mt. Gorgonio and hike or bike going down. A good way to enjoy the mountain whether during winter or summer time.",

Nature has been neglecting our slow for some years, but when they get it then you better get there. My one gripe is they havent yet updated the gate with scanners like other resorts. See you on the slopes!",

          "Amazing place - simply breathtaking up atop the mountains. For what you are paying, it is worth it. You may choose to rent equipment. This is a place for advanced snowboarders or skiiers, and beginners.",

          "In Southern California, it is difficult to find better skiing/snowboarding options. I think the only two things that really get to me about Bear Mountain are: 1) generally high prices, and 2) crowds. Especially when it comes to holiday \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Volkswagen Amarok is a pickup truck produced by Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles since 2010. It is a traditional body-on-frame truck with double-wishbone suspension at the front and leaf springs at the rear. The Amarok range consists of single cab and double cab, combined with either rear-wheel drive or 4motion four-wheel-drive, and is powered by turbocharged gasoline or turbocharged direct injection (TDI) diesel engines. Volkswagen considers the Toyota Hilux, Nissan Navara, Mitsubishi L200, Ford Ranger, Isuzu D-Max and Chevrolet/Holden Colorado/S-10 to be Amarok competitors.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2005, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles announced their intent to build a robust pickup and off-road family of vehicles.In 2007, automotive website WorldCarFans.com published the first photos captured by RoAnSa Carspy Photography of the development mule of the Robust Pick-Up concept vehicle wearing Toyota Hilux sheetmetal on a Volkswagen-developed chassis.\n\nIn March 2008, automotive spy photographer Hans Lehmann captured the first image of the Robust Pick-Up wearing a production body which was designed by Walter de Silva.In September 2008, Volkswagen released the Robust Pick-Up concept in a search and rescue (SAR) vehicle color scheme; the design was said to be 95% a production version.The Amarok, the first pickup from Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, was presented to the general public in General Pacheco, Argentina, on 7 January 2010.\nFollowing the launch in Argentina, the Amarok was a key support vehicle in the 2010 Dakar Rally, with 45 having been used.In November 2010, the Amarok was awarded 4 stars from Euro NCAP under the 2010/2011 standard crash testing procedure. In February 2011, it received 5 stars from the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP).\n\n\n=== Naming ===\nThe name 'Amarok' was developed and researched by branding agency Interbrand on request from Volkswagen.Revealed to the public on 4 June 2009, Amarok means \"wolf\" in Inuit languages, and Interbrand also claims it is associated with \"he loves stones\" in Romance languages. It also resembles \"tomorrow\" in Irish. It is also the title of a 1990 record album by musician Mike Oldfield, a 2000 album of the German black metal solo project Nargaroth, and the name of an open-source music player.\nVolkswagen's association with 'Wolf' is referenced on many of its vehicles. Up until the 1980s, the 'Wolfsburg Crest', in various guises, was displayed on VW products, the most famous being the Type 1. Until 1964, the Wolfsburg crest badge was placed on the bonnet. The crest also appeared on the steering wheel hubs on many models. The Lupo (Italian for Wolf) was named in honour of Wolfsburg, the home of Volkswagen.\n\n\n== Engines ==\nThe Amarok is powered by a range of turbocharged direct injection (TDI) common rail diesel engines, and fuel stratified injection (FSI) petrol engine.As of 2010, the engine range consists of two 2.0L turbocharged direct injection (TDI) common rail diesel engines which is taken from the Volkswagen Transporter (T5), it has been tuned for more torque but less power; the entry-level version produces 90 kW (122 PS; 121 hp) which develops a maximum torque of 340 N\u22c5m (250 lb\u22c5ft) from 2,000 rpm. The top-of-the-line bi-turbo version produces 120 kW (163 PS; 161 hp) which develops a maximum torque of 400 N\u22c5m (300 lb\u22c5ft) from 1500 rpm \u22122500 rpm. Fuel consumption in a combined cycle format is as low as 7.6 L/100 km (37 mpg\u2011imp; 31 mpg\u2011US) on the rear-wheel-drive variant to 8.1 L/100 km (35 mpg\u2011imp; 29 mpg\u2011US) on the 4Motion version, which theoretically gives the Amarok a 1,000 km (620 mi) range before filling up for fuel.\nAs of the 2012 Model Year, Volkswagen has introduced two more engine configurations, 2.0L TDI 90 kW motor upgraded to 103 kW of power and a 2.0L Bi-TDI which has an optional 8-speed ZF engineered automatic transmission.On 22 September 2014, Volkswagen launched a limited edition Amarok Dark Label model. The Dark Label model is fitted with the 178 bhp (180 PS; 133 kW) 2.0-litre BiTDI engine, generating up to 420 N\u22c5m (310 lb\u22c5ft) of torque and offering a maximum towing capacity of up to 3,200 kg (7,100 lb).For the 2017 model year, Volkswagen announced a facelifted Amarok range. The key feature of the facelift is a new engine that replaces the earlier models' 2.0L TDI engine. In place of the previous four-cylinder engine, the Amarok is now fitted with a version of VW's 3.0L TDI V6. It will be available in three states of tune (121 kW (162 hp), 150 kW (201 hp), and 167 kW (224 hp)), with the most powerful version boasting a torque output of 406 lb\u22c5ft (550 N\u22c5m) and a 0\u201362 mph (100 km/h) time of 8 seconds. In the UK the lowest power output was dropped in favour of the 201 and 254 BHP models, the latter has an overboost to 268 and can hit 62 from a standstill in 7.4 seconds.The new V6 TDI offers up to 23% more power and 28% more torque while delivering lower emissions and decreased fuel consumption compared to the previous 2.0 BiTDI engine that was previously the most powerful option. Deliveries of the new Amarok V6 TDI were scheduled to commence in the 3rd quarter of 2016. In late 2018 a more powerful version of the 3.0 V6 TDI was produced (190/200 kW & 580nM) to compete with the new Mercedes Benz X Class V6 TDI.\n\n\n=== Engines ===\n\n\n=== Driveline ===\nThe Amarok has three drive concepts: rear wheel drive, Shiftable 4Motion and Permanent 4Motion.\nThe Shiftable all wheel drive system can shift drive between the axles whereas the Permanent full-time all wheel drive system distributes power through a Torque Sensing (Torsen) differential with a 40:60 ratio between the front and rear axles.\n\n\n== Production sites and figures ==\nThe Amarok is currently being produced in the Volkswagen Group plant in General Pacheco, Argentina; for South American, Mexican, Oceanian, South African, Russian, and European markets.It is expected to produce 90,000 Amaroks annually once production is at full capacity.The Hanover site was originally dropped from possible sites to produce the Amarok due to the Global Financial Crisis and increasing economic costs in Europe in 2009.In September 2010 it was decided by the Volkswagen Group Board of Management that 40,000 Amarok pickups will also be built in Hanover, Germany for the European and small volume markets from the middle of 2012.The 100,000th Amarok was produced on 8 October 2011.Production Figures:\n\n2009 = 193\n2010 = 44,525\n2011 = 25,518 (until May 2011)\n\n\n== Availability ==\nCurrently the Amarok is available in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, Paraguay, Mexico, Mongolia, New Zealand, South Africa, and throughout Europe and South America. VW met with Canadian and American dealerships in 2012 to talk about introducing the pickup to those markets. At least for the U.S., this would likely necessitate moving production or building a plant somewhere in North America, to avoid the Chicken tax, which was enacted in part to target sales of the Volkswagen Type 2 panel van and pickup. On 1 January 2018, Volkswagen registered the Amarok name in the United States, signaling its intention to bring the pickup to America in the near future.\n\n\n== Model lines ==\nThree equipment lines will be offered on the Amarok; base version, Trendline and Highline.\n\n\n=== Base version ===\nThe base version comes equipped with 16-inch steel wheels, height-adjustable front seats, variable folding rear bench seats, locking glove box, cargo platform lighting, antenna integrated within wing mirrors, manual window regulators, manual door locking and manual wing mirror adjustment.\nThe front bumper, wing mirrors and door handles come in black.\n\n\n=== Trendline ===\nThe Trendline grade has over the base version electrically operated door locking, electric windows and wing mirror adjustment as well as a radio with a CD player, climate control (Climatic), multi-functional display, cruise control, front fog lights, 17-inch aluminium wheels.\nAlso painted in the body colour are the front bumper, door handles and wing mirrors.\n\n\n=== Highline ===\n\nThe Highline grade has over the Trendline part chrome mirror housings, chrome strips on radiator grille and around the fog lights, chrome rear bumper bar 18-inch aluminium wheels, automatic climate control (Climatronic), leatherette/leather fabric on the interior.\n\n\n== Platform variants ==\n\nThe Amarok was launched in a Double Cab variant with the Single Cab first launching in late 2011 in South Africa and Europe\n\n\n=== Other variants ===\nXL +31 CM\nXXLOffers an extended bed with 2.21 m (7 ft 3 in) of space and a slightly longer wheelbase.\n\nChassis cabIn 2006 the Australian publication Transport Today reported that Phil Clark, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles Director in Australia, was trying to persuade Volkswagen's head office to add a chassis cab programme to Project RPU.Cab Chassis variants of both the Single Cab and Double Cab will launch with the 2012 Model Year range.\nAmarok Sochi Special EditionThe official vehicle of the 2014 Winter Olympics, the Amarok Sochi Special Edition was available only in Russia. It adds extra exterior chrome trim, a navigation system and an updated interior.\nAmarok Polar ExpeditionThe Polar Expedition variant was designed to promote the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games in the remote areas of Russia.\nThree of these trucks were built to carry nine people 9,942 mi (16,000 km) east by road from Moscow to the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on the Kamchatka peninsula. The team of 9 earned the Guinness World Record for the longest off-road journey through one country. The team took 66 days to reach Kamchatka from Moscow by driving over the glacier-covered Sredinny Range and were the first people to do so. The specially built Amaroks received a couple of upgrades to take on the cold and road less wilderness. The team replaced the front and rear suspension with long-travel, heavy-duty shocks and massive tires with deeper ridges for extra traction in deep snow and ice. The body was unmodified except for cutting out the fenders to fit the wheels and tires. The 2.0L turbo diesel engine remained mostly unmodified because the goal was reliability. For added safety, the interior was fitted with a roll cage and navigation equipment to make sure the team didn't get lost.\nSpin-offsRumoured platform spin-offs include a five to seven seat SUV to compete with Nissan Xterra and Toyota Hilux SW4 to be built in Brazil for the South American and European markets.The Dutch Ministry of Defence has announced plans to phase out other vehicles, including the Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen, in favour of the Amarok to move to a single type of truck for peacetime operations. The stated aims for this plan are to purchase 1,667 new vehicles for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marechaussee.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nAuto Esporte \u2013 Pickup of the Year 2011 (Brazil)\nSafest Pickup 2011\nAuto Test \u2013 Cruze, One and Amarok, the best of the year according to Auto Test (Argentina)\nParabrisas \u2013 Pickup of the Year 2011 (Argentina)\nMotorTransport \u2013 International Pickup Truck of the Year (UK)\nOFF ROAD \u2013 Pickup of the Year 2011 (Germany)\nMagazin J\u00e4ger \u2013 Goldenen Keiler (Golden Boar) Best Hunting Car (Germany)\nROAD \u2013 Russian Automobile Dealers Golden Klaxon \u2013 Special Vehicles Class (Russia)\nWhat Van? \u2013 Pickup of the Year 2012 (UK)\n4X4 Australia \u2013 Ute of the Year 2011 (Australia)\nDelivery \u2013 Ute of the Year 2011 (Australia)\nZoo Magazine \u2013 Manliest Motor of the Year 2011 (UK)\nBritish Insurance Vehicle Security Awards \u2013 Best Pickup of the Year 2011 (UK)\nMotoring.com.au 2017 Dual-Cab Ute Comparison Winner\nStuff Motoring New Zealand Top Pick-up of 2017\nTow Car Awards 1,900 kg+ & Best Pick-up Winner 2018\nInternational Ute of the Year 2018\n\n\n== Search and Rescue Pickup concept ==\nVolkswagen revealed their one tonne pickup study at the 2008 IAA Commercial Vehicle Show in September; the SAR Pickup measures 5.18 m (17 ft) in length and 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in) in width, and the 1.55 m (5 ft 1 in) long cargo bed can carry a Euro sized broad pallet sideways.\nSAR Pickup concept also was equipped for Lifeguards with: four mobile CB radios, flashlights, first aid kit with a defibrillator, binoculars, two safety helmets, removable neoprene seats for hard wearing, and a blue light roof module with integrated searchlight.\nPossible production features that were on the concept: radio navigation system controlled by a multifunction touch screen, differential locks, cable winch and the rear logo opens the tailgate.2008 SAR Concept Pickup at the 2009 Melbourne International Motor Show:\n\n\n== See also ==\nFiat Fullback\nChevrolet Silverado\nFord Ranger\nToyota Hilux\nNissan Navara\nMitsubishi Triton\nGreat Wall Wingle\nUAZ Patriot\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmarok \u2013 Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles US\nAmarok \u2013 Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles UK\nAmarok Double Cab \u2013 Volkswagen South Africa",

        "wiki": "Systematic doping in Russian sports has resulted in 47 Olympic and tens of world championships medals being stripped from Russian athletes\u2014the most of any country, more than four times the number of the runner-up, and more than 30% of the global total. Russia also have the most athletes that were caught doping at the Olympic Games, with more than 200.Russian doping is distinct from doping in other countries because of the fact that in Russia steroids and other drugs were supplied to athletes by the state. Due to widespread doping violations, including an attempt to sabotage ongoing investigations by the manipulation of computer data, in 2019 the World Anti-Doping Agency banned Russia from all major sporting events for four years.\n\n\n== Background: Soviet era ==\n\nAccording to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\". On the topic of the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists' Games.\"Documents obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympics boycott, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements. The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n=== Doping issues from 2008 to 2009 ===\nIn 2008, seven Russian track and field athletes were suspended ahead of the Summer Olympics in Beijing for manipulating their urine samples.Multiple Russian biathletes were involved in doping offences in run-up to the 2010 Olympics. The president of the International Biathlon Union, Anders Besseberg, said, \"We are facing systematic doping on a large scale in one of the strongest teams of the world.\"Reviewing 7289 blood samples from 2737 athletes from 2001 to 2009, a report found that the number of suspicious samples from \"Country A\" notably exceeded other countries. One of the authors said that Country A was Russia.In October 2009, IAAF general secretary Pierre Weiss wrote to Valentin Balakhnichev that blood samples from Russian athletes \"recorded some of the highest values ever seen since the IAAF started testing\" and that tests from the 2009 World Championships \"strongly suggest a systematic abuse of blood doping or EPO-related products\".\n\n\n=== 2010\u20132014: allegations of state-sponsored doping and 2014 ARD documentary ===\n\nIn 2010, an employee at the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), Vitaly Stepanov, began sending information to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) alleging that RUSADA was enabling systemic doping in athletics. He said that he sent two hundred emails and fifty letters over the course of three years. In December 2012, Darya Pishchalnikova sent an email to WADA containing details of an alleged state-run doping program in Russia. According to The New York Times, the email reached three top WADA officials but the agency decided not to open an inquiry but instead forwarded her email to Russian sports officials. In April 2013, having failed a doping test for the second time (after a previous two-year doping ban in 2008\u20132010), Pishchalnikova was banned by the Russian Athletics Federation (RusAF) for ten years, in a move that was likely in retaliation. Her results from May 2012 were annulled, thus setting her on track to lose her Olympic medal. British journalist Nick Harris said that he contacted the IOC with allegations about Grigory Rodchenkov's laboratory in Moscow in early July 2013.According to Stepanov, \"Even at WADA there were people who didn't want this story out,\" but he said that a person at the organization put him in contact with the German broadcaster ARD. WADA's chief investigator Jack Robertson believed that the organization was reluctant to take action and that media attention was necessary, so he obtained the permission of WADA's director-general, David Howman, to approach an investigative reporter called Hajo Seppelt, who had previously reported on doping in East Germany and other countries. In December 2014, ARD aired Seppelt's documentary, \"Geheimsache Doping: 'Wie Russland seine Sieger macht'\" (\"The Doping Secret: 'How Russia Creates its Champions'\"), which uncovered alleged Russian state involvement in systematic doping, describing it as \"East German-style\". In the documentary, Stepanov and his wife Yuliya Stepanova (n\u00e9e Rusanova), claimed that Russian athletics officials had supplied banned substances in exchange for 5% of an athlete's earnings and had also falsified tests in cooperation with doping control officers. It included conversations that had been secretly recorded by Stepanova, e.g. Russian athlete Mariya Savinova saying that contacts at a Moscow drug-testing laboratory had covered up her doping. Russian long-distance runner Liliya Shobukhova allegedly paid 450,000 euros to cover up her positive doping result. According to the allegations, Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture, who stands accused of organising state-sponsored doping in the Soviet Union, dating back to the early 1980s, was also involved in the recent Russian doping programme.\n\n\n=== 2015 ===\n\nIn January 2015, then-All-Russia Athletic Federation President Valentin Balakhnichev resigned as treasurer of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).\n\nIn response to the ARD documentary, WADA commissioned an investigation headed by former anti-doping agency President Dick Pound, the report of which was published on 9 November 2015. The 335-page document, described as \"damning\" by The Guardian, reported widespread doping and large-scale cover-ups by the Russian authorities. It stated that the Federal Security Service (FSB) had regularly visited and questioned laboratory staff and instructed some of them not to cooperate with the WADA investigation. Two staff members said that they suspected that the offices and telephones were bugged. The report recommended that ARAF be declared non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code and that the IOC should not accept any 2016 Summer Olympics entries from ARAF until compliance was reached.A day later, WADA suspended the Moscow Anti-doping Center, prohibiting the laboratory \"from carrying out any WADA-related anti-doping activities including all analyses of urine and blood samples\". On 13 November, the IAAF council voted 22\u20131 in favour of prohibiting Russia from world track and field events with immediate effect. Under other penalties against the ARAF, Russia has been also prohibited from hosting the 2016 World Race Walking Team Championships (Cheboksary) and 2016 World Junior Championships (Kazan), and ARAF must entrust doping cases to Court of Arbitration for Sport. ARAF accepted the indefinite IAAF suspension and did not request a hearing. ARAF's efforts towards regaining full IAAF membership will be monitored by a five-person IAAF team. On 18 November 2015 WADA suspended RUSADA, meaning that Russia does not have a functioning NADO for any sport.In November 2015, France began a criminal investigation into former IAAF president Lamine Diack, alleging that in 2011 he accepted a 1 million euro bribe from the ARAF to cover up positive doping results of at least six Russian athletes.\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n==== January to May 2016 ====\nIn January 2016, the IAAF gave lifetime bans to the former head of the Russian athletics federation, Valentin Balakhnichev, and a top Russian coach, Aleksey Melnikov.In mid-January, WADA released the second report by its independent commission. The following month, the United Kingdom Anti-Doping (UKAD) agency was tasked to oversee testing in Russia.Two former directors of RUSADA, Vyacheslav Sinev and Nikita Kamaev, both died unexpectedly in February 2016. The Sunday Times reported that Kamaev had approached the newspaper shortly before his death planning to publish a book on \"the true story of sport pharmacology and doping in Russia since 1987\". Grigory Rodchenkov, the director of a prominent laboratory who has been described by WADA as \"the heart of Russian doping\", was fired by Russian authorities and fled in fear of his safety to the United States, where he shared information with the help of filmmaker Bryan Fogel, which was documented in the film Icarus.\nIn March 2016, German broadcaster ARD aired a documentary called \"Russia's Red Herrings\", alleging that athletes were alerted about testing plans and offered banned substances by individuals at RUSADA and ARAF. According to a May 2016 report in The New York Times, whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov said that doping experts collaborated with Russia's intelligence service on a state-sponsored doping programme in which urine samples were switched through a hole in the laboratory's wall. He said that at least fifteen medalists at the 2014 Winter Olympics were involved. On 19 May, WADA appointed Richard McLaren to lead an investigation into the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.On 15 March 2016, The International Olympic Committee announced that they were re-analyzing stored urine samples from the 2008 and 2012 Olympics using more advanced analytical methods to detect banned substances that would have gone unnoticed at the time of competition. Specific sports and countries were targeted, including in particular athletes likely to compete in Rio who also competed in London 2012 and Beijing 2008. Athletes from the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics were also being targeted as urine samples can only be stored for 10 years. The re-analysis programme would eventually conclude in November 2017.\nAway from the Olympics, Russian heavyweight boxer Alexander Povetkin and tennis player Maria Sharapova would both fail drug tests in March and May respectively, both testing positive for Meldonium. Russian-Finnish footballer Roman Eremenko would also fail a drugs test later on in the year.\n\n\n==== June 2016 ====\nAn ARD documentary in June 2016 implicated Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko in covering up doping by a football player at FK Krasnodar. In the same month, IAAF deputy general secretary Nick Davies was provisionally suspended over allegations that he took money to delay naming Russian athletes. According to the BBC, emails from July 2013 showed that Davies had discussed how to delay or soften an announcement on Russians who had tested positive.\n\nIn June 2016, WADA released a report stating that the work of its Doping Control Officers (DCO) had been limited by a \"significant amount of unavailable athlete reports and missed tests\", insufficient or incorrect athlete location information, and little information about the location or date of competitions. Some athletes named military cities requiring special permission to enter as their location and some national championships, including Olympic qualifiers, were held in cities with restricted access due to civil conflicts, preventing testing of the competitors. WADA also reported intimidation of DCOs by armed Federal Security Service (FSB) agents; \"significant delays\" before being allowed to enter venues; consistent monitoring by security staff; delays in receiving athlete lists; and opening of sample packages by Russian customs. 90% of Russian athletes did not respond or \"emphatically\" refused when WADA requested to interview them as part of its investigation. Director general David Howman stated, \"It was the very right time for those who considered themselves clean [to approach WADA]. They had nine months, plenty of time, and none came forward.\"On 17 June, the IAAF Council held an extraordinary meeting \"principally to give the Russian Athletics Federation (RusAF) a further opportunity to satisfy the Reinstatement Conditions for IAAF Membership\". A task force chaired by Rune Andersen recommended against reinstating Russia after reporting that criteria had not been met and that there were \"detailed allegations, which are already partly substantiated, that the Russian authorities, far from supporting the anti-doping effort, have in fact orchestrated systematic doping and the covering up of adverse analytical findings\". The IAAF voted unanimously to uphold its ban.A week later, the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) decided to give a one-year ban to Russia, along with two other countries; on 3 August 2016 the IOC ratified the decision, and Russia's weightlifting team missed the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n==== July 2016 ====\n\nOn 18 July 2016, Richard McLaren, a Canadian attorney retained by WADA to investigate Rodchenkov's allegations, published a 97-page report covering significant state-sponsored doping in Russia. Although limited by a 57-day time frame, the investigation found corroborating evidence after conducting witness interviews, reviewing thousands of documents, analysis of hard drives, forensic analysis of urine sample collection bottles, and laboratory analysis of individual athlete samples, with \"more evidence becoming available by the day\". The report concluded that it was shown \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that Russia's Ministry of Sport, the Centre of Sports Preparation of the National Teams of Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB), and the WADA-accredited laboratory in Moscow had \"operated for the protection of doped Russian athletes\" within a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using \"the disappearing positive [test] methodology\" (DPM) after the country's poor medal count during the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver. McLaren stated that urine samples were opened in Sochi in order to swap them \"without any evidence to the untrained eye\". The official producer of BEREG-KIT security bottles used for anti-doping tests, Berlinger Group, stated, \"We have no knowledge of the specifications, the methods or the procedures involved in the tests and experiments conducted by the McLaren Commission.\"According to the McLaren report, the DPM operated from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\". It was used on 643 positive samples, a number that the authors consider \"only a minimum\" due to limited access to Russian records. The system covered up positive results in a wide range of sports:\n\nIn response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code and recommended that Russian athletes be banned from competing at the 2016 Summer Olympics. The IOC decided to decline 2016 Summer Olympics accreditation requests by Russian sports ministry officials and any individuals implicated in the report, to begin re-analysis and a full inquiry into Russian competitors at the Sochi Olympics, and to ask sports federations to seek alternative hosts for major events that had been assigned to Russia.On 21 July 2016, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) turned down an appeal by the Russian Olympic Committee and 68 Russian athletes. The following day, the International Paralympic Committee began suspension proceedings against the National Paralympic Committee of Russia. On 24 July, the IOC rejected WADA's recommendation to ban Russia from the Summer Olympics and announced that a decision would be made by each sport federation. With each positive decision having to be approved by a CAS arbitrator. WADA's president Craig Reedie said, \"WADA is disappointed that the IOC did not heed WADA's Executive Committee recommendations that were based on the outcomes of the McLaren Investigation and would have ensured a straight-forward, strong and harmonized approach.\" On the IOC's decision to exclude Stepanova, WADA director general Olivier Niggli stated that his agency was \"very concerned by the message that this sends whistleblowers for the future\".On 30 July 2016 the IOC announced that a final decision on each athlete would be made by a newly established IOC panel consisting of Ugur Erdener, Claudia Bokel, and Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr.\n\n\n==== August to September 2016 ====\n\nOriginally Russia submitted a list of 389 athletes for the Rio Olympics competition. On 7 August 2016, the IOC cleared 278 athletes, while 111 were removed because of the scandal (including 67 athletes removed by IAAF before the IOC's decision).\n\nCritics noted that Kuwaitis were banned from competing under their own flag (for a non-doping related matter) while Russians were permitted to do so. Due to governmental interference, Kuwaiti competitors were permitted to enter only as independent athletes. Dick Pound stated, \"It is not a consistent standard which is being applied now. Not all Kuwait athletes banned from competing in Rio under their own flag were supporters of the regime, and not all South African athletes were supporters of apartheid, but the greater good called for South Africa to be expelled.\" Germany's Deutsche Welle wrote of \"troublesome questions, like why Kuwait's Olympic federation faced a ban from Rio, while Russia's did not. Kuwait's tiny team [...] was suspended because of improper political conduct by the government; Russia's was not, after systematically organizing a doping program for many of its competitors.\"Having sent samples for forensic analysis, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) found evidence that the Disappearing Positive Methodology (DPM) was in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi. On 7 August 2016, the IPC's Governing Board voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, citing the Russian Paralympic Committee's (RPC) inability to enforce the IPC's Anti-Doping Code and the World Anti-Doping Code, which is \"a fundamental constitutional requirement\". IPC President Sir Philip Craven described the Russian anti-doping system as \"entirely compromised\" and 18 July 2016 as \"one of the darkest days in the history of all sport\", and stated that the Russian government had \"catastrophically failed its Para athletes\". IPC Athletes' Council Chairperson Todd Nicholson said that Russia had used athletes as \"pawns\" in order to \"show global prowess\". On 23 August 2016, the Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed Russia's appeal, stating that the IPC's decision was \"made in accordance with the IPC Rules and was proportionate in the circumstances\" and that Russia \"did not file any evidence contradicting the facts on which the IPC decision was based\". The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland rejected another appeal by Russia, saying that the RPC \"needed to demonstrate it had fulfilled its obligations in upholding... anti-doping protocols, and that its interests in an immediate lifting of its suspension outweigh the International Paralympics Committee's interests in fighting doping and in the integrity of athletics. It did not succeed in this in any way.\" Rejecting an appeal by ten athletes, a German court stated that the IPC had no obligation to allow them to compete and that the committee had \"comprehensibly justified\" its decision.In an interview with NRK, WADA's director general Olivier Niggli said that \"Russia is threatening us and our informers\", mentioning daily hacking attempts and bugging of houses. He said that the agency had \"a pretty good suspicion\" that the hackers were Russian and that Western governments were already familiar with them. He stated, \"I think this will cease if they stop looking at us as an enemy, and instead accept that there is a problem that we must work together to solve. But for the moment they are sending out completely the wrong signals.\"\n\n\n==== October to December 2016 ====\n\nIn October 2016, Russia's sports minister Vitaly Mutko was promoted to deputy prime minister amid allegations that Mutko had covered up a doping violation.On 3 November 2016, Russia approved an anti-doping law targeting coaches.On 15 November 2016, Berlinger introduced a new design for doping sample bottles. A spokesman later said, \"We work with forensic specialists from different nations. We want to always stay a little bit ahead of those cheating but you cannot avoid a system like the Russians built up.\"On 7 December 2016, Yelena Isinbayeva became the chair of the supervisory board of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency.On 9 December 2016, McLaren published the second part of his report. The report claimed that from 2011 to 2015, more than 1,000 Russian competitors in various sports (including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports) benefited from the cover-up. However, McLaren later walked back from that assertion when the cases went to court, rephrasing it as not a fact but only a possibility, as recorded on page 68 of the CAS verdict for Alexander Legkov: \"Prof. McLaren went on to explain that, in this respect, if his investigation obtained evidence that a particular athlete may have benefited from the scheme, then 'It didn't mean that they did benefit. It didn't mean that they committed [an] anti-doping rule violation.'\" Emails indicate that those who might have benefited from a cover-up included five blind powerlifters, who may have been given drugs without their knowledge, and a fifteen-year-old. An IAAF taskforce announced that Russia could not be reinstated because the country still had no functional drug-testing agency and had not accepted the findings of investigations.\n\n\n=== 2017 ===\n\n\n==== January to October 2017 ====\nIn February 2017, All-Russia Athletic Federation vice-president Andrey Silnov held a press conference in Moscow alongside a former Soviet athlete who said that East German successes due to state-sponsored doping are legitimate results of \"good pharmacology\" and should not be condemned. Later that month, WADA stated that evidence against many individuals named in the McLaren report might be insufficient because the Moscow laboratory had disposed of doping samples and Russian authorities were not answering requests for additional evidence.An IAAF taskforce chaired by Rune Andersen published an interim report in April 2017. President Sebastian Coe stated, \"There is testing but it is still far too limited. The Russian investigative committee is still refusing to hand over athlete biological passport samples for independent testing from labs, we still have got athletes in closed cities that are difficult or impossible to get to, the ongoing employment of coaches from a tainted system, and we have got the head coach of RUSAF effectively refusing to sign their own pledge to clean athletics.\" The report also noted the case of whistleblower Andrei Dmitriev, who had fled Russia after being threatened with imprisonment. Coe said, \"Anyone with information about a system which has failed to protect the goals and aspirations of clean athletes must feel it is safe to speak out.\" Andersen questioned the selection of Yelena Isinbayeva, who had called for whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova to be \"banned for life\", as the chair of RUSADA's supervisory board. Andersen stated, \"It is difficult to see how this helps to achieve the desired change in culture in track and field, or how it helps to promote an open environment for Russian whistleblowers\", noting that Isinbayeva had called a WADA report \"groundless\" without reading it, publicly criticised whistleblowers (Dmitriev and the Stepanovs), and had not signed a pledge for clean sport or endorsed a Russian anti-doping group.In September 2017, WADA rejected Russia's claims that WADA should be held responsible for Rodchenkov, noting that Russia had chosen to appoint him as head of the Moscow laboratory. The organisation also stated, \"WADA would expect the Russian authorities to take responsibility for this deliberate system of cheating that was uncovered by the McLaren Investigation \u2013 as is stipulated within RUSADA's Roadmap to Compliance \u2013 rather than continually shifting the blame onto others.\" Seventeen national anti-doping organisations criticised the IOC for a \"continuing refusal to hold Russia accountable for one of the biggest doping scandals in sports history\" and \"dereliction of duty [sending] a cynical message that those of favored, insider nations within the Olympic Movement will never be punished or held accountable\". They stated that cases had been \"shut prematurely before the IOC or IFs have obtained complete evidence from the Moscow laboratory or interviewed the relevant witnesses\". An additional 20 NADOs have signed on.\n\n\n==== November to December 2017 ====\n\nIn November 2017, the IOC disciplinary commission headed by Denis Oswald imposed its first sanctions after a year-long Sochi investigation. As of 22 December 2017, 43 Russian athletes had been sanctioned and 13 medals had been stripped.\nOn 10 November 2017, the day after Vladimir Putin accused the U.S. of stirring up problems for Russian athletes, WADA said in a news release that it had obtained an electronic file that contained \"all testing data\" from January 2012 to August 2015 \u2013 thousands of drug screenings run on Russian athletes. The database, which the Russian authorities were unwilling to share with antidoping investigators, arrived through a whistleblower. The head of the Russian Ski Association, Yelena V\u00e4lbe, told the press that \"whistleblowers are traitors to their country\" shortly thereafter. Russia's ski team coach went even further and accused Ilia Chernousov (a skier who won a bronze medal in the 50 km freestyle event) of \"leaking information\" to WADA.On 11 November 2017, it was revealed that Grigory Rodchenkov had provided new evidence of Russian state-sponsored doping to the IOC, noting that he would consider going public if the Schmid Commission did not give due weight to his evidence in any public findings.On 16 November 2017, WADA announced that Russia remained non-compliant with its Code. On 26 November 2017, IAAF decided to maintain Russia's ban from international track and field competitions, saying the country had not done enough to tackle doping.The last athletes to be sanctioned as part of the International Olympic Committees re-analysis programme was on 30 November 2017. In total, 48 athletes from the 2012 Olympics were sanctioned as part of the programme, including 22 Russians and 61 from the 2008 Olympics including 19 Russians. Only one athlete was sanctioned from the 2010 Olympics and they were not Russian and no athletes failed tests from the 2006 Olympics.In an interview with the New York Times, Rodchenkov reported that Yuri Nagornykh, the deputy minister of sport, had asked him to incriminate a Ukrainian athlete, Vita Semerenko, during a competition in Moscow leading up to the Olympics. Rodchenkov did not comply, convincing the minister that a retest of the drug sample would show the drugs had been spiked into the sample rather than passed through a human body. \"I could not have done this to an innocent athlete,\" he said. \"During my career, I reported many Dirty Samples as clean, but never the other way around.\"\n\n\n==== Official sanctions ====\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended with immediate effect from the 2018 Winter Olympics, but their concession was to allow those Russian athletes with no previous drug violations and a consistent history of drug testing to compete under the Olympic Flag as an \"Olympic Athlete from Russia\" (OAR). Under the terms of the IOC's edict, no Russian government officials were permitted to attend the Games, and neither the Russian flag nor the Russian national anthem would be featured; the Olympic Flag and Olympic Anthem were to be used instead. On 20 December 2017, the IOC proposed an alternative logo for the OAR athletes' uniforms (shown on right). IOC President Thomas Bach said that \"after following due process [the IOC] has issued proportional sanctions for this systematic manipulation while protecting the clean athletes.\"As of January 2018, the IOC had identified 43 Russian athletes from the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi that it intended to ban from competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics and all other future Olympic Games as part of the Oswald Commission. All but one of those athletes appealed against their bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The court overturned the sanctions on 28 of the appellants, resulting in their Sochi medals and results being reinstated, but the court ruled that there was sufficient evidence against eleven of the athletes to uphold their Sochi sanctions. The IOC issued a statement saying \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\" and that \"this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\". The IOC found it imperative to point out that the CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\" and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. The court also downgraded the punishment by deciding that the 39 athletes should only be banned from the 2018 Games, not all future Olympic Games. The remaining three Russian athletes are awaiting their hearings which will be conducted after the 2018 Games. After the partially successful appeal, 47 Russian athletes and coaches launched a further appeal to the CAS, in a final attempt to secure an invitation to the Games. This appeal was dismissed on 9 February 2018, the day of the opening ceremony, a decision that was welcomed by the IOC.An original pool of 500 Russian athletes was put forward for consideration for the 2018 Games and 111 of those athletes were immediately eliminated from the pool; this included the 43 athletes who had been sanctioned by the Oswald Commission. The remaining 389 athletes were required to meet a number of pre-games conditions, such as a further round of tests and re-analysis of stored samples, and they would only be considered for invitation to the Games providing these requirements were met. The final number of neutral Russian athletes that were invited to compete was 169. However, speed skater Olga Graf chose not to compete, stating that \"the sport has become a bargaining chip in dirty political games\", bringing the eventual total to 168.\n\n\n==== Reaction in Russia ====\nIn the past, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and other government officials had stated that it would be a humiliation for Russia if its athletes were not allowed to compete at the Olympics under the Russian flag. However, despite rumours to the contrary, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov later revealed that no boycott had been discussed leading up to the IOC's announcement. After the IOC decision was made public, Ramzan Kadyrov, the Head of Chechnya, announced that no Chechen athletes would be allowed to compete under a neutral flag. On 6 December 2017, Putin confirmed that the Russian government would not prevent any of its athletes from participating at the 2018 Games as individuals, despite there being calls from other leading Russian politicians for a boycott. Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, put forward a proposal to send fans to the Games with a Soviet Victory Banner. Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, commented that the United States \"fears honest competition\", affirming Vladimir Putin's position that the United States used its influence within the IOC to \"orchestrate the doping scandal\". According to Komsomolskaya Pravda, a popular Russian tabloid newspaper, 86% of the Russian population opposed participation in the Winter Olympics under a neutral flag. Many Russians believed that the IOC was retaliating against Russia for their discriminatory anti-gay law which provoked considerable controversy with the IOC during the 2014 Winter Olympics when it was hosted in Sochi, Russia.\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\n\n\n==== January to February 2018 ====\nIn January 2018, it was reported that all leading Russian athletes avoided meeting doping officers and passing anti-doping tests in a track and field competition in Irkutsk.During the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February 2018, two Russian athletes from the Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) delegation failed doping tests and were disqualified: curler Aleksandr Krushelnitckii who won a bronze medal in the mixed doubles event; and bobsleigh pilot Nadezhda Sergeeva who finished twelfth in the two-woman event. The IOC expressed their disappointment at the positive doping tests and stated that the OAR team would consequently not be allowed to parade under the Russian flag at the closing ceremony.Despite the two disqualifications, the IOC announced on 28 February that it had chosen to reinstate Russia's Olympic membership, just days after the end of the Winter Games, as no more cases of doping had been found in the delegation. The surprise decision to lift the suspension provoked anger among the international sporting community. The IOC had planned all along to reinstate Russia after the Games provided there were no more failed tests. Their statement read \"The suspension of the Russian Olympic Committee is automatically lifted with immediate effect.\"\n\n\n==== May to August 2018 ====\nIn the buildup to the 2018 FIFA World Cup hosted by Russia, lab director and whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov said that he recognised one of Russia's players as a doper in one of his own doping programmes. FIFA had opened an inquiry into Russian doping in football after the Mclaren report was published with 33 Russian footballers named in it, but said in May that they had found 'insufficient evidence' of doping but said that some cases with players unrelated to the World Cup were ongoing. The tournament eventually concluded with no players failing a drugs test. A few months after the tournament had concluded in September, the father of Russian player Denis Cheryshev said that his son had been taking growth hormone during the tournament. He was later cleared of doping by anti-doping authorities.On 20 July, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) released details of 120 doping cases with some 85 of the cases involving Olympic and World Championships medallists and almost half (47.5%) involving Russians. On 27 July, 10 days before the start of the 2018 European Athletics Championships, the IAAF announced that despite making improvements in key areas, Russia would still remain suspended from international athletics competitions. 29 Russian athletes still competed in the championships as Authorised Neutral Athletes, and Russia eventually topped the medal table of the inaugural European Championships.\n\n\n==== September 2018 ====\nThe World-Anti Doping Agency voted on 20 September whether or not to re-instate the Russian Anti-Doping Agency after they were suspended in 2015. A WADA compliance review committee had recommended that RUSADA be re-instated which sparked anger from international athletes and officials. One of the members of the six-person review committee, Beckie Scott, the chair of WADA'S athletes commission, left her role on the committee in protest over the recommendation to reinstate RUSADA and the vice president of the agency Linda Helleland said that she would vote against their re-admission. A group of athletes from UK-Anti-Doping had earlier called for Russia to remained banned until they had overhauled its Anti-Doping System saying that Russia's re-admission would be 'a catastrophe for clean sport' and a member of US Anti-Doping Agency was quoted as saying 'frankly, it stinks to high heaven'. The former head of the Moscow laboratory turned whistle-blower Grigory Rodchenkov said that lifting Russia's ban would be a 'catastrophe'.WADA had insisted that Russia meet two criteria before RUSADA could be re-admitted; accept the findings of the McLaren Report and grant access to Moscow's anti-doping laboratory. The compliance review committee had reviewed a letter from the Russian Sports Ministry that said it had 'sufficiently acknowledged the issues identified in Russia' and that they agree to accept the two remaining conditions'.WADA voted unanimously to re-instate the Russian Anti-Doping Agency at their congress in the Seychelles, going against the wishes of numerous national Anti-Doping agencies around the world. The lawyer for whistle-blower Grigory Rodchenkov called it \"the greatest treachery against clean athletes in Olympic history\" whilst US Anti-Doping Agency head Travis Tygart said the decision is \"bewildering and inexplicable\" and a \"devastating blow to the world's clean athletes\". The decision received so much criticism that the head of WADA, Craig Reedie, had to publicly defend the decision as he came under mounting criticism.With RUSADA now re-instated, the Russian Athletics Federation launched a legal challenge to the IAAF to overturn their ban from athletics competitions from which they were still suspended. The IAAF, however, refused the request, which was later withdrawn by the Russian athletics federation. By 26 September 2018, 77 Russians were serving doping bans in the sport of Athletics including 72 athletes and 5 coaches and athlete support personnel.\n\n\n==== November to December 2018 ====\nIt was announced in November that the International Olympic Committee would further re-analyse stored samples from the 2012 Olympics, testing for all banned substances. This came after 48 adverse analytical findings were found in previous re-analysis of samples with 22 of them being RussianOn 14 December 2018, Hugo Lowell at The i newspaper reported from Moscow that officials at the Russian Ministry of Sport were still reluctant to cooperate fully with WADA over turning over the testing data from its anti-doping laboratory. WADA subsequently released a statement that said their Expert Team had flown to extract the data. Later, it emerged that WADA was unsuccessful in retrieving the data because their equipment had allegedly not been properly certified.\nThe reinstatement of RUSADA prompted allegations of bullying and a call for reform within the World Anti-Doping Agency, however the IAAF decided to uphold Russia's suspension from athletics into 2019 with 63 Russians cleared to compete as neutral athletes for the year. A team of five WADA experts traveled to Moscow on 17 December expected to be given full access to the laboratory, but on arrival they were refused full access which put RUSADA on the brink of being suspended once more with their president Yuri Ganus appealing to Vladimir Putin personally for a resolution.\n\n\n=== 2019 ===\n\n\n==== January 2019 ====\nWADA had set Russia a strict deadline to hand over data from their Moscow laboratory by 31 December, a deadline which they evidently missed. There were calls for the WADA compliance review committee to meet immediately to consider their next steps, however they decided to meet much later on 14 January which caused anger among the international community with 16 national anti-doping bodies calling for Russia's suspension once more. WADA president Dick Pound described the reaction to their decision as like a 'lynch mob'.WADA eventually gained full access to the Moscow laboratory on 10 January, 10 days after the initial deadline. The WADA president described it as a 'major breakthrough for clean sport' and said that they were now starting their second phase of authentication and review of the data that had been collected to make sure that it had not been compromised and to build strong cases against Russian athletes that might have doped. WADA eventually managed to retrieve 2262 samples from the Moscow lab. Despite missing the deadline, RUSADA was still deemed compliant and was not punished. The Institute of National Anti-Doping Organisations (iNADO) said that 'Russia has been granted more chances and, ultimately, leniency than any individual athlete or small country could expect to receive. This is very troubling'.\n\n\n==== February to March 2019 ====\nIt was announced on 8 February that the International Paralympic Committee would now re-instate Russia by 15 March after they were suspended in July 2016. They stated that 69 of the 70 reinstatement criteria had been met with the last criteria being to accept the findings of the McLaren report. Meanwhile, Russia's ban in athletics was upheld by the IAAF 'until further notice' stating that there were two outstanding issues that needed to be resolved.On 19 March, France issued arrest warrants for two former Russian athletics officials as part of an investigation into a doping cover-up. The former head of Russian athletics Valentin Balakhnichev and the ex-coach of the Russian athletics team Alexei Melnikov, who were both banned from the sport for life in 2016, were targeted.\n\n\n==== June to July 2019 ====\nRussia's 2008 Olympic high jump champion Andrey Silnov stepped down from his position as the vice-president of the Russian Athletics Federation in June after it was reported that he was under investigation for a possible doping violation following a re-analysis of his sample from 2013. It was also reported that seven Russian track and field athletes, including athletes from the national team, were caught training in Kyrgyzstan with Vladimir Kazarin, a coach who was banned from the sport for life in 2017 for doping offences. With all of that in mind, Russia was in danger of remaining suspended for the 2019 World Athletics Championships in September after the IAAF voted to uphold their ban, the 11th time they had done so. In July 2019 Reuters reported that two Olympic Russian boxers competed in 2018 while serving doping bans applied by RUSADA. Reuters said this indicated an inconsistency in Russia's reform of its anti-doping practices. After Reuters notified it of the two cases RUSADA said it would investigate.The first cases of possible Anti-Doping violations against Russian athletes' samples taken from the Moscow Laboratory were handed over to the individual sporting federations in July. WADA said that the data of 43 athletes had been handed over out of a target pool of 298 athletes. The first sporting federation to suspend athletes from the data received was the International Weightlifting Federation who suspended 12 Russian weightlifters including Olympic, World and European medalists.\n\n\n==== September to December 2019 ====\nOn 21 September, it was widely reported that some of the data retrieved from the Moscow laboratory may have been manipulated and tampered with before it was retrieved by the World Anti-Doping Agency. This meant that Russia would remain suspended from the then-upcoming 2019 World Athletics Championships, and faced a possible ban from hosting and competing in all major sporting events including the upcoming 2020 Olympics and possibly the 2022 Olympics, 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2024 Olympics.Two months later on 21 November, a number of Russian athletics officials were suspended for obstructing and failing to co-operate with an investigation into the whereabouts of high-jumper Danil Lysenko. President of the Russian Athletics Federation Dmitry Shlyakhtin was suspended along with 6 others associated with RusAF, including the athlete and his coach.WADA then recommended that Russia be declared non-compliant once more and banned from hosting sporting events for four years. On 9 December, WADA banned Russia from major international sporting events for four years, on charges of tampering with doping-related reports. Russia will be barred from hosting, participating in, or establishing bids for international sporting events during this period. As before, WADA will allow cleared Russian athletes to compete neutrally, but not under the Russian flag. This will not affect Russia's co-hosting of UEFA Euro 2020, as WADA does not recognize UEFA as a \"major event organization\" covered by the ban. In regard to this sanction, WADA president Craig Reedie said that \"For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport\". He also added that  \"Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and rejoin the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial\".\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n\n\n==== January to April 2020 ====\nIn January 2020, WADA suspended the Moscow laboratory from carrying out its only remaining accreditation, analysis of blood samples. The Moscow laboratory had been allowed to carry out analysis of blood samples since May 2016 as \"practically impossible for laboratories to interfere with the blood variables of samples due to the nature of the analytical equipment and the athlete biological passport principles in place\".On 30 April, WADA announced that they had completed their 'painstaking' investigation of the 298 Russian athletes who's data they had received from the Moscow laboratory in January 2019. The first data was handed over in July and a total of 27 international sporting federations and one major event organisation received the data in order to decide on possible anti-doping violations being brought forward.\n\n\n== International competitions ==\n\n\n=== Russian hosting ===\n\nAlthough the IOC stated in July 2016 that it would ask sports federations to seek alternative hosts, Russia has retained hosting rights for some major international sports events, including the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, 2018 FIFA World Cup, and 2019 Winter Universiade. In September 2016, Russia was awarded hosting rights for the 2021 World Biathlon Championships because the IOC's recommendation did not apply to events that had already been awarded or planned bids from the country.Olympic medalists Steven Holcomb, Matthew Antoine, Martins Dukurs, and Lizzy Yarnold questioned the decision to hold the FIBT World Championships 2017 in Sochi, with boycotts considered by Austria, Latvia, and South Korea. Latvia's skeleton team confirmed that it would boycott if Sochi remained the host, saying that the \"Olympic spirit was stolen in 2014.\" On 13 December 2016, the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation announced that it would relocate the event. Some athletes were concerned that they might unwittingly ingest a banned substance if the host tampered with food or drinks, while others \"were worried about the evidence that Russian laboratories had been opening tamper-proof bottles. If they have opened these bottles to help their athletes, what is to stop them also opening them to tamper with samples from any athlete in the competition?\"Biathlon teams from the Czech Republic and Great Britain decided to boycott a 2016\u201317 Biathlon World Cup stage in Tyumen. On 22 December 2016, Russia announced it would not host the World Cup event or the 2017 Biathlon Junior World Championships in Ostrov. The same day, the International Skating Union decided to relocate a speed skating event, the 2016\u201317 ISU Speed Skating World Cup stage in Chelyabinsk, due to \"a substantial amount of critical evidence and the uncertainty relating to the attendance of the athletes\". Russia was later removed as host of the 2016\u201317 FIS Cross-Country World Cup final stage and 2021 World Biathlon Championships in Tyumen.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA fired Jiri Dvorak, a doctor, who had been investigating doping in Russian football. However, FIFA stated that removal of Dvorak was unrelated to his investigation of doping in Russian sports.\n\n\n=== Russian participation ===\n\n19 national anti-doping organisations recommended suspending Russia from participation in all sports. Russia was suspended from athletics, weightlifting, Paralympic sport competitions, but has continued its participation in other sports.The IAAF permitted Russians who have undergone testing by non-Russian agencies to compete as neutral athletes. The Russian flag, national colours, and anthem were banned.There were calls to ban Russia from participating in the 2018 Winter Olympics and 2018 Winter Paralympics or to allow Russian athletes to compete only as neutrals.\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nRussian doping has been featured in several documentaries broadcast in Germany, France, and the United States:\n\nGeheimsache Doping: Wie Russland seine Sieger macht (The Doping Secret: How Russia Creates Champions), ARD / Das Erste, aired 3 December 2014\nGeheimsache Doping. Im Schattenreich der Leichtathletik (The Doping Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics), ARD / Das Erste, aired 1 August 2015\nGeheimsache Doping: Russlands T\u00e4uschungsman\u00f6ver (The Doping Secret: Russia's Red Herrings), ARD / Westdeutscher Rundfunk, aired 6 March 2016\nRussia's Dark Secret, 60 Minutes / CBS News, aired 8 May 2016\nPlus vite, plus haut, plus dop\u00e9s (Faster, higher, more doped), Arte in partnership with Le Monde, aired 7 June 2016\nIcarus, Netflix, directed by Bryan Fogel, 2017\nInside edge on Amazon prime\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== International ===\nSome athletes from other countries have criticised WADA, alleging that the agency has been reluctant to investigate Russia despite multiple tips over several years. WADA officials stated that the agency lacked the authority to carry out its own investigations until 2015. Arne Ljungqvist, WADA's former vice chairman, commented that \"WADA always had an excuse as to why they wouldn't move forward. They expected Russia to clean up themselves.\" In June 2016, The Guardian reported that a letter approved by over twenty athletes' groups from multiple sports and countries as well as the chairs of the IOC's and WADA's athletes committees, Claudia Bokel and Beckie Scott, had been sent to IOC president Thomas Bach and WADA head Craig Reedie; the letter criticised the organisations for inaction and silence until the media became involved and said that athlete confidence in the anti-doping system had been \"shattered\".On 18 July 2016, WADA's Athlete Committee stated, \"Although we have known of the allegations, to read the report today, to see the weight of the evidence, and to see the scale of doping and deception is astounding.\" The athlete committee, the Institute of National Anti-Doping Organizations, and the leaders of anti-doping agencies in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States called for Russia to be banned from the 2016 Olympics in Rio. After Bach delayed a decision on whether to ban the entire Russian team, IOC member Dick Pound said, \"the IOC is for some reason very reluctant to think about a total exclusion of the Russian team. But we've got institutionalized, government-organised cheating on a wide scale across a whole range of sports in a country. You've got to keep from turning [zero tolerance] into: 'We have zero tolerance except for Russia.'\" Bruce Arthur of the Toronto Star said, \"If the threshold Russia established is not high enough to merit a total ban from an Olympic Games, it's a remarkable precedent to set.\" Former IOC vice president, Kevan Gosper of Australia, said, \"we have to be very careful [about making] the wrong move with an important country like Russia\", to which Richard Hind of The Daily Telegraph (Sydney) responded, \"And there is the IOC in a nutshell. There are nations, and there are 'important nations'. Not everyone pees in the same specimen jar.\"The IOC's decision on 24 July 2016 was criticised by athletes and writers. It received support from the European Olympic Committees, which said that Russia is \"a valued member\". Cam Cole of Canada's National Post said that the IOC had \"caved, as it always does, defaulting to whatever compromise it could safely adopt without offending a superpower\". Expressing disappointment, a member of the IOC Athletes' Commission, Hayley Wickenheiser, wrote, \"I ask myself if we were not dealing with Russia would this decision to ban a nation [have] been an easier one? I fear the answer is yes.\" Writing for Deutsche Welle in Germany, Olivia Gerstenberger said that Bach had \"flunked\" his first serious test, adding, \"With this decision, the credibility of the organization is shattered once more, while that of state-sponsored doping actually receives a minor boost.\" Bild (Germany) described Bach as \"Putin's poodle\". Paul Hayward, chief sports writer of The Daily Telegraph (UK), remarked, \"The white flag of capitulation flies over the International Olympic Committee. Russia's deep political reach should have told us this would happen.\"Leaders of thirteen national anti-doping organisations wrote that the IOC had \"violated the athletes' fundamental rights to participate in Games that meet the stringent requirements of the World Anti-Doping Code\" and \"[demonstrated that] it lacks the independence required to keep commercial and political interests from influencing the tough decisions necessary to protect clean sport\". WADA's former chief investigator, Jack Robertson, said \"The anti-doping code is now just suggestions to follow or not\" and that \"WADA handed the IOC that excuse [not enough time before the Olympics] by sitting on the allegations for close to a year.\" McLaren was dissatisfied with the IOC's handling of his report, saying \"It was about state-sponsored doping and the misrecording of doping results and they turned the focus into individual athletes and whether they should compete. [...] it was a complete turning upside down of what was in the report and passing over responsibility to all the different international federations.\"\n\n\n=== In Russia ===\n\nSome Russians described the allegations as an anti-Russian plot while others stated that Russia was \"just doing what the rest of the world does\". Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia had \"never supported any violations in sport, we have never supported it at the state level, and we will never support this\" and that the allegations were part of an \"anti-Russia policy\" by the West. Aleksei Pushkov, chairman of Russia's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said that the IAAF's decision to uphold its ban was \"an act of political revenge against Russia for its independent foreign policy\". A member of Russia's parliament, Vadim Dengin, stated, \"The entire doping scandal is a pure falsification, invented to discredit and humiliate Russia.\" After the Court of Arbitration for Sport turned down an appeal by Russian athletes, pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva wrote, \"Let all those pseudo-clean foreign athletes breathe a sigh of relief and win their pseudo gold medals in our absence. They always did fear strength.\" The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the ruling a \"crime against sport\". A poll by the Levada Center found that 14% of Russians believed that the country's athletes had doped in Sochi, 71% did not believe WADA's reports, and 15% decided not to answer.A spokesman for Putin called Stepanova a \"Judas\". The Russian media have also criticised the Stepanovs. Yuliya Stepanova said, \"All the news stories call me a traitor and not just traitor but a traitor to the Motherland.\" Vitaly Stepanov said, \"I wasn't trying to expose Russia, I was trying to expose corrupt sports officials that are completely messing up competitions not just inside the country but globally.\" Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that the Russian media portrayed the German documentaries as \"part of a Western conspiracy with the aim of weakening the great nation that Vladimir Putin lifted from its knees\". Hajo Seppelt had the \"impression that he and the Stepanovs were being styled as enemies of the state\".Dick Pound described Russia's response as \"a bit like when you get stopped for speeding on the freeway by the police and you say 'Why me? Everyone else was doing it'.\" He stated that if Russia's authorities had \"responded to their issues they could easily have enough time to sort everything out in time for Rio. But instead, they played the role of victims, claiming there was a plot against them for too long.\" Leonid Bershidsky, a Russian writer for Bloomberg View, wrote that Russia's \"officials need to understand that \"whataboutism\" doesn't avert investigations\". The Moscow correspondent of Deutsche Welle, Juri Rescheto, wrote that the response he saw in Russia \"shows that the country is living in a parallel universe\" and seeks to blame others. Writing for The New York Times, Andrew E. Kramer said that Russia responded to the IAAF's decision against reinstatement with \"victimhood\" reflecting a \"culture of grievances that revolves around perceived slights and anti-Russian conspiracies taking place in the outside world, particularly in Western countries\". The newspaper's editorial board also saw a \"narrative of victimization\" in Russia, and wrote that it resembled how the Soviet Union would respond to a punishment \u2013 by saying that it was \"politically motivated, always a provocation, never justified. [Even] though the Cold War is long over, President Vladimir Putin remains stuck in the same, snarling defensive crouch in his responses to any accusations of Russian foul play\". Andrew Osborn of Reuters wrote that the Russian government had \"deftly deflected the blame by passing it off as a Western Cold War-style plot to sabotage Russia's international comeback\". In response to Russia's opinion that the allegations were \"politically motivated\", WADA's former chief investigator, Jack Robertson, said that he saw politics \"when Craig Reedie tried to intervene by writing emails to the Russian ministry to console them\".Match TV said that Americans had orchestrated the doping scandal, and modern pentathlon champion Aleksander Lesun called it an unfair \"attack\", because \"Doping is in all countries and there are violators everywhere.\" Following the IOC's announcement on 24 July 2016, Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko said it was \"a just and fair decision and we hope every federation will take the same kind of decision. Doping is a worldwide evil, not only of Russia.\" The Russian media's reaction was \"nearly euphoric at points\".A reporter from Russian state-owned television told IOC President Thomas Bach that \"It looked like you personally were helping us,\" and asked whether the doping investigation was a \"political attack\" on Russian athletes. After Russian athletes said that McLaren was about \"politics\" rather than sport, the British biathlon association stated that their comments were \"brain-washed, deluded and dishonest\" and decided to boycott an event in Russia. Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that athletes should be \"punished\" for calls to boycott.On 7 December 2017, it was reported that Russian oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov paid a Russian Olympic athlete millions of rubles in hush money not to reveal Russia's elaborate doping scheme. Prokhorov had run the Russian Biathlon Union from 2008 to 2014 and offered legal services to disqualified Russian biathletes.In Russia, the December 2019 sanction was received with outrage. President Vladimir Putin slammed the decision as a \"politically motivated\" ruling that \"contradicted\" the Olympic Charter. \"There is nothing to reproach the Russian Olympic Committee for and if there is no reproach towards this committee, the country should take part in competitions under its own flag,\" Putin said. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev also said the ban was politically motivated. \"This is the continuation of this anti-Russian hysteria that has already become chronic,\" Medvedev told domestic press.\n\n\n==== 2017 Sochi bans ====\n\nThe fallout from the IOC bans of Russian athletes caught doping at the Sochi Olympics, which left previous Russian whistleblowers in fear of their own personal safety, has been likened to a \"witch-hunt\" within the Russian winter sports community. On 9 November 2017, Vladimir Putin called the decisions to ban Russian athletes for doping violations an attempt by the U.S. to undermine his nation and affect the Russian presidential election in March.According to Russian news agency TASS, the Russian sports minister Pavel Kolobkov said that the investigative committee had found no evidence that the state was operating a doping system; that same committee was seeking whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov's extradition from the United States, where he is in witness protection. Despite reassurances from Russian officials that no doping system existed, IOC official Dick Pound said: \"empirical evidence is totally to the contrary, so I think what we're seeing in the Russian press is for domestic consumption.\"On 17 November 2017, top Russian Olympic official Leonid Tyagachev said that Grigory Rodchenkov, who had alleged that Russia was running a systematic doping programme, \"should be shot for lying, like Stalin would have done\".\n\n\n=== 2018 Olympic ban ===\nThe IOC's decision was criticized by Jack Robertson, primary investigator of the Russian doping programme on behalf of WADA, who said that the IOC had issued \"a non-punitive punishment meant to save face while protecting the [IOC\u2019s] and Russia\u2019s commercial and political interests\". He also emphasized that Russian whistleblowers provided empirical evidence that \"99 per cent of [their] national-level teammates were doping.\" According to Robertson, \"[WADA] has discovered that when a Russian athlete [reaches] the national level, he or she [has] no choice in the matter: [it is] either dope, or you\u2019re done\"; he added \"There is currently no intelligence I have seen or heard about that indicates the state-sponsored doping program has ceased.\"\nIt was also reported that Russian officials intensively lobbied U.S. politicians in an apparent attempt to achieve the extradition to Russia of the main whistleblower, Grigory Rodchenkov.On 6 December 2017 Vladimir Putin announced his decision \"not to prevent individual Russian athletes\" from participating at the 2018 Winter Games.  He also stated that he is pleased the IOC Inquiry Commission chaired by Samuel Schmid \"didn't find any proof that the Russian government was involved in a doping conspiracy\". However, the Inquiry Commission only said that there's not enough evidence to claim that highest Russian state authorities were involved. The fact that Russian Ministry of Sport and Federal Security Service were part of the scheme was never in doubt.Deputy (member) of the Russian State Duma and former professional boxer Nikolai Valuev has said that Russia should go to the Olympics and \"tear everyone apart to spite these bastards who want to kill our sport\".Despite the \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) designation, many Russian fans still attended the 2018 Games, wearing the Russian colours and chanting \"Russia!\" in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban.Justin Peters of Slate magazine wrote during the Games that the IOC \"ended up with a situation that seemed to negate the entire point of the sanctions against Russia. The IOC did not want there to be a Russian Olympic team at the Pyeongchang Games\u2026 [yet] arenas are full of teams of Russian Olympians\u2026 [this is] a half-hearted wrist slap issued by an entity that appears more interested in saving face than in protecting athletes\".The CAS decision to overturn the life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals met fierce criticism among Olympic officials, including IOC president Thomas Bach who described the decision as \"extremely disappointing and surprising\". Grigory Rodchenkov's lawyer has stated that \"the CAS decision would allow doped athletes to escape without punishment\" and also that \"[the CAS decision] provides yet another ill-gotten gain for the corrupt Russian doping system generally, and Putin specifically\".\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nWADA publishes annual summaries of anti-doping rule violations (ADRV). Russia ranked first in the world for ADRVs during 2013, 2014, and 2015.\n\n\n=== Stripped Olympic medals ===\n\nDue to doping violations, Russia has been stripped of 43 Olympic medals \u2013 the most of any country, four times the number of the runner-up, and more than a third of the global total. It was the leading country in terms of the number of medals removed due to doping at the 2002 Winter Olympics (5 medals), the 2006 Winter Olympics (1 medal), the 2008 Summer Olympics (14 medals), the 2012 Summer Olympics (13 medals), 2014 Winter Olympics (4 medals) and the joint most at the 2004 Summer Olympics (3 medals) and the 2016 Summer Olympics (1 medal). The 43 revoked medals include 11 Golds, 21 Silvers, and 11 Bronzes.\n\n\n== Hashtag controversy ==\n\nAccording to Reuters, Russian trolls were involved in spreading Twitter hashtag #NoRussiaNoGames following the announcement from IOC that Russia is suspended from the 2018 Winter Olympics. One of the accounts identified by Reuters as driving activity around #NoRussiaNoGames was @ungestum, which lists its location as the Russian city of Orenburg. The account has sent 238 tweets consisting of just the hashtag to other users since the ban was announced, indicating that these were computer-generated. The campaign was also highly promoted by a group of at least five accounts which tweeted the hashtag numerous times along with the links that were not related to Russian-language news articles, and repeatedly reposted tweets from each other. One of those accounts, @03_ppm, has sent at least 275 such tweets.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDoping in sport\nDoping at the Olympics\nList of stripped Olympic medals\nIcarus\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRussian Athletes Disappear From Competition After Doping Agency Arrives The Moscow Times, 2018",

          "This place is OK overall but definitely not worth the money. Most of the rooms are blocked off with gates so you cannot take nice pictures.

          "I was so excited to go in but felt bad was so fast I was what it's done. And covered with security guards in each room.  paying 12$ too much. 3$ is enough to be. Sry but I wasn't satisfied with the upside down house",
          "Cool and interesting installation but definitely not worth the $10 entry as it's much too small (4 rooms and you can't even walk in some sections). If it was bigger with more to see then it may be worth it.",
          "Good for a laugh, and fun for the little ones.",
          "Underwhelming . In and out in less than 10 minutes",
          "We went today at 4:50pm to visit the upside down house. The ticket sales attendant said that they are closing in 5 minutes and refused to sell us tickets. The kids were very disappointed. The tour won\u2019t take more than 5 mins! Seriously disappointed.",
          "Don't waste your time.  Go spend your money on some other Clifton Hill tourist trap entertainment.  Takes less than 5 minutes to get thru.  Should be charging a buck instead of ten.",
          "It's fun seeing everything hanging around but I wish it was more interactive.",
          "Not much to do but walk around and get dizzy looking at everything, but the kids loved it!",
          "Not worth the entrance fee. Takes a few minutes to walk through. Nothing to really look at. Looks better from the outside than the inside.",
          "OMG never done anything like that in my life! It is quite the sight to see. Also makes you feel fully dissoriented. They warn you before hand but dang, I was grasping the walls the whole way through. Definitely will go again.",
          "Only one upside down house in the world\nUnique experience...",
          "Entrance is affordable and good customer service",

          "$12 for 12 steps, not worth the price.",
          "It is fun and cool. But very small. You can finish visiting this upside down house in less than 5 minutes. There could be more stuff installed inside the house.",
          "I had higher expectations, and somewhat disappointed in the end. It is nothing more than a handful of rooms upside down. The price for the admission is high for only what is a 3-5 minute walk through.",
          "It's trip and worth doing  but It's a few minutes walk only and about $10 a person",
          "Very cool and fun experience.",
          "Such a waste of money. I've always wanted to see the inside so I finally spent the money and went in last night. The house itself made me feel sick as it's all lop sided and makes you feel like you're falling into the middle. This was not a \u2026",
          "So overpriced! My 6 year old was really excited for this but it was a huge disappointment for all of us. Took us about 6 minutes to walk through and we were intentionally trying to take our time. Nothing interactive at all and the bars \u2026",
          "I enjoyed it. It's a quick tour through the 5 rooms. I think it should be less to get in because you're only in there for about 15 to 20 minutes.",
          "Pretty disappointing place. \nFor the price I expected something bigger and more exciting. \nIt took us less than 5 mins to go throughout the whole house. \nThere is not story behind it just a house upside down. It would have been nice if they \u2026",
          "The fees are exaggerated, so we only sent the kids to visit it. They were outside in about 5 minutes. They said they had fun, but it lasted really too short.",
          "This was a slightly neat, but very fast experience. I think a family of 4 should be able to complete this for under $25. This would not be a recommended place based on the price vs. experience.",
          "It's a pretty cool place. I felt lil dizzy in the house..but it's very small for the price we spent",
          "Made us sick and was pricey for the short walk through .",
          "Save your money. It looks cool from the outside but the inside is boring. All modern stuff inside and it took 2 min to walk through.",
          "It was ok place had few room closed",
          "Look at it from the outside and walk away.  My kid really wanted to walk through it, but they wouldn't let him go without an adult.  Then they charge the adult to basically take a minute and a half to walk through the stupid thing.  Maybe \u2026",
          "A unique thing to see. It worth a visit. Its not even expansive. Ticket it just $12.",
          "Amazing experience. Must-visit mark.",
          "So nice place i feel like home haha",
          "This is a brutal tourist trap. Overpriced, maybe 3 minutes of \"fun\".  Ikea furniture strapped to the ceiling, while you walk on a crooked floor. Save your money and take a picture from the outside, then carry on with one of the other things to do in Niagara.",
          "Upside Down House is quite small but was really a great idea.",
          "Interesting place to visit in Niagara, not only for kids but for adults too.. everything is upside down !!",
          "Pretty cool but overall it's just aight",
          "my daughter loves this place",
          "Something to look at but only once. There are only 4 rooms.. could be made bigger for the fee",
          "Fun place to visit.  Floors are slanted to mimic the ceiling of the house.  Its only takes a few minutes to walk through.  The fun part was feeling off balance and dizzy walking through.  We went thorough w a group of girls and they felt it \u2026",
          "I loved this house.\nWorth seeing.\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c",

          "Interesting, but very small inside.",
          "Unik house and great spot for take photos",
          "Very cool, well done and maintained. It definitely throws your balance off as the perceptions are skewed. It's small but covers all the rooms in a house.",
          "It\u2019s not worth the money! It was cool to see but I honestly think it could be cheaper. I would try some other activities than this.",
          "This was a quick tour but funny. Looking up and walking on a slant = dizzy.",
          "Waste of money as it says it's an upside down house plays tricks on your mind. Nothing great",
          "Meh, overrated tourist attraction. There's better upside down houses out there.",
          "Great small attrition to go to in Niagara Falls. Can not stay inside for too long because of the displacement although there is no time limit.",
          "Dont waste your money. Takes 2 minutes to walk through and you see a boring house upside down.",
          "It was a cool experience but it made me dizzy lol",
          "Not worth the money. Done in under 7 minutes. Just made us all feel nauseous.",
          "Over Priced! A 10 minutes quick tour inside cost over $40 for a family of 4. Will not recommend.",
          "It was a gas I tell you but be careful,  it messes with your equilibrium.",
          "5min for 40 bucks. It's just a tilted upside down house. Very boring, worst experience ever.",
          "Super quick, over priced and nauseating since the floors are uneven",
          "It's a wonderful sight to see everyone upside down.",
          "If you easily get dizzy or nauseous, take my word and don't go here. Also, for 10$+ it's not worth it since you can finish looking at the house in under 5 minutes. You can make it longer if you just want to stand there and takes hundreds of \u2026",
          "Total waste of money 18$ for 2 people (in the off season), I am a pretty optimistic person and enjoys the little things but it literally wasn\u2019t even cool at all... all it did was give me a head ache, it was dirty and lasts only about 3 minutes MAX",
          "It was really fun to see every day things upside down, it was even better to see the TV on and the phone ringing. You will feel dizzy and walk like you're drunk lol but, it's okay. They paid attention to detail. The price was a bit much for just walking thru and looking. But, it's fun. I liked it.",
          "It was different to see",
          "The upside down house was a fun and neat idea has a few rooms to see but it is very small if you take your time your done in under 10min ( but there is no time limit). The girl at the ticket window was polite and friendly although it cost a \u2026",
          "I never got to view this as it says it's open on Monday at 9am on website but it's not. It's 11:17. I'm so disappointed. Went there last night and sign said be back in 5 minutes so decided to do it today and now we are leaving to head home 2500-3000 km away from home",
          "Fun to try at least once. Took some pics where I pretended to squat like Spider-man taking a dump, so that I could rotate the pics upside-down later and look like I poo'd on myself ;)  Do as the Canadians say \"Check it oot, eh?\" or \"Top 'a' da mornin' to yah mate\"",
          "Fun fun .. had a blast and got some interesting pictures.",
          "This place was really cool, but the price was a little high for what it was. I'm glad we went though.",

          "Beautiful decor, friendly staff and great prices :)",
          "$50.00 for a family of 4 to walk through took 2min what a rip off",
          "I say don't waste your money on this. It takes about 2 minutes to walk through.  And literally what you see in the pictures is all you get. It does make you feel dizzy as well so if you have a weak stomach steer clear of this one. Plus most of  the rooms are blocked off so you cannot even go into them. Not worth the money for sure",
          "Part of the Wacky and fun stuff to see and do while visiting Niagara Falls.",
          "Great place to have fun and spend some good time.",
          "Just a phenomenon! Got there too late, but going down again next week with guests from Australia, we will go inside as well",
          "Never even went inside",

          "Amazing my children enjoyed there",
          "Nice but quite short visit. Didn't like they have put bars to restrict people. Over all fun. I recommend places owner to advice how best tourist can take photos as it's not a common place for someone to visit daily and have photo sense",
          "Kinda cool but not worth $12.50 pp",
          "It's pretty cool, and your probably not going to see it anywhere else but it is a little pricey. Just like everything else in the tourist area of Niagra Falls.",
          "Very disappointed about this attraction. Very short and quite honestly not worth the entry cost. The experience does offer some interesting aspects but that does not outweigh how short the visit is. Most of the satisfaction I got was frankly from the exterior viewing of the home. I suggest walking by and seeing it that way.",
          "Makes you sea sick even sober, lol!!!",
          "The grandkids loved this attraction.",
          "Was fun. Looking up at see all the stuff on the ceiling.",

          "Extremely over priced. Definitely not worth the money.",

          "Despite getting dizziness when entering the house, this place is a piece of art!",
          "The upside down house was a little expensive for the time it took to go through the whole house. It was $10 plus tax per person and it takes about 3 minutes to walk through if you take your time. It was a cool concept and fun while it lasts \u2026",
          "I went there with my husband and 3 years daughter. The place is very small and we finished only 5mins but it\u2019s fun for kids. We payed $24 (3years free) if you want to save money, one parent is enough for this place.",
          "Wow.. I'm from niagara falls so I expect the tourist attractions to be disappointing, but this one is the most pointless racket I've seen.",
          "Very cute attraction BUT extremely short and way too expensive for what you get.  I would have been much happier if it was longer.   Just an FYI the set up made me feel very dizzy, which I'm assuming is part of the experience but if you \u2026",
          "I enjoyed my visit and it was worthy of straying a bit longer and appreciate the nice idea of the creators. I would recommend this place and it's a fun place to be if you love creative places to look. It's short, but worthy of a memory.",
          "Neat shopping.. Love it",
          "Very cool place. If you suffer from vertigo it can be hard to walk through the house.",
          "Unique experience. You get to walk inside a house turned upside down. The house is not that big, there are only 6 rooms. I deducted a star because it's very short to walk through it. It's not always busy so you could take your time and take \u2026",
          "Overpriced, and a little disappointed, the house was pretty cool but I got a little dizzy while walking through the house",
          "Kids love it!",
          "It's just a cool, fun attraction.",
          "Pretty cool house in the Clifton Hill section but too expensive for what it is. It's really just a place to take cool photos in. We thought it would be bigger but it's quite small and not worth the price for a family of 4.",
          "Quick to go through but very interesting",
          "Damn good",
          "Beautiful place",
          "Should be called house of suckers. The place is so small and for the amount you have to fork over is insane. Just under $50 for 2 adults and 2 kids. Wife was in line and I was waiting across the street shopping and she came back saying the \u2026",
          "Way overpriced tourist trap rip off.",
          "Such a fun house!",
          "Great attraction. Must see",
          "It is very neat but the exhibit is short.  You will find that it is hard to walk around and keep your balance.  Take lots of pictures.",
          "Interesting place to visit",
          "We had a great time taking gravity defying pictures or hanging from the ceiling.  We had the house to ourselves when we went, but on a crowded summer's day it would be hard to get some good shots.  It takes a bit of practice to get things looking just right, so don't rush.  Then flip your photos around afterwards for some fun results.",
          "Cool but such a rip off.",
          "Interesting to look at, but for the price, it's a tourist trap.  Save your money unless you're really into taking different pictures.",
          "weird little place.. but lots of fun",
          "Overpriced, walkthrough the entire house in less than 8 min.",
          "Looks great from outside. It looked awesome going in. But it was just that, a view of an upside down house. It took use less than 10mins to see the whole thing. It was fun but short.",
          "A short little art piece. The rooms inside are very cleverly designed with very little out of place (like the smoke detectors for safety). It's good for an amusing look into life upside down. The answering machine recording that plays is a nice touch.",
          "Very interesting attraction.",
          "Better from outside!",
          "Really weird feeling when you walk in, you get really dizzy. I would suggest it if you have stomach problems, or if you were drinking. For 10 dollars I feel like it wasn't worth it, if it was 5 dollars to get in, I would give the upside down house 5 stars.",
          "It's alright, could be interesting if you just want to see inside",
          "Fun place to walk around",
          "Didn\u2019t go inside but made for a fun video opportunity!",
          "It's fascinating to go through and look at. But its pricey and not that long of a tour at all. Walk very slowly to enjoy the attraction for as long as you can before you leave the exit. ",
          "Be prepared for an Upside-down experience. The house is located off of Clifton Hill (Burger King).\n\nKids are $7.99 and adults are $8.99. It is a quick walk through depending on how your body feels with seeing furniture above you.\n\nNote: if \u2026",
          "Definitely a great experience",
          "Fun place but very small, wish there were guidelines on how to get the best pictures, felt a bit dizzy walking in the house",
          "The house is well done but the experience isn't worth the cost at all.",
          "It really feels like you are upside down. Your head is lightly spinning trying to understand what is going on. Fun place. You will like it))",
          "My grandson and I had been really looking forward to visiting this unique building while in Niagara Falls.   Sadly we were disappointed at just how short it takes to walk through it.  Three of us took all of 8 minutes and it cost us $32.00.   It is ok inside, but we expected more. It is not worth the price of admission.",
          "Worst attraction in Niagara Falls. Waste of money $42 for 2 adults and 2 kids....it was over after 2 minutes. My 9 year old daughter was saying \"What a rip-off\" as we were exiting the place...enough said.",
          "I personally loved it! It's really cool in every way and fun, kids will love it for sure. A little disorienting, but don't worry you won't fall or do anything embarrassing unless you're actually trying to! Just a little pricey considering the length, but isn't everything around here? I definitely recommend this for our next visit!",
          "Funny, cool for kids only. Nothing much to see. Very small (dont expect to see much stuff there).",
          "Complete rip off.  Looks cooler from the outside for free.  Should be about $2 to go in.  $42 for 4 people is absolutely ridiculous.  Do not waste your time on this garbage.",
          "If you like to get back at your mind playing tricks on you, but don't know how. Now you can play tricks to your mind by going here.  But be careful, it can be very trippy and fun. I recommend going in a group. Fun and laughter will ensue. ",
          "Every thing is upside down inside.You can take crazy looking upside down pictures showing you hanging upside down from ceiling.",
          "Pretty cool! We thought it was expensive to walk through a silly house, but were surprised at how it throws off your balance. Almost makes you a bit motion sick, we got a good laugh at the unexpected dizziness.",
          "Those with motion sickness should be careful. The house is cool but disorienting",
          "Didn\u2019t venture into the pace due to the small sizing and it being closed, however the place is definitely a cool tourist attraction and a must visit place!",
          "It was fun walking through the upside down house. I loved it .",
          "Great place to visit",
          "Too expensive for cheap thrills that took less than 15 minutes for us to get through. It was filled with old cheap furnitures that you can't even touch as you were barred by a rope to even get close to anything. Steer clear and use your money else where.",
          "Worth seeing, looks super cool!",
          "Nice idea",
          "Staff were friendly, even charged me at kids rates ($6). Something different to see, good photo op if on holidays. A bit dizzying, but if you have some extra time it's good for a laugh. ",
          "Kind of Unique.",
          "I personally didn't step inside but I asked how much it was because the kids wanted to check it out, after tax $10 each.. $40 to take the kids in for a couple min? No thanks huge rip off. ",
          "Not really worth going inside unless you want to take pics of the upside down interior.",
          "You have to go in to believe how amazing this is",
          "Different",
          "A lot of money for a such a small attraction. Took about 2 minutes.",
          "I was surprised by and enjoyed the disorienting effect produced by walking through the house, very cool. I went later at night so it was not very busy, I think having lots of people walking through would have hampered my enjoyment of it. I \u2026",

          "Amazing Architecture..",
          "Nice but 10$ is expansive for 5 minutes",

          "Go in here its fun",
          "Just a place for 2 pictures.",
          "Interesting concept but not worth the price to go in to see furniture stuck to the ceiling and literally walk through in less then 10 minutes",
          "Very neat!",
          "It was such a rip off and instant SEVERE nausea for half of our group. It was terrible.",
          "Way overpriced, but still something really cool to do! Extremely short so be sure not to run thru and not enjoy it! There's just something about all the little details that are simply... Upside-down haha",
          "Super fun but it's just five upside down rooms and a rather high price for the 10-15 minutes you spend viewing them.",
          "Good place for kids.  I was bored after the first 2 mins.",
          "if you don\u2019t mind paying $10 for a 30 second tour this is right for you. i got bored within minutes. one of the worst attractions in niagara falls",

          "It was done great!!",
          "overpriced for a 5min walk through.",
          "It\u2019s cool but the ticket is overpriced.",
          "for the kids... takes 5 minutes to go through. overpriced for sure.  great photo ops tho",
          "it's good",
          "It was a bit expensive for the experience. I wouldn't waste my time. You can't go into the actual space where things are upside down, so that's a bummer. It's like five small rooms and then your done. It took two minutes.",
          "It's nice but the ticket is expensive for the time you will be spending inside",

          "It is lovely",
          "The 2 minute walk through house was a fun experience. Not for $8 dollars though. The house could have been a bit more clean and polished as there were spills all over the floor and cracks in the paint.",
          "Very fun place to visit!\nBe sure to listen to the messages on the answering machine before you exit - #LittleMan and I couldn't stop laughing!\nTake pictures and look at them upside down and you'll see what a great job they did at designing \u2026",

          "A fantastic experience for the whole family! The upside down house is quirky, zany, an great for kids.",

          "It is as the title suggest an upside down house",
          "A strange experience, kids friendly, watch your steps!",
          "The kids were completely disappointed when they came out.  It literally took them maximum 5 minutes to get through.  It's deceiving from the outside because it looks quite big, but it's just one floor and not all that big.  Cost for 1 adult and 2 children = $28.  Go spend it elsewhere.",
          "There was some sort of gravitational force which immazed and surprised me. It was fun though.",
          "Amazing attraction but not worth the $8 for what takes under 2minutes to walk through...",
          "Complete waste of money",
          "Brilliant, you'll know how it feels when your world goes upside down!",
          "Neat but overpriced.",
          "It is a beautiful house and its upside down so  cool.",

        "wiki": "Sochi (Russian: \u0421\u043e\u0301\u0447\u0438, IPA: [\u02c8sot\u0255\u026a] (listen)) is a city in Krasnodar Krai. It is located in Western Russia, on the Black Sea coast near Russia's southern border. The Greater Sochi area, which includes territories and localities subordinated to Sochi proper, has a total area of 3,526 square kilometers (1,361 sq mi) and sprawls for 145 kilometers (90 mi) along the shores of the Black Sea near the Caucasus Mountains. The area of the city proper is 176.77 square kilometers (68.25 sq mi). According to the 2010 Census, the city had a permanent population of 343,334, up from 328,809 recorded in the 2002 Census, making it Russia's largest resort city. Being part of the Caucasian Riviera, it is one of the very few places in Russia with a subtropical climate, with warm to hot summers and mild winters.\nWith the alpine and Nordic events held at the nearby ski resort of Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi hosted the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, as well as the Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix from 2014 until at least 2020. It was also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore the whole area was conquered by Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian invaders, the Zygii people lived in Lesser Abkhazia under the Kingdom of Pontus, then the Roman Empire's influence in antiquity. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of Lazica and Abkhazia, who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was unified under the single Georgian monarchy in 11th-century, forming one of the Saeristavo, known as Tskhumi extending its possessions up to Nicopsis. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading Alans, Khazars, Mongols and other nomadic empires whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century Byzantine basilica still stands in the Loo Microdistrict.From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi known as Ubykhia was part of historical Circassia, and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, which was their principal trading partner in the Muslim world.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nThe coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Caucasian War and the Russo-Turkish War, 1828\u20131829; however, the Circassians did not admit the Russian control over Circassia and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the Circassian coast (Adyghe: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044b \u0430\u0443\u0448\u0443). Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the Russian Empire and the British Empire that occurred in 1836 over the mission of the Vixen.The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron Feodor Tornau investigated the coastal route from Gelendzhik to Gagra, and across the mountains to Kabarda, in the 1830s. In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the Sochi River as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky in order to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on Cape Adler soon after.\nThe last battle of the Caucasian War took place at the Godlikh river on March 18, 1864 O.S., where the Ubykhs were defeated by the Dakhovsky regiment of the Russian Army. On March 25, 1864, the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of Caucasian War was proclaimed at Kbaade tract (modern Krasnaya Polyana) on June 2 (21 May O.S.), 1864, by the manifesto of Emperor Alexander II read aloud by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia.After the end of Caucasian War (during the period of 1864\u20131870) almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the Shapsugs, who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed in the Circassian Genocide or expelled to the Ottoman Empire (see Circassian Genocide). Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia.In 1874\u20131891, the first Russian Orthodox church, St. Michael's Church, was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed Dakhovsky Posad on April 13, 1874 (O.S.). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky Posad was renamed Sochi Posad (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed Black Sea Governorate. In 1900\u20131910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, \"Kavkazskaya Riviera\", opened on June 14, 1909 (O.S.). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Soviet time ===\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the littoral area saw sporadic armed clashes involving the Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev's Constructivist Institute of Rheumatology (1927\u20131931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Modern Russia ===\nFollowing Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimean Peninsula (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a Greater Sochi which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGreater Sochi is elongated along the Black Sea coast for 145 kilometers (90 mi). Sochi is approximately 1,603 kilometers (996 mi) from Moscow.The city of Sochi borders with Tuapsinsky District in the northwest, with Apsheronsky District and with Maykopsky District of the Republic of Adygea in the north, with Mostovsky District in the northeast, and with Georgia/Abkhazia in the southeast. From the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea.\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are Lazarevskoye, Loo, Dagomys, central Sochi (Tsentralny City District), Khosta, Matsesta, and Adler. The whole city is located on the slopes of the Western Caucasus which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the Mzymta, which is in fact the longest Black Sea tributary in Russia, and the Shakhe. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the Sochi, the Khosta, and the Matsesta. The Psou River makes the border with Abkhazia.\nThe northeastern part of the city belongs to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve which is a World Heritage Site spanning vast areas in Krasnodar Krai and Adygea. Almost the whole area of the Greater Sochi, with the exception of the coast and of the area which belong to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, are included into Sochi National Park.\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters (average 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from December to March and warm summers (average 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) during the day and 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from May to October.\n\n\n=== Layout and landmarks ===\nSochi is unique among larger Russian cities as having some aspects of a subtropical resort. Apart from the scenic Caucasus Mountains, pebble and sand beaches, the city attracts vacation-goers with its subtropical vegetation, numerous parks, monuments, and extravagant Stalinist architecture. About two million people visit Greater Sochi each summer, when the city is home to the annual film festival \"Kinotavr\" and a getaway for Russia's elite.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 2,957 square kilometers (731,000 acres) Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, lies just north from the city. Sochi also has the region's most northerly tea plantations.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), at the lower elevations. Its average annual temperature is 18.4 \u00b0C (65.1 \u00b0F) during the day and 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) at night. In the coldest months\u2014January and February\u2014the average temperature is about 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) during the day, above 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). In the warmest months\u2014July and August\u2014the temperature typically ranges from 25 to 29 \u00b0C (77 to 84 \u00b0F) during the day, about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 23\u201324 \u00b0C (73\u201375 \u00b0F). Yearly sunshine hours are around 2,200. Generally, the summer season lasts four months, from June to September. Two months\u2014April and November\u2014are transitional; sometimes temperatures reach 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with an average temperature of around 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) during the day and 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at night. December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperature (of these four months) 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night. Average annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters (67 in). Sochi lies at 8b/9a hardiness zone, so the city supports different types of palm trees. Sochi is situated on the same latitude as Nice but strong cold winds from Asia make winters less warm. In fact, temperatures drop below freezing every winter. The highest temperature recorded was 39.4 \u00b0C (102.9 \u00b0F), on July 30, 2000, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221213.4 \u00b0C (7.9 \u00b0F) on January 25, 1892.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status and city divisions ==\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Krasnaya Polyana) and seventy-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Sochi\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Sochi is incorporated as Sochi Urban Okrug.Sochi is administratively subdivided into four city districts: Tsentralny City District, Lazarevsky City District, Khostinsky City District, and Adlersky City District. Tsentralny City District, comprising the central portion of, is by far the smallest out of four in terms of the area, and the other three have comparable areas, with Lazarevsky City District being the biggest. In terms of the population, Tsentralny City District is approximately twice as big as each of the other three city districts.\n\n\n=== Tsentralny City District ===\n\nTsentralny City District, or central Sochi, covers an area of 32 square kilometers (12 sq mi) and, as of the 2010 Census, has a population of 137,677. The highlights include:\n\nMichael Archangel Cathedral, a diminutive church built in 1873\u20131891 to Kaminsky's designs in order to commemorate the victorious conclusion of the Caucasian War.\nThe red-granite Archangel Column, erected in 2006 in memory of the Russian soldiers fallen in Sochi during the Caucasian War. It is capped by a 7-metre bronze statue of Sochi's patron saint, Michael the Archangel.\nSochi Art Museum occupies a large building with a four-columned portico, completed in 1939. The Neoclassical design is by Ivan Zholtovsky.\nSochi Arboretum, a large botanical garden with tropical trees from many countries, and the Mayors Alle\u00e9\u2014a landscape avenue of palm trees planted by mayors from cities around the world.\nThe Tree of Friendship, a hybrid citrus tree planted in 1934 in the Subtropical Botanic Garden. Since 1940 numerous citrus cultivars from foreign countries have been grafted onto this tree as a token of friendship and peace. The associated Friendship Tree Garden Museum has a collection of 20,000 commemorative presents from around the world.\nThe Winter Theater (1934\u20131937) is another rigorously Neoclassical edifice, surrounded by 88 Corinthian columns, with a pediment bearing the statues of Terpsichore, Melpomene and Thalia, all three cast by Vera Mukhina.\nHall of Organ and Chamber Music. Located centrally in the city of Sochi it conducts organ, symphony, chamber-ensemble, choral, vocal music concerts. All year round the Sochi Symphony Orchestra, local actors of the city art groups, famous Russian and international performers, International Contests Winners and Laureates give concerts here.\nThe Maritime Passenger Terminal (1955) is notable for its distinctive 71-meter-high steepled tower and four statues symbolizing the cardinal points.\nThe Railway Station (1952) is one of the most remarkable buildings of Sochi.\nThe Riviera Park was established by Vasily Alexeyevich Khludov in 1883 in the part of the city which later became known as Khludovskaya. The park is popular with tourists and local residents alike. It has a variety of attractions, including an outcrop of funny statues and a \"glade of friendship\" where magnolia trees were planted by every Soviet cosmonaut, among other notables.\n\n\n=== Lazarevsky City District ===\n\nLazarevsky City District lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people. It is the largest city district by area, covering some 1,744 square kilometers (673 sq mi) and comprising several microdistricts:\n\nLazarevskoye, 59 km (37 mi) from the city center, contains a delphinarium, an old church (1903), and a new church (1999). The settlement was founded as a Russian military outpost in 1839 and was named after Admiral Mikhail Lazarev.\nLoo, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, was once owned by Princes Loov, a noble Abkhazian family. The district contains the ruins of a medieval church, founded in the 8th century, rebuilt in the 11th century, and converted into a fortress in the Late Middle Ages.\nDagomys, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, has been noted for its botanical garden, established by order of Nicholas II, as well as tea plantations and factories. A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins Bocharov Ruchey, a dacha built for Kliment Voroshilov in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the President of Russia, where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.\nGolovinka is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the Ubykhs and the Shapsugs, the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the Subashi landing of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted Decembrists used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the Crimean War, so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.\nFort Godlik, of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the Khazars and revived by the Genoese in the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Khostinsky City District ===\n\nKhostinsky City District, sprawling to the southeast from the city center, occupies approximately 374 square kilometers (144 sq mi), with a population of 65,229 as of the 2010 Census. The district is traversed by many rivulets which give their names to the microdistricts of Matsesta (\"flame-colored river\"), Kudepsta, and Khosta (\"the river of boars\").\n\n\n=== Adlersky City District ===\n\nAdlersky City District, with an area of 1,352 square kilometers (522 sq mi) and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census, is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient Sadz village and a medieval Genoese trading post.\nAmong the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation from about 30,000 years ago. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages (auls), the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nAlso located here are the largest trout fishery in Russia (founded in 1964) and a breeding nursery for great apes.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%).\nThe city is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi's Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey's northeastern Black Sea coast who came in the late 19th century and on. The rest are Armenians from Georgia (particularly from Abkhazia and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Armenia (especially from Shirak Province due to the 1988 earthquake).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Sochi region in the Middle Ages. The region was relatively isolated before 1829. In the North, a few hundred Sunni Muslim Shapsugs, a part of the Circassian nation, lived around Tkhagapsh, near Lazarevskoye. The Circassians (also known as Adyghe) converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread to the region.Currently, Sochi is a large predominantly Christian city, though there are thought to be around 20,000 Muslims (5% of inhabitants) living there now (the majority are Adyghe) plus other Eastern Caucasians, Turks, Tatars, and other smaller Muslim groups.A mosque was built in 2008 by United Arab Emirates in the central area of Bytkha, in addition to the old mosque being around 40 km (25 miles) north of the city center in the Adyghe aul of Tkhagapsh.\nThere are around thirty Russian Orthodox churches, the largest being St. Michael's, and two monasteries, plus two Catholic churches, one in the center of Sochi and the other in Lazarevskoye. The Armenian community, which is important in Sochi, gathers in about ten churches.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSochi is home to the following high educational institutions (masters level degree and PhD):  Sochi State University, Russian International Innovative University, and Russian International Olympic University.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\nSochi is also known for its sport facilities: a local tennis school spawned the careers of such notable players as Grand Slam champions Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Kafelnikov spent much of his childhood here, while Sharapova relocated to Florida at the age of seven). In late 2005, the Russian Football Union announced that it was planning to establish a year-round training center for the country's national teams in Sochi. The city's warm climate was cited as one of the main incentives. Sochi is also the home for the football team PFC Sochi which plays in the Russian Premier League and for the ice hockey team HC Sochi which plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\n\n=== 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===\n\nThe nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor at Krasnaya Polyana was the location of the alpine and Nordic events for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nIn June 2006, the International Olympic Committee announced that Sochi had been selected as a finalist city to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On July 4, 2007, Sochi was announced as the host city of the 2014 Winter Games, edging out Pyeongchang, South Korea and Salzburg, Austria.This was Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The site of a training centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi saw concern and controversy following a new federal law approved in Russia in June 2013 that bans \"homosexual propaganda to minors\". There were also concerns over Islamist militants.\n\n\n==== Construction work ====\n\nThe state-controlled RAO UES announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30 billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014. The power generating companies Inter RAO UES and RusHydro would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants\u2014and the federal grid company FGC UES has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW\u2014of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. \"The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6 billion rubles (about US $3.26 billion), of which 50 billion rubles (about US$2 billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid,\" the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8 billion rubles (about US$1.9 billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38 billion roubles (about US$1.48 billion) of that.\n\n\n=== Other sports events ===\n\nThe Silk Way Rally which is part of Dakar series took place in Sochi in 2010 for the last stage between the capital of the Republic of Adygea Maykop to the city of Sochi through Pseshwap.President Vladimir Putin reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone for the city to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix from 2014.The World Robot Olympiad took place in the Adler Arena Skating Center on November 21\u201323, 2014.\nThe 2014 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen was played in Sochi in November 2014, with Carlsen emerging as the winner.\nThe Fisht Olympic Stadium was also used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches.\nSince 2014, the city has hosted HC Sochi, who play at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in the Kontinental Hockey League, the biggest ice hockey league in Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nPublic transport is represented mainly by bus and taxi. Sochi is served by the Adler-Sochi International Airport. Types of non-mass public transport include two funiculars (at the Central military sanatorium and Ordzhonikidze resort) and three cable cars (at arboretum sanatorium \"Dawn\" and pension \"Neva\") also has several cableways in Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe Sochi Port terminal building was built in 1955 by Karo Alabyan and Leonid Karlik in Stalinist architecture. It is topped with a 71-meter steepled tower. Sculptures embodying seasons and cardinal points are set above the tower's three tiers.\nFive of the railway stations of Sochi were renovated for the 2014 Winter Olympics. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta and Khosta railway stations. In Adler city district of Sochi, the original railway station was preserved and new railway station was built near it.

        "wiki": "There were many controversies and concerns affecting the 2014 Winter Olympics. There were disputes with Circassians, who demanded the events be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for the 19th century Circassian genocide, environmental and economic issues, lack of political stability and governance, and the safety and human rights of LGBT athletes and journalists, in light of Russia's \"gay propaganda\" laws, which sparked Olympic-focused protests. However, all of these events were overshadowed by the massive Russian state-sponsored doping program uncovered in the aftermath of the Games.\n\n\n== Human rights ==\n\nOn 30 January 2014, nine Amnesty International European directors delivered a petition in Moscow to the offices of Russian President Vladimir Putin calling on him to repeal a series of laws restricting the right to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of association in the run up to the 2014 Winter Olympics. The organization felt that the laws were no substitute for an effective justice system, and demanded the Russian authorities to release immediately and unconditionally all prisoners of conscience (POCs). The Russian parliament passed an amnesty bill that freed the imprisoned Pussy Riot singers, the foreign activists amongst Greenpeace's \"Arctic 30\" and the 2012 Bolotnaya Square protest.Human Rights Watch has repeatedly presented the IOC detailed evidence of documented human rights abuses linked to Russia's preparations for the 2014 Winter Games since 2009. Human Rights Watch have documented exploitation of migrant workers in violation of Russian law; evictions of residents without fair compensation and in some cases, with no compensation at all. Many resettled residents lost a portion of their livelihoods; Threats, harassment, and lawsuits of activists and journalists critical of the Games, as well as Russia's discriminatory anti-LGBT propaganda law. Not before late 2013 the Russian government and IOC covered $8.34 million in wage arrears.Both German president Joachim Gauck and European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Viviane Reding publicly boycotted the Games over human rights abuses, with Reding specifically citing Russia's treatment of minorities.On 21 January 2014 Russian authorities sentenced left activist Vladislav Ryazantsev to 15 days. Ryazantsev is one of the leaders of the Left Front movement. He has been arrested allegedly for swearing at a bus stop late one evening.\nVladislav Ryazantsev and his fellow activists had planned to hold an action under the slogan of boycott of Sochi Olympics.On 5 February 2014 Russian authorities sentenced environmental activist Igor Kharchenko to five days. Kharchenko is member of the Russian NGO Environmental Watch for North Caucasus (Ecologicheskaya Vakhta po Severnomu Kavkazu). He has been arrested and his car was vandalized. Sergei Nikitin, Amnesty International's Moscow Office Director said: \"The Russian authorities must halt their harassment of civil society activists, protect the right to peaceful freedom of expression, and release the Sochi prisoners of conscience: Igor Kharchenko and his fellow environmentalist Yevgeny Vitishko, who is currently serving 15 days in administrative detention on trumped-up charges.\"Evgeny Vitishko was arrested for 15 days in the Sochi area reportedly charged allegedly for swearing at a bus stop. Yevgeniy Vitishko and his fellow activists have been actively involved in protests regarding the deforestation and illegal construction and fencing in areas of protected forest around Sochi. AI is concerned about his unfair trial resulted in a court decision to send him to prison colony for three years.\n\n\n=== Police arrests ===\nTwo members of the punk group Pussy Riot, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina, and a group of activists and journalists were arrested by Russian police in Sochi when simply walking down the street. Pussy Riot members have urged politicians attending the Winter Olympics to criticise human rights abuses in Russia. According to Amnesty International people are being targeted for peacefully speaking their minds. Almost daily there are reports of arrests of activists in Sochi and the Olympic Games area including Semyon Simonov Memorial, David Hakim and journalists from Radio Free Europe and Novaya Gazeta. Amnesty demanded the International Olympic Committee to condemn the arrests.\n\n\n=== LGBT rights ===\nThe rights of LGBT people in Russia were a concern leading up to the Games (where seven openly lesbian and bisexual, athletes, all female, were scheduled to participate). Russia became the subject of international criticism following the signing of a federal law by Vladimir Putin in June 2013, which banned the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors. Mass media classified the legislation as being \"anti-gay\", while LGBT rights activists considered the law to be too broad and vague, characterizing it as an effective ban on promoting LGBT rights and culture. Human Rights Campaign (HRC) president Chad Griffin argued that even kissing a same-sex partner or displaying LGBT symbols such as the rainbow flag could be illegal under the law. The legislation was also attributed to an increase in homophobic violence in Russia by anti-gay and Neo-Nazi groups. Critics also considered the law to be inconsistent with principle six of the Olympic Charter, which states that \"any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement.\" \"\n\n\n==== Assurances ====\nIn August 2013, the IOC stated that it had \"received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games\"; this was contradicted in a statement three days later made by Russia's Ministry of the Interior, which stated that the anti-propaganda laws would still be enforced in Sochi. The IOC also confirmed that it would enforce Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter, which forbids political protest, against athletes who make displays of support for the LGBT community. The IOC received written assurance from the Russian government in August 2013 stating that it was committed to abiding by the Olympic Charter during the Olympic Games. Vladimir Putin also made similar assurances prior to the Games, but warned LGBT attendees to abide by the law. Anatoly Pakhomov, mayor of Sochi, explained to reporters prior to the Games that homosexuality \"was not the custom in the Caucasus\", and claimed that no gays lived in Sochi at all (despite the presence of two gay clubs and evidence of a LGBT community in Sochi on a Russian social network). He went on to say that everyone, including gays, were welcome in Sochi, \"as long as they do not impose their habits on others.\"\n\n\n==== Protests and campaigns ====\nDespite these assurances, Olympic-focused protests and campaigns, such as the Principle 6 campaign (a collaboration between a group of Olympic athletes, the organizations All Out, Athlete Ally, and clothing maker American Apparel), have been held in protest of Russia's anti-gay policies. There were also calls to boycott the Games, drawing comparisons to the Summer Olympics of 1980 in Moscow. However, a writer for the Financial Times felt that such a boycott would be counter-productive, given that there was no boycott of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing despite China's poor human rights record, but suggested that action by Olympic sponsors would be more effective.At January, 2014 Russian leader of the Left Front movement Vladislav Ryazantsev together with like-minded persons opened out an informative campaign against Olympic Games in Sochi. In the social network of VK.com appeared the group \u00abBoycott of Olympic Games-2014 in Sochi\u00bb in which Ryazantsev united with left activist Anton Morvan publishes devastating information about the cost of Olympic Games and scales saw cut at its preparation. In addition, the group collects information about the game shooting of animals in the city-resort. \u2014 The Group \u00abBoycott of Olympic Games-2014 in Sochi\u00bb is one of many private initiatives of left activists. Its purpose is collection and publication of true information about violations, crimes and peculations during the preparation of the Olympic Games, helping to open eyes people\u00bb, \u2014 Vladislav Ryazantsev reported to the journalist of Donnews.ru. \u2014 \u00abIn addition, we call to declare boycott, avoid watching the games and buying commodities with symbolism of Olympic Games\u00bb.A number of world leaders, including United States president Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, declined to attend the Games' Opening Ceremony as delegates for various reasons. Although attending the Winter Olympics has not historically been a priority for world leaders, there was still speculation that their non-attendance was a symbolic boycott of Russian policies. The U.S. appointed tennis player Billie Jean King and women's hockey player Caitlin Cahow, who are both openly gay, as its delegation instead. Although Obama stressed diversity and made no reference to the controversy when announcing the delegation, on 6 February 2014, he confirmed the intent of the choices during an interview with Bob Costas aired by NBC the next day, stating that \"there is no doubt we wanted to make it very clear that we do not abide by discrimination in anything, including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\" Cahow stated that the decision was meant to \"[highlight] Americans who know what it means to have freedoms and liberties under the Constitution. That's really what we're representing in Sochi and it's not at all different from what's espoused in the spirit of Olympism.\"In February 2014, prior to the games, a group of 40 human rights organizations (including Athlete Ally, Freedom House, Human Rights Campaign, Human Rights Watch and Russian LGBT network among others) sent a joint letter to the ten Worldwide Olympic Partner companies, urging them to use their prominence to support the rights of LGBT athletes under the Olympic Charter, and pressure the IOC to show greater scrutiny towards the human rights abuses of future host countries. On 3 February 2014, USOC sponsor AT&T issued a statement in support of LGBT rights at the Games, becoming the first major Olympic advertiser to condemn the laws. Several major non-sponsors also made pro-LGBT statements to coincide with the opening of the Games; Google placed a quotation from the Olympic Charter and an Olympic-themed logo in the colors of the rainbow flag on its home page worldwide, while Channel 4 (who serves as the official British broadcaster of the Paralympics) adopted a rainbow-colored logo and broadcast a \"celebratory\", pro-LGBT advert entitled \"Gay Mountain\" on 7 February 2014, alongside an interview with former rugby union player and anti-homophobia activist Ben Cohen.The Huffington Post noted that the opening ceremony, ironically, featured tributes to \"some of history's most widely acclaimed and definitely gay Russians\", including composer Peter Tchaikovsky (1840-1893), ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky (1889-1950), and patron of arts, and founder of Ballets Russes, Sergei Diaghilev. Russian organizers denied any connection, stating that these figures were selected because of their cultural significance. On the same topic, critics also noted the Russian pop duo t.A.T.u were invited to perform during the opening ceremony; although they are not actually lesbian, the all-female duo were well known for incorporating themes of lesbianism in their music and on-stage personas (live appearances often featured the singers kissing each other), its name is a corruption of a shortened Russian phrase meaning \"this girl loves that girl\", and the duo made a statement in support of LGBT rights in the wake of Yuri Luzhkov's objection to the 2007 Moscow Pride parade. Organizers noted that t.A.T.u were chosen because they were well known to an international audience, denying any relation to LGBT rights.\n\n\n== Doping scandal ==\n\nIn December 2014, German public broadcaster ARD aired a documentary which made wide-ranging allegations that Russia organized a state-run doping program which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. In November 2015, Russia's track and field team was provisionally suspended by the IAAF.In May 2016, The New York Times published allegations by the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games. Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won at Sochi were the result of doping.In December 2016, following the release of the McLaren report on Russian doping at the Sochi Olympics, the International Olympic Committee announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes at the Sochi Olympic Games. La Gazzetta dello Sport reported the names of 17 athletes, of whom 15 are among the 28 under investigation.Three ladies artistic skaters were named as being under investigation. They are Adelina Sotnikova, the singles gold medalist, as well as pairs skaters Tatiana Volosozhar and Ksenia Stolbova. Volosozhar and Stolbova won gold and silver medals, respectively, in pairs skating. Both also won gold medals in the team event, which also puts the other eight team medalists at risk of losing their golds.\nSix skiers were provisionally suspended from competition on the basis of the McLaren report: Evgeniy Belov, Alexander Legkov, Alexey Petukhov, Maxim Vylegzhanin, Yulia Ivanova and Evgenia Shapovalova. Legkov won a gold medal, and Vylegzhanin won three silver medals.\nThe International Biathlon Union provisionally suspended two biathletes who were in the Sochi games: Olga Vilukhina and Yana Romanova, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport. Vilukhina won silver in sprint, and both women were on a relay team that won the silver medal. They both retired after the 2014/2015 season.\nThe International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation provisionally suspended four skeleton sliders. They are among the six athletes on the skeleton team: Nikita Tregubov, Alexander Tretyakov, Sergey Chudinov, Elena Nikitina, Maria Orlova and Olga Potylitsina. Tretyakov won a gold medal, and Nikitina won a silver.\nIt has been speculated that some Russia's Winter Olympians used xenon gas in preparation for the Sochi Games. Using xenon gas is not specifically banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA); however, it could be used for performance enhancement and raises questions about what constitutes doping and practices that should and should not be allowed.\n\n\n== Event judging ==\n\n\n=== Allegations of vote swapping ===\nFrench sports newspaper L'\u00c9quipe, quoting an anonymous Russian coach, alleged that Russia and the United States would swap votes, with the United States voting for Russian athletes in pairs figure skating and team events and Russia voting for the Americans in ice dancing. The allegations were categorically denied by U.S. Figure Skating.\n\n\n=== Men's ice hockey tournament ===\nDuring a men's ice hockey tournament round-robin game between USA and Russia, a Russian goal scored late in the third period, which would have given the team a 3-2 lead, was disallowed after referees ruled that the net was moved when the goal was scored. The decision resulted in the score remaining 2-2. USA went on to win the game in a shootout, which resulted in Russia playing a playoff qualification game while USA received a bye to the quarterfinals. The decision was criticized by many Russian politicians, TV hosts and commentators. Following the game, protesters led by the Kremlin party's youth group held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to protest the decision. In response to the controversy, Konstantin Komissarov, the referee supervisor of International Ice Hockey Federation, officially confirmed that the decision by the referee was correct, citing the appropriate use of video review in assessing the play.\n\n\n=== Ladies' singles figure skating ===\n\nImmediately after the final scores were announced, journalistic questions arose regarding whether 17 year old Russia\u2019s Adelina Sotnikova's performance deserved higher scores than the performances of the 23 year old figure skater South Korea\u2019s Yuna Kim. Questions over the judges, the judging system, and the anonymity of scores were also raised in the press.\n\n\n==== Official responses ====\nOn 21 February 2014, the International Skating Union (ISU) issued a statement which asserted all rules and procedures were applied during the competition and that no official protest had been filed by any participating nation concerning the results of the competition. Such a protest must be done within 30 minutes of the event.ISU's 21 February 2014 statement declaring their confidence \"in the high quality and integrity of the ISU judging system\". Adding \"judges were selected by random drawing from a pool of 13 potential judges\" and all nine judges on the free skating panel were from different nations.On 10 April, the Korean Olympic Committee (KOC) and the Korean Skating Union (KSU) filed an official complaint with the ISU Disciplinary Commission (DC) concerning judging. The complaint was regarding \"the wrongful constitution of the panel of judges and the unjust outcome of the competition\". It requested that the DC conduct a thorough investigation, \"take appropriate disciplinary actions against the concerned individuals\", and institute corrective actions. On 14 April, the DC ruled the complaint inadmissible because a general request for investigation is not within DC's jurisdiction and the complaint was not addressed at an individual or federation as required.On 30 April, the KOC and KSU filed a second official complaint with the DC. This time the complaint was against Alla Shekhovtsova and Figure Skating Federation of Russia (FSFR), specifically citing a hug Shekhovtsova shared with Sotnikova and Shekhovtsova's marriage to the current Director General of the FSFR. On 30 May, the DC dismissed the complaint. It ruled Shekhovtsova \"is not responsible for the judging panel's composition\", her marriage did not create a conflict of interest, and since Sotnikova initiated the hug, Shekhovtsova did not break any rules by responding.As of June 2014, the KOC and KSU are considering appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\n\n\n==== Opinions ====\nUSA Today reported \"A high-ranking Olympic figure skating official \u2026 said the geographic makeup of the judging panel 'was clearly slanted towards \u2026 Sotnikova.'\" The free skating panel included two Russian officials, a Russian judge and a Ukrainian judge. Journalists questioned the appointments of Russian judge Alla Shekhovtsova, the wife of the former president and the current general director of Figure Skating Federation of Russia Valentin Piseev, and Ukrainian judge Yuri Balkov, who was suspended for a year after being caught on tape attempting to fix the ice dancing competition at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The technical panel, that oversees correct execution of elements, is headed by fellow Russian Alexander Lakernik. Shekhovtseva was photographed hugging Sotnikova in the arena, raising another question of bias. The detailed score sheet shows that one judge gave Adelina Sotnikova +3 grade of execution (GOE) on all except two elements. In contrast, the score sheet of short program shows that one judge gave Yuna Kim +0 grade of execution on her triple flip, of which the NBC commentator Tracy Wilson commented as 'another perfect flip'.Journalists and experts argued that scores given to Adelina Sotnikova were inflated both in the short and long programs. She was inexplicably scored above all others in the free program, where most believed she merited only 4th place in the phase behind Yuna, Mao Asada, and Carolina Kostner. Many among them cite that certain judges gave generous scores along with fellow Russian competitor Yulia Lipnitskaya. In particular, numerous +3 grade of executions were handed out to the two Russian skaters as well as nods in component scores compared to other skaters. Others noted that Sotnikova made a mistake by stepping out of one of her jumps which got a -0.9 grade of execution in the scorecards. Ryan Bradley, 2011 US champion, asked \"Are we just going to ignore that she botched the landing of her 3 jump and pretend she was perfect?\" There are also debates about whether Sotnikova's triple lutz had a wrong edge on takeoff and the triple toe loop in her first jumping pass was under-rotated. Neither error was flagged by the event's technical panel.  Retired national-level figure skater Tim Gerber wrote a letter to the ISU, claiming that Sotnikova's triple triple combination jump should have received wrong edge and under rotation. Gerber also asserted that the step sequence levels were not correctly awarded for Kim and Sotnikova. He stated that Kim's step sequence should have received a level four (instead of three) and Sotnikova's step sequence should have received a level three (instead of four), as Sotnikova's step sequence elements in free skating didn't meet the requirements to get level four, and Kim's met the requirements enough to get level four.Katarina Witt, a two-time Olympic champion, stated \"I am stunned by this result, I don\u2019t understand the scoring.\" Several experts have also pointed out how Kim and Kostner's programs have significantly better artistry, choreography and skill on ice that should translate to higher component marks to other skaters. One judge in the scoresheets gave out significantly lower marks to Kim and Kostner in the component marks. Sonia Garbato, seven-time Olympic figure skating judge and former high-ranking ISU official, wrote: \"No fair judge \u2026 could have awarded to Adelina higher marks in choreography, performance/execution, and interpretation of the music.\" Four-time world champion Kurt Browning also expressed his surprise at the results, declaring that he did not understand how Kim and Sotnikova could have been so close in the programme component scores. He also pointed out how Sotnikova had her component scores boosted compared to her previous programs  Michael Weiss, a two-time world bronze medalist, wrote \"couldn't disagree more that Yuna and Sotnikova had basically same Component marks?..in Both short & long? Home field inflation.\"  Dick Button, two-time Olympic champion and longstanding skating analyst, commented: \"Sotnikova was energetic, strong, commendable, but not a complete skater.\" A petition in Change.org against the results of the event demanding an investigation and rejudgment has amassed over 2 million supporters breaking several web traffic records on the website.\n\n\n== Athlete selection controversies ==\nSeveral controversial choices of the athletes going to the Olympics to represent countries have occurred.\nThe participation of Lebanese alpine skier Jackie Chamoun became controversial in Lebanon after it was revealed at home in 2014 that she had posed in sexy photos for an Austrian calendar in 2011. A ministerial investigation has been mooted, while an online support protest \"Strip for Jackie\" has been organized. Chamoun has denied that she posed nude publicly on her Facebook page, saying that the behind the scenes images were not for publication.In South Korea, a furore has erupted over the loss of Viktor Ahn (Ahn Hyun-Soo) to Team Russia. Several newspapers reported the scorn of the Korean public and newspaper editors on the actions of the Korea Skating Union. The minister of sport and president of South Korea have both promised action in rooting out corruption and feuding at the organization that may have led to his \"defection\", in a bid to clean it up in preparation for the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. The Korean public is generally supportive of Ahn.Selection of Ashley Wagner over Mirai Nagasu by the United States Olympic Team for ladies' singles figure skating caused some controversy, as at the selection competition, Nagasu finished ahead of Wagner. Wagner was selected on the body of her work, instead of the strength of her selection performance. The unclear selection process, and the fact that the second-place finisher Polina Edmunds had no international experience lead to some calls of racism, as the selection of Wagner over Nagasu was due to international results, while Edmunds' was not. This was the first time that the USFSA (United States Figure Skating Association) selected a skater who had competed in the selection trials and lost over another on who had also competed, previous times had done this only for skaters who had been injured and unable to compete at trials.Following the games in July, four Slovenian officials were suspended for four years from FIS after they helped to falsify times and rankings to allow alpine skier Vanessa Vanakorn (best known as the British violinist Vanessa-Mae and represented for Thailand as her father is a Thai) to achieve an average of 140 points of fewer at an FIS event to enable her to qualify for Olympics. At an FIS event in Krvavec, where she achieved her required score, she finished 6th (and last) in the national junior championships, despite being over 14 years older to the next eldest contestant. She also finished 7th (but last), 9th (of 13th) and 10th (of 13th). She finished with a total time of 3:26.97, 50.10 seconds behind the winner, Tina Maze of Slovenia. She was last among the finishers, ranking 67th. During investigations by FIS, it was revealed that the event was fixed to enable her to compete, for example a result including a competitor who was not present in the races, was placed 2nd in one race despite falling and her time was adjusted afterwards by more than 10 seconds, enabling a previously retired competitor who had the best FIS points in the competition to lower the penalty to benefit participants, failing to alter the course between runs and allowing the race to be run despite being suitable under regulations. As a result of taking part in a race rigged to her favor in an event orchestrated by her manager, Vanakorn was banned from skiing for four years.\n\n\n== Pegasus Airlines Flight 751 ==\nOn 7 February 2014, during the opening ceremony and one day after the start of the 2014 Winter Olympics, a man attempted to hijack Pegasus Airlines Flight 751 that was on a flight from Kharkiv, Ukraine, to Istanbul, Turkey, saying he had a bomb on board, and demanding to be flown to Sochi, the host city of the 2014 Winter Olympics. The pilots turned off the inflight monitors and landed at Istanbul's Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en Airport, fooling the man into thinking he was landing in Sochi. The plane, a Boeing 737-800 reg TC-CCP, was escorted to Istanbul by two Turkish F-16 fighter jets. The man, who appeared to be severely intoxicated, was detained by police and taken to the Istanbul Security Headquarters. In 2018, Russia's President Vladimir Putin admitted that he ordered the shooting down of a passenger plane that was reportedly carrying a bomb and targeting the opening of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\nDespite several expert statements that the construction of Olympic venues in the buffer area of the UNESCO protected Caucasus Biosphere Reserve and Sochi National Park could be harmful, the IOC approved the plans. Greenpeace of Russia said that the IOC and the Russian Government assumed all responsibility for any damage to the West Caucasus natural UNESCO World Heritage Site. According to the Sochi bid, a wide array of construction was planned in the Grushevyi Ridge area. They included a cascade of hydroelectric power stations on the Mzymta River, sewage treatment facilities, a high-speed rail link, a Mountain Olympic Village, a track for bobsleigh, luge and skeleton (which was relocated in May 2009), and a biathlon venue. Alpine skiing venues were being constructed in the Rosa Khutor plateau and the Psekhako Ridge area. Environmentalists proposed building up Krasnaya Polyana instead of destroying nature reserve sites.\nEnvironmentalists also opposed the plan of construction of a cargo terminal for ships in the mouth of the Psou River in the Imereti Lowland, because this could lead to the destruction of the largest areas of sea-flooded shore and marshes.On 3 July 2008, Vladimir Putin directed some of the Olympic venues, such as the luge and bobsleigh track, to be relocated (the Russian National Sliding Centre was relocated in May 2009). He said \"In setting our priorities and choosing between money and the environment, we're choosing the environment.\"Geologist Sergei Volkov fled to Ukraine after speaking out about environmental and geological problems. He stated that mercury and uranium deposits, as well as the probability of landslides, made the location of the games hazardous. He also argued that the location of a cargo port was inappropriate. A storm there killed three seamen and destroyed $14 million of infrastructure.On 29 October 2013 it was reported that Russia broke its 'Zero Waste' Olympic Pledge, as it emerged that Russia's state-owned rail monopoly was dumping tons of construction waste into an illegal landfill, raising concerns of possible contamination in the water that directly supplies Sochi.\n\n\n== Animal rights ==\nThe issue of stray dogs has come up before the Olympics. On 3 February 2014, the city hired a firm to exterminate the stray population \u2013 an approach that has brought international condemnation. These plans have been abandoned after complaints by local citizens. The stray dogs will be collected from the streets and put in a shelter.Russia originally planned to have two orca whales perform in the opening ceremonies of the Sochi 2014 Olympics. They were two of eight whales captured off the coast of Russia. After backlash by various advocacy groups and petitions signed by the general public, a statement was released that the whales would not be part of the Olympics. The current whereabouts of the whales are unknown.\nIt was rumored that the committee had planned to have a dolphin trained to carry the Olympic torch. Activists spoke up about the issue immediately, causing the President of the Olympics Committee, Dmitry Chernyshenko, to issue the statement that, \"I confirm that we do not involve any orcas or dolphins for the Olympics.\" Whether or not there had been any plans for a dolphin torchbearer has never been confirmed.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAccording to The New York Times the $50 billion or so lavished on Sochi is becoming a political liability. The stalling of the economy, despite the stimulus of Olympic spending, has raised worries about popular unrest directed at the Kremlin and a tightening of political freedoms in response once the Games are over. \"It is about what Russia could have done with this money.\" said Aleksei A. Navalny, the Foundation for the Fight Against Corruption.According to IRN.Ru analytical agency, prices for land, located next to the shoreline, reach $150,000 per 100 m\u00b2, while price per square metre in average panel apartment building on the outskirts of the city already reaches $2000. \"As a result of 2014 Olympics euphoria prices will rise annually by 15\u201320%,\" speculates Irina Tyurina, press secretary of Russian Tourist Industry Union. This could lead to decrease in tourist interest to Sochi, which already has fallen below Anapa, Gelendzhik and Adler.After the IOC Evaluation Commission visited Sochi in February 2007, local authorities promised to buy the lands from Lower Imereti Bay long-time residents for a fair market price. But during the following half a year, no local resident could get their land approved as private property.While most Olympic Games have high cost overruns, for these Games they are much higher than usual. Much of the cost overruns have been blamed on corruption, with Boris Nemtsov claiming: \"The Sochi Olympics are an unprecedented thieves' caper in which representatives of Putin's government are mixed up along with the oligarchs close to the government.\"  According to research by Transparency International, a global anti-corruption watchdog, approximately 50 percent or more of the building costs went to corruption.Poor workers conditions and rights have also been raised as an issue of concern, with at least 25 people dying and many more injured in accidents on sites in 2012 and with workers not getting paid at all.\n\n\n== Circassians ==\n\nCircassian organisations have also spoken out against the Olympics, arguing that the Games will take place on land that had been inhabited by them since the beginning of recorded history by their ancestors until 1864, when the resolution of the Russian\u2013Circassian War was stated to have caused the disappearance (variously by death or deportation) of 1.5 million Circassians, or 90-94% of the Circassian nation. They are demanding the Sochi 2014 Olympics be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologises for what the Circassians regard to be a genocide. Some Circassian groups have not expressed outright opposition to the Olympics but argue that symbols of Circassian history and culture should be included in the format, as Australia, the United States, and Canada did with their indigenous populations in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.The games are viewed to be particularly offensive because they include the date of the 150th anniversary of what they consider a genocide. It has thus been a rallying cry for Circassian nationalists.In particular, there is much ire over the use of a hill called \"Red Hill\". In 1864, a group of Circassians apparently tried to return home but were attacked and a battle ensued, ending in their massacre, and attaining the name \"Red Hill\" (for the blood spilled). There were skiing and snowboarding events planned to be held on this hill.\n\n\n== Political stability and governance ==\nThe 2008 Russia\u2013Georgia war, which broke out at the start of the 2008 Summer Olympics, surprised the Olympic community. \"It is not what the world wants to see. It is contrary to what the Olympic ideal stands for\", said an IOC spokesperson. However, in November 2008, the IOC turned down a request by the Georgian National Olympic Committee to reconsider its decision to hold the Olympics on the territory \"adjacent both to the [Russian-]occupied Abkhaz conflict zone, and to the extremely unstable and volatile North Caucasus\".\nRelated concerns persist, regarding the region's safety and the desirability of hosting an Olympics in a conflict-ridden zone. \"The region is such a muddied and bloodied aquarium of conflict that to pick out any one fish is impossible,\" says Oleg Nechiporenko, chief analyst for Russia's National Anti-Terrorist and Anti-Criminal Fund, in response to a 26 May 2010, car bombing, whose suspects include Russian nationalists, local Russian mafia groups, separatists and Islamists in the North Caucasus, or a remnant of the war in Abkhazia.Sochi borders Russia's six autonomous North Caucasus republics, home of the Second Chechen War which allegedly face social problems. According to an article in Daily Telegraph, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, head of Saudi intelligence, allegedly confronted the Kremlin with a mix of inducements and threats in a bid to break the deadlock over Syria. This included security of winter olympics in Sochi if there is no accord. \"I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us,\" he allegedly said.Russian Envoy to the North Caucasus Alexander Khloponin told local law enforcement that \"the violent scramble for assets\" is likely to get worse as Russia invests heavily in tourist infrastructure and Olympic-caliber ski resorts.\n\n\n=== Safety ===\nThree suicide bombings in Volgograd, one in October 2013 and the others in December 2013, have raised additional international concerns about security during the Olympics. The IOC expressed sympathy for the victims and underlined that they trusted that Russia's security arrangements for the Olympics would be adequate.The British, German, Italian, Hungarian, Austrian, Slovenian and Slovakian Olympic associations received threats that athletes would be \"blown up\" or kidnapped by terrorists at the Winter Games. According to the IOC, the letters did not represent any real threat.\n\nOn 7 February 2014, during the opening ceremony, a Pegasus Airlines flight from Kharkiv, Ukraine, to Istanbul, Turkey, was threatened by a passenger who attempted to hijack the jetliner with a demand to be flown to Sochi. The man would be detained by police and taken into custody.\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nIOC President Thomas Bach criticized attempts to politicize the Games, saying that governments should not send political messages \"on the backs of their athletes.\" Benjamin Bidder of Spiegel Online and Julia Ioffe of The New Republic compared the negative pre-Sochi coverage to schadenfreude and Russophobia, while Anton Fedyashin of The Guardian blamed lingering Cold War mentalities for \"dishing up a feast of negativity.\" In an editorial published by The Nation, scholar of Russian studies Stephen F. Cohen criticized the \"toxic coverage\" for \"exploiting the threat of terrorism so licentiously it seemed pornographic.\" He further wrote that \"American media on Russia today are less objective, less balanced, more conformist and scarcely less ideological than when they covered Soviet Russia during the Cold War.\"According to The Guardian the games were more politicised than the before, serving as shameless promotion of Putin's Russia. While former world chess champion and Russian opposition figure Garry Kasparov said that game bolstered Putin's cult of personality.Comedians and satirical newspapers took advantage of the widespread pessimism. On 8 February, The Daily Currant posted a story alleging that a man responsible for operating the Olympic rings during the opening ceremony, which famously suffered a technical glitch, had been \"found dead...with multiple stab wounds.\" The fictional story went viral on social media. On 20 February, luger Kate Hansen posted a well-publicized video on her Twitter account allegedly showing a wolf roaming the hallways of her Sochi hotel; it was later revealed to be a hoax staged by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and Hansen. USA Luge officials distanced themselves from the incident, with spokesman Sandy Caligiore stating, \"I can tell you that our organization is not happy with the incident. Sochi problems? Sochi fail? That's not USA Luge speaking.\" Throughout the duration of the Olympics the @SochiProblems Twitter account had nearly 100,000 more followers than the official IOC feed @Sochi2014. The blog GossipSochi.com was later set up to debunk @SochiProblems postings, with many revealed to be fakes.In an interview, IOC supervisor Jean-Claude Killy stated that several hotels intended to house the foreign media were unfinished by the opening of the Olympics because officials realized \"too late\" that construction had fallen behind. According to David Wallechinsky, president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, many of the incidents early in the Olympics were \"standard problems\" and were not unique to Sochi. Wallechinsky further noted, \"When you mess up with the media before the Games start, you're going to have a problem.\" In an interview that aired on Russian television on 24 February, Vladimir Putin opined that much of the criticism stemmed from rivalry in international politics, saying \"There is a cohort of critics that are far from sport, they are engaged in a competitive struggle in international politics. They used this Olympic project to achieve their own objectives in the field of anti-Russian propaganda.\"The mood greatly improved as the Games progressed. With a few notable exceptions, NBC largely avoided broadcasting negative material, although several segments deemed \"overly friendly to Russia\" were criticized by some U.S. commentators. Following the closing ceremony, Mark Sappenfield of The Christian Science Monitor concluded that by many measures the Olympics were \"very successful.\" Sappenfield singled out the organization as particularly good, writing that \"Athletes and Olympic officials were nearly unanimous: This was an extraordinarily well run Olympics.\" Thomas Bach also voiced support, stating \"We saw excellent Games and what counts most is the opinions of the athletes and they were enormously satisfied...You have to ask all those who criticised whether they change their opinions now.\"\n\n\n== 2014 Russian Formula One Grand Prix ==\nIn 2014, Sochi hosted the Russian Formula One Grand Prix. The circuit runs in and around the Sochi Olympic Park, which led to the IOC expressing concern that construction of the circuit could disrupt preparations for the Olympic Games. The IOC was granted the power to delay the inaugural race until 2015 in order to ensure the Olympics were held without disruption, but did not use it as competition was not disrupted.\n\n\n== Countries choosing not to enter competitors ==\nA total of 91 nations qualified to compete at the Games. However, three nations chose not to send their athletes to the Games, even though they had met the international qualification standards.\nPuerto Rico is not sending Kristina Krone for the second consecutive time because the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee (COPUR) withdrew its recognition of the Puerto Rico Winter Sports Federation after the 2002 Winter Olympics due to an eligibility controversy involving a member of their bobsled team. According to COPUR president Sara Rosario, \"Until there is a properly constituted winter sports federation with the requisite seriousness upon which we can consistently rely every four years, we cannot endorse (participation by Puerto Rico athletes in the Olympic Winter Games)\". Krone has represented Puerto Rico since 2008 in more than 100 alpine ski competitions sanctioned by the International Ski Federation including the 2009, 2011 and 2013 World Alpine Ski Championships.South Africa would not enter skier Sive Speelman, who, although invited to compete by the IOC, did not meet the standards set by the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee.Algeria also chose not to enter its only competitor, Mehdi-Selim Khelifi, because he was the only one that managed to qualify, even though he was their only entry four years prior at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\n\n== Independent participants ==\nThere were three Independent Olympic participants from India who competed under the Olympics flag. In December 2012, the Indian Olympic Association was suspended by the IOC due to government interference in the autonomy and election of leaders, thus not complying with the Olympic charter. Fresh elections were due to take place after the opening ceremony so Indian athletes were scheduled to participate as independents.\n\n\n== Course adjustments ==\nA crash in practice from Norwegian slopestyle snowboarder Torstein Horgmo, who fractured his collarbone, and complaints from other athletes that some jumps were too steep have prompted organizers to modify the slopestyle course in the week before the Games. A few days later the women's downhill ski training was stopped after the opening three racers were getting too much air on the jump down the home stretch. The International Ski Federation had workers adjusting the course making it smoother.\n\n\n== Inadequate preparation of visitor facilities ==\nIn the week prior to the start of the Games, reports began coming out of Sochi that a number of the accommodations for visitors and journalists were still incomplete. Several hotels meant to house visitors to the Games were reported to be still under construction upon arrival, as well as missing basic furniture from some of the rooms that had finished construction. The issues forced a number of visitors to seek alternate accommodations. Other problems reported included \"piles of garbage\" on the streets of the media village, as well as significant construction noise.Other notable incidents:\n\nJohnny Quinn, member of the US bobsled team, became trapped in his bathroom and had to bash a hole in the door to get out.\nStacy St. Clair, Chicago Tribune reporter, reported that her hotel had no water, and that staff informed her that when it returned, not to wash her face in it as it was dangerous. The water service that returned provided murky dark water. The \"dangerous face water\" incident went viral.\n\n\n== Use of mourning symbols ==\nDuring the women's 15 kilometre skiathlon four Norwegian skiers used black mourning binds in honor of teammate Astrid Uhrenholdt Jacobsen's brother who had died unexpectedly on the opening day of the Olympics. IOC sent a reminder to the Norwegian Olympic Committee (NOC) that using mourning binds was not allowed during the games. IOC's letter caused protests in Norway and Sweden. NOC general secretary Inge Andersen met with IOC president Thomas Bach to discuss the matter on 10 February 2014. Norway's IOC member Gerhard Heiberg indicated that IOC would reconsider the ban against mourning binds.Freestyle skiers were told by IOC not to wear helmet stickers in memory of Sarah Burke, who died in an accident in 2012. However, many still did, and the rule was believed to not have been enforced.\nOn 19 February Ukrainian athletes asked for and were refused permission by the IOC to wear black arm bands to honor those killed in the violent clashes in Kiev the previous day. According to IOC spokesman Mark Adams \"They weren't forbidden to wear armbands. The Ukrainian NOC met with IOC officials informally yesterday. They discussed what should be done, and they reached the conclusion there were other ways of marking this moment. Some athletes have taken other views and other ways of doing things\". IOC president Bach offered his condolences \"to those who have lost loved ones in these tragic events\".\n\n\n== Athlete boycott ==\nOn 19 February 2014 Ukrainian alpine skier Bohdana Matsotska refused to further participate in the Olympic Games in protest of the violent clashes in Kiev on the previous day. She and her father posted a message on Facebook stating \"In solidarity with the fighters on the barricades of the Maidan, and as a protest against the criminal actions made towards the protesters, the irresponsibility of the president and his lackey government, we refuse further performance at the Olympic Games in Sochi 2014\".On 20 February 2014 the Ukrainian NOC reported that as many as half of the 45 Ukrainian athletes at the Olympics had left the games to return home. But according to Ukrainian NOC president Sergey Bubka they had returned home in compliance with their original schedule, and their departure was thus not related to the riots in Kiev.\n\n\n== Drug tests ==\nDuring the 2014 Winter Olympics, six athletes tested positive for banned substances and were sent home from the Games.\nOn 21 February, skier Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle of Germany and Italian bobsleigh brakeman William Frullani were both sent home from Sochi after failing drugs tests. They both tested positive for methylhexanamine. On 22 February, Ukrainian cross-country skier Marina Lisogor was tested positive for trimetazidine and Latvian ice hockey player Vitalijs Pavlovs tested positive for methylhexaneamine. On 23 February, Austrian skier Johannes D\u00fcrr tested positive for EPO and Swedish ice hockey player Nicklas B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m tested positive for a substance found in an allergy medication.\n\n\n== Men's freestyle skiing \u2013 ski cross ==\nBoth Canada and Slovenia appealed separately to the Court of Arbitration for Sport that the three French athletes in the Big Final of the men's ski cross final had their pants illegally changed by their coach. They argued it gave the three an aerodynamic advantage over the rest of the field. Both countries first appealed to the International Ski Federation, but were rejected since they appealed hours after the end of the competition (when the deadline was 15 minutes after the close of the race). The appeal to the court was ultimately unsuccessful as well, because the court agreed with the ski federation that the appeal was filed past the deadline.\n\n\n== Russian Mafia used to threaten rival campaign allegations ==\nThe Russian mafia helped Russia win the games by threatening the Salzburg campaign leader Fedor Radmann, who later resigned in 2007, according to German security officials. Informants observed a meeting between mafia leaders and Russian government foreign policy advisor Sergei Prikhodko in 2006 in a Munich restaurant to discuss the Olympic selection process. Radmann himself denies he ever met any Russian mobsters but his colleagues state that he feared for his life, and the mayor of Salzburg Heinz Schaden confirms the link.\n\n\n== See also ==\nConcerns and controversies at the 2010 Winter Olympics\nConcerns and controversies at the 2012 Summer Olympics\nList of 2018 FIFA World Cup controversies\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The aquarium is small. The price of the ticket is obviously overpriced. You can feed the fish with special food that is sold inside. Next to the entrance is a pool enclosed with colored mazaykoy, though without water. \u2026",
          "Oceanarium interesting. Beautiful fish. Beautiful aquariums. There are small sharks. Many stingrays, but small stingrays. There is an opportunity to feed the fish. Food can be purchased in the same machine. Of the \u2026",
          "Very poor exhibition. Price does not match content\n\n",
          "For children it will be interesting, but not for adults. All fish and marine creatures can be seen in ordinary zoos. Expected much more for the marine aquarium. A little disappointed. And work, please, with the staff \u2026",
          "We are going around so-so, nothing special, the size is small. The price tag of 800 rubles did not live up to expectations, it is better to go half the price in the Riviera park\n\n",
          "A good aquarium with a variety of marine life. Everything is beautifully decorated, lights everywhere. You can take pictures without flash. You can purchase special food and feed the fish. An adult ticket costs 800 \u2026",
          "Clean, well-kept aquariums, beautiful inhabitants of the expanses of water. I was pleased that between the expositions there are spacious, beautifully decorated areas between the halls, enough light for selfies. \u2026",
          "Interesting place for children, a lot of different fish. But on the day off it is better not to meddle, a giant line of people at the checkout. If you want to save your time, then look for a shop with tickets at the \u2026",
          "A show of mermaids is a must see for everyone. Children will be thrilled. The rest is small and not very interesting.\n\n",
          "In general, I really liked it. An interesting place to visit especially with children. If you have never been sure to visit.\n\n",
          "Large, modern aquarium. Yes, there is something to see. This is my second visit. It is sad that the number of aquariums decreased, their condition worsened significantly.\n\n",
          "Not bad, but not enough for the price of 800 rubles per ticket\n\n",
          "Caught on feeding fish and shows with mermaids. The children were very impressed. You can feed the carp straight from the hands. Wow\n\n",
          "Beautiful, interesting excursions, many \"representatives of the vast expanses of water\", little mermaids under water entertain guests in a large \"aquarium\". There is a souvenir shop. We were with the whole family \u2026",
          "a lot of fish and other aquatic inhabitants. there are good performances with mermaids and a fish feeder.\n\nin the first photograph, the man who feeds the fish hugs the turtle\n\n",
          "If you were in a Moscow house or the like, then do not waste money. 15-20 minutes will go for everything. If the first time, then it will be quite good\n\n",
          "Getting is not convenient, parking is paid. Cashless payment did not work. We did not take cash. Waited an hour until the terminal is working. We got a check, but it turned out that the payment did not go through due \u2026",
          "A wonderful place to relax with the whole family, it occupies two floors, you can hide from the heat of the day and enjoy the fish, the tour is interesting, a magical performance with the Little Mermaid, you can feed \u2026",
          "Honestly - this time they didn\u2019t go inside. For insane money without normal discounts, for example, having many children, there was a lineup on April 3. Because there is nowhere else to go! With the children, the sea \u2026",
          "It was cool!\nWe liked)\nIt was beautiful and interesting there! \ud83d\ude04\nThere were our favorite turtles and stingrays (which are so funny \ud83d\udc25)\n\n",
          "Good, but not very large aquarium. If possible, it is better to visit Moskumrium. And if you were there, there is nothing to do.\nThe only highlight is that a mermaid is swimming with fish in one of the aquarian \u2026",
          "I was not impressed: everything is in the twilight, not only are the tickets expensive, but also photography is paid, feed the fish - give me the money again. And at the exit, the souvenir museum - the prices are \u2026",
          "A lot of fish, it is interesting to watch them. There is an opportunity for an additional fee to listen to the tour of the Oceanarium. It is interesting to feed the fish \ud83d\ude0a\n\n",
          "Very interesting, informative, cool! You can immediately get on two shows, if advance familiarize yourself with the program. We observed feeding and the show \ud83e\udddc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and the human amphibian. \ud83d\udc4d\n\n",
          "A bunch of ordinary fish, which can be seen in home aquariums.\nExotics very little. Sharks are there and it's cool, but they are few. Literally pieces 5-6. A pair of large moray eels. Big turtle ... Underwater tunnel. \u2026",
          "Somehow gloomy and dreary. Maybe because they were in the winter ...\n\n",
          "Were in aquariums in different countries, ours is not inferior to anything! Respect\n\n",
          "So far the best aquarium that I have seen. Beautiful, clean. A lot of fish, souvenirs to remember. Even got to the underwater show with mermaids. It only spoils the lack of signposts and close parking for visiting the \u2026",
          "Little. I expected more. There are few fish. 800 adults and 500 children for this similarity is expensive. Children did not like it.\n\n",
          "Beautiful, interesting. The price is expensive for me. 800 rub. for an adult, 500 for children. Stood in line for 1 hour, a little less time spent there.\n\n",
          "The show of mermaids and when the driver feeds the fish leave an unforgettable experience !!!\n\n",
          "It\u2019s interesting, especially with children, you can study the types of fish) there is an aquarium tunnel Another room where white lights in the dark is also cool)) there is a gift shop on the territory, a toilet and \u2026",
          "Perfect place! So many different fishes! Beautiful illuminated aquariums, near each plate with the name of the inhabitants and information about them. There are open aquariums with koi fish that you can feed! Funny \u2026",
          "I liked it very much, everyone should visit at least once, in the summer the queues are certainly straining\n\n",
          "The ticket is expensive, the aquarium is too small. At the entrance is a beautiful jungle, fish in the pools and aquariums. The main plus is feeding fish, one capsule with food 50 rubles (cash only), a 2.5-year-old \u2026",
          "A good place to stay for the whole family. Here you can find out a lot of interesting things about the underwater world. Take an excursion. Not expensive, but much more interesting.\n\n",
          "The child was very interesting to consider different fish. You can even feed some if you buy food there (worth 50 rubles). It is very interesting when the aquarium passes overhead.\n\n",
          "Good aquarium. Cost of attendance: adult 800\u20bd, child from 4 years old 500\u20bd, + 50\u20bd feed - you can not deprive a child of such a pleasure to feed carps. I think it's a little expensive for this aquarium, although I got \u2026",
          "If you want your rest to be remembered not only burnt back - go to the aquarium. Tickets are not cheap, but when you come in, you will understand what you are paying for. A lot of fish and sea animals. And also here \u2026",
          "Not interested at all. The price does not justify the high.\n\n",
          "The ticket is for an adult + -800, and for children 500. The oceanarium looks large, but it seemed small to me. There is information about each fish, shark.\n\n",
          "Oceanarium is one name.\nWith Moskvarium not compare. The exposure is small, but money is taken normally. It is not worth it.\n\n",
          "Great place, it is necessary to the room .... if they have never been, then especially, especially for children .. it is less than 2 times Moscow exactly, but still interesting ... it's impossible to park near ... \u2026",
          "Small benches are important along the way. A lot of children, nowhere to sit. It's minus\n\n",
          "Very beautiful and interesting for children and adults! The main thing when visiting is not to forget warm clothes, the halls are quite cool.\n\n",
          "Disappointment! Expecting something more. Well, yes, fish. In the zoo, too. The tunnel .. Not very ... The passage is very narrow, everyone is photographed. It seems that people were not very many, but closely. It is \u2026",
          "Large aquarium. Like the whole family. Children are delighted as well as parents. There are sharks, turtles, Koi fish and other animals. Entrance fee is 800 rubles per adult, children under 5 are free.\n\n",
          "Very cool, but expensive all the same. 800.00 rubles is too much. If my memory serves me, then in Antalya it\u2019s cheaper to go, but the sizes can\u2019t be compared\n\n",
          "Small but cozy. Aquariums with sea fish are not many and not very diverse. The performances of the \"mermaids\" are a huge plus, for the aquarium, exactly like feeding fish (50 rubles a portion of food). The price of \u2026",
          "Inside the stuffiness !!! We traveled from Riviera Park by bus, the journey took about 30-40 minutes. In front of the aquarium park. Inside there are many types of fish, it is interesting to watch them.\n\n",
          "A lot of people, a lot of people.\nExpected a smaller crush and a larger area.\nIf you are close, then go. Going specifically - it makes no sense.\n\n",
          "Everything is good here, a lot of fish and marine life. But I was in Anapa in the aquarium and there it\u2019s almost the same, except for the tunnels of glass, but the glass is blurry, so you need to come close anyway. \u2026",
          "A good place to visit with children. The oceanarium is not big, but spectacular. And children do not have time to get tired. You can buy food and feed the carp. A good gift shop. Not very convenient access and small \u2026",
          "A good option for both children and adults.\n\n",
          "We liked the children of 5 and 7 years old! Were on Wednesday after 14.00 in the beginning of October. There were few people. The size of the exposure is less than in Antalya, but it seemed more interesting to us) \u2026",
          "A lot of aquarium fish. In specialized stores, aquariums are better decorated. In a large marine aquarium, mermaids are clearly superfluous.\n\n",
          "Modern, well, beautiful. Wonderful color scheme in the design. A variety of fish. Good intellectual and aesthetic entertainment for the family. Ticket 800. But do not regret paying extra 50 for the tour. Photos for \u2026",
          "Moscow is better\n\n",
          "Just super. Not only children were delighted, but also adults. The mermaids show alone is worth it.\n\n",
          "everything is fine, but the staff is rude, and go to the toilet at the entrance, they will not let me go back\n\n",
          "The aquarium is good, but in bad weather, with an influx, stupid staff can not cope. \"Are we to blame for the fact that so many of you have come here?\" Queue for an hour and a half.\n\n",
          "In principle, everything is fine, I don\u2019t know, they write the negative, why are you going here, go where you feel good, I have also been to different parts of the world and have seen a lot, but about this I can say \u2026",
          "Huge aquarium. When we were there with the child for the first time - there were many impressions. I especially liked to feed the fish in the outdoor pools))\n\n",
          "I like this place very much, you can feed carp here. There are benches, and a huge panoramic aquarium. There is an elevator. There is a huge lack of toilet only at the entrance !!! There are problems with children. \u2026",
          "It is very beautiful, at 14.00 feeding of marine inhabitants begins, the cat turns into a show, lasts about 30 minutes, at 15.00 they start fascinatingly dancing in the main mermaid aquarium. Children are delighted \u2026",
          "I like it. Yes, it is small, not comparable with Moscow or Barcelona, but it has everything you need: many species of fish, an unusual interior, a real mermaid (the child watched spellbound) and Ihtiandr, a \u2026",
          "The price is unreasonably high. The aquarium is small. There\u2019s nothing to look at. Were in the Oceanarium on about. Russian, there really is a gorgeous oceanarium.\n\n",
          "Interesting. It is a pity because of the large number of visitors is not well considered. And the prices I think bent.\n\n",
          "Like me and kids. A bunch of beautiful inhabitants of the sea and ocean depths. Fascinating mermaid show. Thank you for the pleasant impressions, will be back again.\n\n",
          "Awful Huge lines that have no end. Tickets can be bought exclusively at the box office on the spot or from resellers standing at the crossings. There is no question of the possibility of buying an online ticket in \u2026",
          "Interesting, but too many people. Had to stand in line to watch. Allowed with strollers and scooters. The child was driven into the crowd by a stroller, the impression was spoiled\n\n",
          "Gorgeous aquarium, you can feed the fish, but I would like to see more. The aquarium itself is not big, but in general this is enough\n\n",
          "It is impossible to compare with the Israeli aquarium Adlersky. Although there are many fishes of different sorts; which you can feed. In Israel it is impossible!\nSnake terrarium is impressive\n\nAnd the Mermaid show is \u2026",
          "Great place. I advise everyone. 800 rubles an adult ticket. 50 rubles guide\n\n",
          "Very interesting! It is a pity that there are no jellyfish ... And I would like for more exhibits! The decor class! In general, you can go!\n\n",
          "Expectations were more than I saw. It\u2019s hard to call a large aquarium. Small and very small fish exposure\n\n",
          "Were at the aquarium for the second time, there is always something to see, I really like going there, watching fish, especially stingrays and small sharks.\nThis time I was lucky to meet a diver in one of the pools, \u2026",
          "The place is not as big as you see it ...\n\n",
          "Got to the aquarium very well. There were few people, only our excursion group. Children were interested.\n\n",
          "Very great place for the whole family. Clean, tidy, staff are polite. And a lot of all marine life, including moray eels and sharks.\n\n",
          "I would put five if it were not for the Russian approach. (If you have children, then it\u2019s most interesting for them to see a mermaid in the aquarium. From Sochi, we drove a special hour to see the little mermaid. \u2026",
          "This is a must see. Words are hard.\n\n",
          "Diving is great. The instruction is excellent. Super coach\n\n",
          "Very nice and informative. Great tour guide for a minimal fee. Mermaid show just class.\n\n",
          "If you are interested in the secrets of the underwater world - you definitely need to visit the Adler Oceanarium. You will not only get acquainted with the inhabitants of the depths, read interesting information about \u2026",
          "The cost does not match the proposed service. The ticket price was supposed to be 400 rubles, at least from children under 14, for 2 adults and two children paid 3200 rubles, this is overkill. Maybe there would be \u2026",
          "Three times less than the Moscow Oceanarium. The price tag of \u00a3 800 per adult is overstated, of course. It is suitable to spend time during the rest \"seal\". Stuffy when a lot of people. A \u201cfree\u201d photo with jaws at the \u2026",
          "A show with mermaids, a beautiful background in each aquarium, the ability to feed the inhabitants, but in general the aquarium is not large and runs very quickly.\n\n",
          "We got to the show presentation on 12/31/2019, under the IMPRESSION !!!\n\n",
          "I thought it would be better. Not as big as they say. Better - sharks, feeding turtles and feeding fish (such as carpics chtoli)\n\n",
          "I\u2019ve already said and uploaded the photo, and once again I\u2019ll say we are just delighted. The animals show that they work not from under the stick. Who has the opportunity to go, do not regret it!\n\n",
          "Cool, remembering childhood. In the very south of ours. In Adler (although they write Sochi). Adler is. The very one. And reluctance to leave\n\n",
          "Everything was very good and wonderful. The kids really liked it. Thank you very much.\n\n",
          "For the first time, they were in this aquarium. Compared to St. Petersburg, it\u2019s relatively small. But it will be interesting. They stood in line for tickets for 45 minutes, 35 minutes inside)))))\n\n",
          "If you have been to the Oceanarium in Moscow - you will find a huge disappointment here. Besides the fact that the minimum exposure. Serious difficulties with ventilation. It's hard to breathe. The child became sick. \u2026",
          "All liked it. It\u2019s bad that a very large queue for tickets. People stand even on the street.\n\n",
          "Staff dissatisfied, long queues, very few sea animals. It costs 800 rubles 1 adult ticket. If you walk along the ocean very slowly and read everything that is written, then it will take you all 50 minutes. The price \u2026",
          "Very interesting! But still a little expensive. The whole family visited 2900 ... And it was stuffy in the gallery, they were about 8 years ago, nothing has changed in this regard, unfortunately\n\n",
          "Nice place. Not the largest, of course, of those that we visited. But there were good impressions!\n\n",
          "Would have liked for younger children. Child 14l was not very interesting. Yes, and the price is too high, does not correspond to what he saw\n\n",
          "Enough is not a bad oceanarium, of course less than in St. Petersburg or MSC. The only thing ... it seemed that the glasses in large aquariums are poorly cleaned from the inside, it\u2019s unclear\n\n",
          "I would not say that Ohhhh, but the children will be interested.\n\nThe most I liked was the long corridor and the fish above you\n\n",
          "The kids really liked it. And for myself there were discoveries.\nA huge minus is that when you exit you get into the street. Ie you can not leave the outerwear if it is cold or rain. Forced to carry her with you. And \u2026",
          "Handsomely. Interesting. You can visit several times.\n\n",
          "It\u2019s interesting for the children .... a chic underwater tunnel ... The queue at the cash desk .... but there is an option ... if you walk 100 meters forward between the houses, go to the street-market and walk almost \u2026",
          "For the aquarium, located next to the sea, very modest. A lot of people at the box office, near the aquariums, for 3k.\nThe only thing I liked was the painted walls in ultraviolet)\n I also want to note the deplorable \u2026",
          "There are very few expositions, like all Sochi stupid fundraising. 800 r per shark is a mockery. Super aquarium in Vladivostok costs the same money\n\n",
          "Were in November. The people are not very many. Children cost 300, adult 500. We spent about 30 minutes on everything. We liked the tunnel very much, in the form of an arch. You go, and on both sides and above your \u2026",
          "Well, personally, I did not really like it! Well, as they say, there are no friends in the taste and color.\n\n",

          "Compared with Moscow, it seemed less, and once it\u2019s worth going, it will be especially interesting for children.\n\n",
          "A very beautiful show program, but it takes place at certain times\n\n",
          "Place to explore the fish. There is entertainment for both children and adults - feeding fish. If a lot of money - you can feed the fish in scuba under water. With parking there are difficulties.\n\n",
          "I liked everything very much .... The only thing is to add electronic terminals for buying tickets. Two ticket offices can not cope with such a mass of people who want to buy a ticket.\n\n",
          "A good aquarium, but if you go with a jaunty child, you will quickly reach the end))) Carps and their feeding (you can buy food in the machine) and the underwater tunnel with sharks and other fish turned out to be the \u2026",
          "He takes 3rd place in Russia, I really liked the transparent glass tunnel.\n\n",
          "A small oceanarium in Sochi. There are aquariums with tropical fish, sturgeon, sharks, a tiny terrarium with turtles. The size of the exposure is small, you can go around in an hour. The most spectacular is the \u2026",
          "Not a bad aquarium. Beautiful program with a scuba diver. You can feed the fish. Want bigger.\n\n",
          "Everything cool. The abundance of aquariums, each description of the fish. You can feed the fish in the pond. They are accustomed, float to everyone. Underwater tunnel, sharks, turtles, stingrays ....\n\n",
          "Very impressed with the oceanarium! Large, bright, a lot of marine inhabitants, long tunnels, mermaids. In general, I recommend!\n\n",
          "A lot of people are all pushed and run somewhere. Parking no car attach is very difficult. It is better to buy tickets from the grandmother to the will of dentistry. a huge queue\n\n",
          "Visited this aquarium while being on vacation in the city of Sochi! Was frankly disappointed from this place. The location is not very convenient, we had to walk a lot from the parking lot due to the remoteness. I had \u2026",
          "Many different fish, an interesting tunnel. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s always or not, but before us a mermaid swam, waved her hands at children and sent kisses.\n\n",
          "Not worth the money! I have something to compare! For tickets, people are an hour and a half, despite the fact that the ticket can be bought on the way from the stop to the aquarium, from distributors for the same \u2026",
          "Located in Adler, I liked everything very much, affordable prices, did not regret visiting, it was very beautiful, like in a fairy tale, under water!\n\n",

          "There have already been several times, the child is delighted with the fish. Very filled aquarium. You can feed the fish\n\n",
          "Admission ticket 800 rubles. For large discounts there. They paid 3100 rubles for a family of two adults and three children. And if you go with a guide, you need another 50 rubles. for each lay out. It is not worth \u2026",
          "Interesting fish, many different aquariums. Over 50 p. in the machine you can buy special food for fish and feed them.\n\n",
          "There were a lot of visitors, apparently did not expect this, did not cope well, the organization was lame. And I would like more friendly staff.\n\n",
          "The oceanarium in Adler is the largest not only in Sochi, but also in the south of Russia. Admission by ticket, cost from 400 to 800 rubles. We walked around the halls of the oceanarium for 4 hours and were amazed by \u2026",
          "In January 2019, the entrance cost 800\u20bd for adults. Children under 4 years free.\nAt the entrance there is a machine with a food for fish on 50\u20bd. You can feed the fish in the outdoor pool.\nStaff Pts friendly, even the \u2026",
          "This is not an aquarium, but ... discarded money. There are no benefits, there\u2019s nothing to watch either. If you have ever been to any aquarium, then do not go, do not waste money.\n\n",
          "Very good cozy fish a lot\n\n",
          "The place is wonderful. Recommended to visit. There is a slight feeling of overpricing (800 adults, 500 children), which is compensated if you get to feed the fish and show mermaids.\nWithout the above measures, the \u2026",
          "Quite interesting, especially the first time. It is not very big, but neat. Kids will like it.\n\n",

          "The child was delighted!\nAnd adults too.\nBut it is worth visiting on a weekday \u2014 when many people consider everything to fail.\n\n",
          "Nice aquarium, but 800 rubles. a little expensive. You can feed the carp for 50r\n\n",
          "Too small aquarium. You can slowly go for 20 minutes. But they hold a show there - feeding turtles and mermaids. If you go without a show, the aquarium is not worth the money.\n\n",

        "wiki": "Sochi (Russian: \u0421\u043e\u0301\u0447\u0438, IPA: [\u02c8sot\u0255\u026a] (listen)) is a city in Krasnodar Krai. It is located in Western Russia, on the Black Sea coast near Russia's southern border. The Greater Sochi area, which includes territories and localities subordinated to Sochi proper, has a total area of 3,526 square kilometers (1,361 sq mi) and sprawls for 145 kilometers (90 mi) along the shores of the Black Sea near the Caucasus Mountains. The area of the city proper is 176.77 square kilometers (68.25 sq mi). According to the 2010 Census, the city had a permanent population of 343,334, up from 328,809 recorded in the 2002 Census, making it Russia's largest resort city. Being part of the Caucasian Riviera, it is one of the very few places in Russia with a subtropical climate, with warm to hot summers and mild winters.\nWith the alpine and Nordic events held at the nearby ski resort of Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi hosted the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, as well as the Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix from 2014 until at least 2020. It was also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore the whole area was conquered by Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian invaders, the Zygii people lived in Lesser Abkhazia under the Kingdom of Pontus, then the Roman Empire's influence in antiquity. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of Lazica and Abkhazia, who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was unified under the single Georgian monarchy in 11th-century, forming one of the Saeristavo, known as Tskhumi extending its possessions up to Nicopsis. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading Alans, Khazars, Mongols and other nomadic empires whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century Byzantine basilica still stands in the Loo Microdistrict.From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi known as Ubykhia was part of historical Circassia, and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, which was their principal trading partner in the Muslim world.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nThe coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Caucasian War and the Russo-Turkish War, 1828\u20131829; however, the Circassians did not admit the Russian control over Circassia and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the Circassian coast (Adyghe: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044b \u0430\u0443\u0448\u0443). Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the Russian Empire and the British Empire that occurred in 1836 over the mission of the Vixen.The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron Feodor Tornau investigated the coastal route from Gelendzhik to Gagra, and across the mountains to Kabarda, in the 1830s. In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the Sochi River as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky in order to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on Cape Adler soon after.\nThe last battle of the Caucasian War took place at the Godlikh river on March 18, 1864 O.S., where the Ubykhs were defeated by the Dakhovsky regiment of the Russian Army. On March 25, 1864, the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of Caucasian War was proclaimed at Kbaade tract (modern Krasnaya Polyana) on June 2 (21 May O.S.), 1864, by the manifesto of Emperor Alexander II read aloud by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia.After the end of Caucasian War (during the period of 1864\u20131870) almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the Shapsugs, who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed in the Circassian Genocide or expelled to the Ottoman Empire (see Circassian Genocide). Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia.In 1874\u20131891, the first Russian Orthodox church, St. Michael's Church, was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed Dakhovsky Posad on April 13, 1874 (O.S.). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky Posad was renamed Sochi Posad (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed Black Sea Governorate. In 1900\u20131910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, \"Kavkazskaya Riviera\", opened on June 14, 1909 (O.S.). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Soviet time ===\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the littoral area saw sporadic armed clashes involving the Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev's Constructivist Institute of Rheumatology (1927\u20131931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Modern Russia ===\nFollowing Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimean Peninsula (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a Greater Sochi which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGreater Sochi is elongated along the Black Sea coast for 145 kilometers (90 mi). Sochi is approximately 1,603 kilometers (996 mi) from Moscow.The city of Sochi borders with Tuapsinsky District in the northwest, with Apsheronsky District and with Maykopsky District of the Republic of Adygea in the north, with Mostovsky District in the northeast, and with Georgia/Abkhazia in the southeast. From the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea.\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are Lazarevskoye, Loo, Dagomys, central Sochi (Tsentralny City District), Khosta, Matsesta, and Adler. The whole city is located on the slopes of the Western Caucasus which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the Mzymta, which is in fact the longest Black Sea tributary in Russia, and the Shakhe. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the Sochi, the Khosta, and the Matsesta.

Almost the whole area of the Greater Sochi, with the exception of the coast and of the area which belong to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, are included into Sochi National Park.\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters (average 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from December to March and warm summers (average 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) during the day and 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from May to October.\n\n\n=== Layout and landmarks ===\nSochi is unique among larger Russian cities as having some aspects of a subtropical resort. Apart from the scenic Caucasus Mountains, pebble and sand beaches, the city attracts vacation-goers with its subtropical vegetation, numerous parks, monuments, and extravagant Stalinist architecture. About two million people visit Greater Sochi each summer, when the city is home to the annual film festival \"Kinotavr\" and a getaway for Russia's elite.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 2,957 square kilometers (731,000 acres) Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, lies just north from the city. Sochi also has the region's most northerly tea plantations.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), at the lower elevations. Its average annual temperature is 18.4 \u00b0C (65.1 \u00b0F) during the day and 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) at night.

December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperature (of these four months) 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night. Average annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters (67 in). Sochi lies at 8b/9a hardiness zone, so the city supports different types of palm trees. Sochi is situated on the same latitude as Nice but strong cold winds from Asia make winters less warm. In fact, temperatures drop below freezing every winter. The highest temperature recorded was 39.4 \u00b0C (102.9 \u00b0F), on July 30, 2000, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221213.4 \u00b0C (7.9 \u00b0F) on January 25, 1892.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status and city divisions ==\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Krasnaya Polyana) and seventy-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Sochi\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Sochi is incorporated as Sochi Urban Okrug.Sochi is administratively subdivided into four city districts: Tsentralny City District, Lazarevsky City District, Khostinsky City District, and Adlersky City District. Tsentralny City District, comprising the central portion of, is by far the smallest out of four in terms of the area, and the other three have comparable areas, with Lazarevsky City District being the biggest. In terms of the population, Tsentralny City District is approximately twice as big as each of the other three city districts.\n\n\n=== Tsentralny City District ===\n\nTsentralny City District, or central Sochi, covers an area of 32 square kilometers (12 sq mi) and, as of the 2010 Census, has a population of 137,677. The highlights include:\n\nMichael Archangel Cathedral, a diminutive church built in 1873\u20131891 to Kaminsky's designs in order to commemorate the victorious conclusion of the Caucasian War.\nThe red-granite Archangel Column, erected in 2006 in memory of the Russian soldiers fallen in Sochi during the Caucasian War. It is capped by a 7-metre bronze statue of Sochi's patron saint, Michael the Archangel.\nSochi Art Museum occupies a large building with a four-columned portico, completed in 1939. The Neoclassical design is by Ivan Zholtovsky.\nSochi Arboretum, a large botanical garden with tropical trees from many countries, and the Mayors Alle\u00e9\u2014a landscape avenue of palm trees planted by mayors from cities around the world.\nThe Tree of Friendship, a hybrid citrus tree planted in 1934 in the Subtropical Botanic Garden. Since 1940 numerous citrus cultivars from foreign countries have been grafted onto this tree as a token of friendship and peace. The associated Friendship Tree Garden Museum has a collection of 20,000 commemorative presents from around the world.\nThe Winter Theater (1934\u20131937) is another rigorously Neoclassical edifice, surrounded by 88 Corinthian columns, with a pediment bearing the statues of Terpsichore, Melpomene and Thalia, all three cast by Vera Mukhina.\nHall of Organ and Chamber Music. Located centrally in the city of Sochi it conducts organ, symphony, chamber-ensemble, choral, vocal music concerts. All year round the Sochi Symphony Orchestra, local actors of the city art groups, famous Russian and international performers, International Contests Winners and Laureates give concerts here.\nThe Maritime Passenger Terminal (1955) is notable for its distinctive 71-meter-high steepled tower and four statues symbolizing the cardinal points.\nThe Railway Station (1952) is one of the most remarkable buildings of Sochi.\nThe Riviera Park was established by Vasily Alexeyevich Khludov in 1883 in the part of the city which later became known as Khludovskaya. The park is popular with tourists and local residents alike. It has a variety of attractions, including an outcrop of funny statues and a \"glade of friendship\" where magnolia trees were planted by every Soviet cosmonaut, among other notables.\n\n\n=== Lazarevsky City District ===\n\nLazarevsky City District lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people. It is the largest city district by area, covering some 1,744 square kilometers (673 sq mi) and comprising several microdistricts:\n\nLazarevskoye, 59 km (37 mi) from the city center, contains a delphinarium, an old church (1903), and a new church (1999). The settlement was founded as a Russian military outpost in 1839 and was named after Admiral Mikhail Lazarev.\nLoo, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, was once owned by Princes Loov, a noble Abkhazian family. The district contains the ruins of a medieval church, founded in the 8th century, rebuilt in the 11th century, and converted into a fortress in the Late Middle Ages.\nDagomys, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, has been noted for its botanical garden, established by order of Nicholas II, as well as tea plantations and factories. A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins Bocharov Ruchey, a dacha built for Kliment Voroshilov in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the President of Russia, where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.\nGolovinka is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the Ubykhs and the Shapsugs, the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the Subashi landing of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted Decembrists used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the Crimean War, so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.\nFort Godlik, of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the Khazars and revived by the Genoese in the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Khostinsky City District ===\n\nKhostinsky City District, sprawling to the southeast from the city center, occupies approximately 374 square kilometers (144 sq mi), with a population of 65,229 as of the 2010 Census. The district is traversed by many rivulets which give their names to the microdistricts of Matsesta (\"flame-colored river\"), Kudepsta, and Khosta (\"the river of boars\").\n\n\n=== Adlersky City District ===\n\nAdlersky City District, with an area of 1,352 square kilometers (522 sq mi) and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census, is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient Sadz village and a medieval Genoese trading post.\nAmong the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation from about 30,000 years ago. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages (auls), the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nAlso located here are the largest trout fishery in Russia (founded in 1964) and a breeding nursery for great apes.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%).\nThe city is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi's Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey's northeastern Black Sea coast who came in the late 19th century and on. The rest are Armenians from Georgia (particularly from Abkhazia and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Armenia (especially from Shirak Province due to the 1988 earthquake).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Sochi region in the Middle Ages. The region was relatively isolated before 1829. In the North, a few hundred Sunni Muslim Shapsugs, a part of the Circassian nation, lived around Tkhagapsh, near Lazarevskoye. The Circassians (also known as Adyghe) converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread to the region.Currently, Sochi is a large predominantly Christian city, though there are thought to be around 20,000 Muslims (5% of inhabitants) living there now (the majority are Adyghe) plus other Eastern Caucasians, Turks, Tatars, and other smaller Muslim groups.A mosque was built in 2008 by United Arab Emirates in the central area of Bytkha, in addition to the old mosque being around 40 km (25 miles) north of the city center in the Adyghe aul of Tkhagapsh.\nThere are around thirty Russian Orthodox churches, the largest being St. Michael's, and two monasteries, plus two Catholic churches, one in the center of Sochi and the other in Lazarevskoye. The Armenian community, which is important in Sochi, gathers in about ten churches.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSochi is home to the following high educational institutions (masters level degree and PhD):  Sochi State University, Russian International Innovative University, and Russian International Olympic University.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\nSochi is also known for its sport facilities: a local tennis school spawned the careers of such notable players as Grand Slam champions Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Kafelnikov spent much of his childhood here, while Sharapova relocated to Florida at the age of seven). In late 2005, the Russian Football Union announced that it was planning to establish a year-round training center for the country's national teams in Sochi. The city's warm climate was cited as one of the main incentives. Sochi is also the home for the football team PFC Sochi which plays in the Russian Premier League and for the ice hockey team HC Sochi which plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\n\n=== 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===\n\nThe nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor at Krasnaya Polyana was the location of the alpine and Nordic events for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nIn June 2006, the International Olympic Committee announced that Sochi had been selected as a finalist city to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On July 4, 2007, Sochi was announced as the host city of the 2014 Winter Games, edging out Pyeongchang, South Korea and Salzburg, Austria.This was Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The site of a training centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi saw concern and controversy following a new federal law approved in Russia in June 2013 that bans \"homosexual propaganda to minors\". There were also concerns over Islamist militants.\n\n\n==== Construction work ====\n\nThe state-controlled RAO UES announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30 billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014. The power generating companies Inter RAO UES and RusHydro would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants\u2014and the federal grid company FGC UES has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW\u2014of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. \"The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6 billion rubles (about US $3.26 billion), of which 50 billion rubles (about US$2 billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid,\" the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8 billion rubles (about US$1.9 billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38 billion roubles (about US$1.48 billion) of that.\n\n\n=== Other sports events ===\n\nThe Silk Way Rally which is part of Dakar series took place in Sochi in 2010 for the last stage between the capital of the Republic of Adygea Maykop to the city of Sochi through Pseshwap.President Vladimir Putin reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone for the city to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix from 2014.The World Robot Olympiad took place in the Adler Arena Skating Center on November 21\u201323, 2014.\nThe 2014 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen was played in Sochi in November 2014, with Carlsen emerging as the winner.\nThe Fisht Olympic Stadium was also used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches.\nSince 2014, the city has hosted HC Sochi, who play at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in the Kontinental Hockey League, the biggest ice hockey league in Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nPublic transport is represented mainly by bus and taxi. Sochi is served by the Adler-Sochi International Airport. Types of non-mass public transport include two funiculars (at the Central military sanatorium and Ordzhonikidze resort) and three cable cars (at arboretum sanatorium \"Dawn\" and pension \"Neva\") also has several cableways in Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe Sochi Port terminal building was built in 1955 by Karo Alabyan and Leonid Karlik in Stalinist architecture. It is topped with a 71-meter steepled tower. Sculptures embodying seasons and cardinal points are set above the tower's three tiers.\nFive of the railway stations of Sochi were renovated for the 2014 Winter Olympics. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta and Khosta railway stations. In Adler city district of Sochi, the original railway station was preserved and new railway station was built near it.

          "The place is in a large tourist park called the Riviera Park, it is air conditioned and pleasant, not very large. There are types of fish and animals in beautiful and rare waters, the tour is circular and the time to go through it takes about seven or eight minutes.",
          "Not worth it.",

          "A small oceanarium. It is better to visit with a complex ticket at the same time as the dolphinarium. The latter left super positive emotions.\n\n",

          "The oceanarium is more precisely only called that, in fact it is a dozen small aquariums. You can only visit in a complex ticket, I do not advise paying only for the sake of this aquarium. There is very little space, \u2026",

          "I really liked the program for both children and adults. There's nothing to do in the penguin. There are 3 pools with 4 penguins. But a contact zoo is worth a visit. There are many living rabbits everywhere. They jump \u2026",

          "A very beautiful sight! If you like to look at the fountains you will definitely like it. Water flies up, maybe twenty meters, or maybe higher, and all this with multi-colored illumination from below. Classical music \u2026",
          "A good light show, especially since it was combined with a freestyle show and with the festival of stars of Russian radio! By time, the duration of the presentation was increased. But it was possible to shift the \u2026",

          "The game of water (pump-guns), coupled with light effects, taking into account the technical progress is wonderful! The sound quality does not reach the ideal. The repertoire is normal, diverse. For a one-time visit \u2026",
          "Beautiful, but once I think, the second time I would not go. Very few shops, nowhere to sit down, the show has to be watched standing. Request to the organizers, add more fun music, all the same show.\n\n",
          "Very beautiful show, beautiful fountains, with great power raising to the incredible height of the water columns. High-quality acoustics, everything is perfectly audible in a large open space.\nIn general, it is \u2026",

          "Very interesting. Beginning in winter at 18.00\n\n",
          "The sound is disgusting in quality. And the fountains for such a large-scale and iconic place are rather weak. In the same Krasnodar, they are much cooler and prettier. And there was no Olympiad.\nSo have fun for the \u2026",

          "The scale of the construction is impressive, taking a walk with the kids is great, going around all the sites is great. Requires cosmetic repairs.\n\n",
          "For the first time, a very exciting sight. Watch definitely worth it.\n\n",
          "Very beautiful show. With transport trouble. To normally leave for Sochi, you need to wait until the break after the first separation and then stomp to the exit.\n\n",
          "Beauty is unreal. It is worth a look. A fountain that builds up to 70 m high, to classical and modern music.\n\n",
          "Very grandiose construction, sensations like on another planet. Under the well-known musical works, fountains release jets to a height of 50 meters and this is still alternated by professionally selected light lights. \u2026",
          "Beautiful, interesting, the first 10-15 minutes, then you realize that you will not see anything new - monotonous illumination and movement of fountains. I noticed that 10-15% of viewers start leaving in 15 minutes, I \u2026",

          "You should definitely look at it if you have not seen it yet. We enjoyed cycling around the Olympic Park!\n\n",
          "Cool place for evening walks! Fountains are open daily, at 8 pm. A large number of people are gathering.\n\n",

          "Like last summer is beautiful. Programs change. Go see the course is worth it. It is amazing how all this is thought out in terms of the performance itself, but more even in technical terms. Fountains are not small, \u2026",
          "In fact, nothing impressive, music plus a large equalizer from the water, and the show begins only in the late evening - the rest of the time it doesn\u2019t even look like a fountain, no water. You can come ride a scooter \u2026",
          "This huge round square, which is worth visiting and in the afternoon carefully looking at the wall with our Champions, and in the evening the color-singing performance of classical Music and Water, captivates the \u2026",

          "Fascinating, grand spectacle. The show starts at 8 pm and lasts a full hour. We watched the fountain dances to the songs of Muslim Magomayev, classical music, M. Jackson, S. Lazarev and others to the last drop. Thanks \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Bolshoy Ice Dome (Russian: \u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u041b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446) is a multi-purpose indoor arena located in Olympic Park, Sochi, Russia. Opened in 2012, the 12,000-seat arena was primarily constructed to host hockey competitions during the 2014 Winter Olympics. Following the Games, it became the home arena of HC Sochi, an expansion team of the KHL. The arena has also hosted concerts and other events. Prior to the Games, the arena hosted the IIHF World U18 Championships and Channel One Cup in 2013.\nThe arena's exterior is distinguished by its LED-illuminated roof, which its designers described as resembling faberg\u00e9 eggs and frozen water droplets\n\n\n== Name and location ==\nThe arena was named \"Bolshoy\", meaning \"big\", \"large\" and \"huge\" in Russian.  This highlights the integral role of ice hockey at the Olympics, which has been dubbed \"the most popular sport\" of the Games by the organizers themselves.  Furthermore, the name was chosen due to its universal familiarity in other countries, in addition to its allusion to the Bolshoi Theatre, Bolshoi Ballet, and other great Russian accomplishments.The Ice Dome was situated in the Coastal Cluster zone of venues for the 2014 Winter Olympics.  It served as the main arena for the men and women's ice hockey tournament throughout the Games.  It is the only venue in the Olympic Park located on top of a hill, and is less than 1,000 feet (300 m) away from Shayba Arena, which was the secondary ice hockey venue that hosted mainly preliminary round matches.\n\n\n== Structure and facilities ==\n\nThe construction of the Bolshoy Ice Dome started in 2009 and finished in 2012.  It was designed by architect firm Mostovik and completed at a cost of approximately US$180 million, although ITAR-TASS estimated the cost to be as high as $300 million.  A total of 20 architects and 70 engineers \u2013 headed by Andrey Ustinov \u2013 were responsible for the construction of the arena. The building was the only Olympic Facility to achieve BREEAM Green Certification in time for the games, achieving the prestigious \"very good\" rating.  The team to achieve this was led by Charles Goddard, Mostovik's International Certification Director.\n\nThe exterior structure of the Ice Dome was designed to resemble a frozen ice droplet.  It has also drawn comparisons to a Faberg\u00e9 egg, due to the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) resembling the \"jewel-encrusted surface\" of the famous Russian art piece.  Ustinov confirmed that the building was designed to be \"a combination of both.\"  The roof of the dome is mostly silver in colour and is covered with aluminium panels.  It is decorated with 38,000 LED lights which illuminate the outside of the arena at night.  The roof also doubles as a scoreboard that displays the live score of the game being played inside and an animation of a hockey puck whenever a goal is scored.  However, it famously did not display the final score after the United States defeated the hosts Russia 3\u20132 in an overtime shootout during the 2014 Winter Olympics.In the arena's interior, the 12,000 seats are arranged in bowl-like configuration.  The concourse features 35,000 square feet (3,300 m2) of glazed glass, which enables spectators to have a view of the Caucasus Mountains.  The hockey rink's dimensions are 60 metres (200 ft) \u00d7 30 metres (98 ft), in line with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) specifications.  This contrasts with the dimensions of the previous Olympics, which utilized National Hockey League (NHL) sized rinks that are 4 metres (13 ft) narrower in width.  It contains 12 dressing rooms for players, an entry tunnel that can be accessed by large vehicles, and a practice ice rink.  Moreover, the Ice Dome uses heat transfer fluids on the ice and in the air conditioning system.  This helps to preserve the quality of the ice, as well as moderate the temperature within the arena so that spectators are kept warm while maintaining the coolness of the ice.  These technologies \u2013 along with the arena's insulation \u2013 were developed by the Dow Chemical Company, one of the official sponsors of the Olympic Games.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\nIn order to test the arenas built for the Olympics, the Bolshoy Ice Dome served as one of the venues for the 2013 IIHF World U18 Championships.  It subsequently held the Channel One Cup from 19\u201322 December 2013 in final preparation before the start of the Games.  As the main venue for the 2014 Olympic ice hockey competition, the Ice Dome hosted most of the preliminary round games and almost all the playoff round matches for the men's tournament, while hosting solely the medal matches of the women's tournament.  On February 20, it held the gold medal match for the women's tournament, which saw Canada overcome a 0\u20132 deficit against the United States to tie the game with less than a minute of regulation time remaining, before scoring in overtime to secure their fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal.  The arena hosted the gold medal game of the men's tournament three days later on 23 February \u2013 the final gold medal of the 2014 Games up for contention \u2013 in which Canada defeated Sweden by a score of 3\u20130.  In doing so, the Canadian team won an Olympic gold medal outside of North America for the first time in 62 years, became the first team since the Soviet Union in 1984 to finish the tournament with a perfect record, the first team to successfully defend their gold medal since the Soviets in 1988, and the first to do both with the participation of NHL players, which started in 1998.The venue hosted the 2015 Kontinental Hockey League All-Star Game. The arena also hosted the first edition of the VTB United Basketball League All-Star Game.\n\n\n== After the Olympics ==\nAfter the conclusion of the Olympics, the arena continue to host a variety of sports, in addition to becoming an entertainment centre and concert venue.  The arena now hosts HC Sochi, a KHL expansion team.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIce Dome Bolshoy General information and images\nBolshoy ice dome lights up sochi 2014 winter olympicsInformation and images\nBig Ice Hockey Arena Information and images\nVenue Models from Sochi Investment Forum 2009\nArena information and drawings\nArena information",

        "wiki": "Sochi (Russian: \u0421\u043e\u0301\u0447\u0438, IPA: [\u02c8sot\u0255\u026a] (listen)) is a city in Krasnodar Krai. It is located in Western Russia, on the Black Sea coast near Russia's southern border. The Greater Sochi area, which includes territories and localities subordinated to Sochi proper, has a total area of 3,526 square kilometers (1,361 sq mi) and sprawls for 145 kilometers (90 mi) along the shores of the Black Sea near the Caucasus Mountains. The area of the city proper is 176.77 square kilometers (68.25 sq mi). According to the 2010 Census, the city had a permanent population of 343,334, up from 328,809 recorded in the 2002 Census, making it Russia's largest resort city. Being part of the Caucasian Riviera, it is one of the very few places in Russia with a subtropical climate, with warm to hot summers and mild winters.\nWith the alpine and Nordic events held at the nearby ski resort of Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi hosted the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, as well as the Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix from 2014 until at least 2020. It was also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore the whole area was conquered by Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian invaders, the Zygii people lived in Lesser Abkhazia under the Kingdom of Pontus, then the Roman Empire's influence in antiquity. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of Lazica and Abkhazia, who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was unified under the single Georgian monarchy in 11th-century, forming one of the Saeristavo, known as Tskhumi extending its possessions up to Nicopsis. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading Alans, Khazars, Mongols and other nomadic empires whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century Byzantine basilica still stands in the Loo Microdistrict.From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi known as Ubykhia was part of historical Circassia, and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, which was their principal trading partner in the Muslim world.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nThe coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Caucasian War and the Russo-Turkish War, 1828\u20131829; however, the Circassians did not admit the Russian control over Circassia and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the Circassian coast (Adyghe: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044b \u0430\u0443\u0448\u0443). Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the Russian Empire and the British Empire that occurred in 1836 over the mission of the Vixen.The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron Feodor Tornau investigated the coastal route from Gelendzhik to Gagra, and across the mountains to Kabarda, in the 1830s. In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the Sochi River as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky in order to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on Cape Adler soon after.\nThe last battle of the Caucasian War took place at the Godlikh river on March 18, 1864 O.S., where the Ubykhs were defeated by the Dakhovsky regiment of the Russian Army. On March 25, 1864, the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of Caucasian War was proclaimed at Kbaade tract (modern Krasnaya Polyana) on June 2 (21 May O.S.), 1864, by the manifesto of Emperor Alexander II read aloud by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia.After the end of Caucasian War (during the period of 1864\u20131870) almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the Shapsugs, who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed in the Circassian Genocide or expelled to the Ottoman Empire (see Circassian Genocide). Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia.In 1874\u20131891, the first Russian Orthodox church, St. Michael's Church, was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed Dakhovsky Posad on April 13, 1874 (O.S.). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky Posad was renamed Sochi Posad (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed Black Sea Governorate. In 1900\u20131910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, \"Kavkazskaya Riviera\", opened on June 14, 1909 (O.S.). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Soviet time ===\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the littoral area saw sporadic armed clashes involving the Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev's Constructivist Institute of Rheumatology (1927\u20131931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Modern Russia ===\nFollowing Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimean Peninsula (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a Greater Sochi which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGreater Sochi is elongated along the Black Sea coast for 145 kilometers (90 mi). Sochi is approximately 1,603 kilometers (996 mi) from Moscow.The city of Sochi borders with Tuapsinsky District in the northwest, with Apsheronsky District and with Maykopsky District of the Republic of Adygea in the north, with Mostovsky District in the northeast, and with Georgia/Abkhazia in the southeast. From the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea.\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are Lazarevskoye, Loo, Dagomys, central Sochi (Tsentralny City District), Khosta, Matsesta, and Adler. The whole city is located on the slopes of the Western Caucasus which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the Mzymta, which is in fact the longest Black Sea tributary in Russia, and the Shakhe. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the Sochi, the Khosta, and the Matsesta. The Psou River makes the border with Abkhazia.\nThe northeastern part of the city belongs to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve which is a World Heritage Site spanning vast areas in Krasnodar Krai and Adygea. Almost the whole area of the Greater Sochi, with the exception of the coast and of the area which belong to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, are included into Sochi National Park.\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters (average 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from December to March and warm summers (average 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) during the day and 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from May to October.\n\n\n=== Layout and landmarks ===\nSochi is unique among larger Russian cities as having some aspects of a subtropical resort. Apart from the scenic Caucasus Mountains, pebble and sand beaches, the city attracts vacation-goers with its subtropical vegetation, numerous parks, monuments, and extravagant Stalinist architecture. About two million people visit Greater Sochi each summer, when the city is home to the annual film festival \"Kinotavr\" and a getaway for Russia's elite.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 2,957 square kilometers (731,000 acres) Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, lies just north from the city. Sochi also has the region's most northerly tea plantations.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), at the lower elevations. Its average annual temperature is 18.4 \u00b0C (65.1 \u00b0F) during the day and 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) at night. In the coldest months\u2014January and February\u2014the average temperature is about 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) during the day, above 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). In the warmest months\u2014July and August\u2014the temperature typically ranges from 25 to 29 \u00b0C (77 to 84 \u00b0F) during the day, about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 23\u201324 \u00b0C (73\u201375 \u00b0F). Yearly sunshine hours are around 2,200. Generally, the summer season lasts four months, from June to September. Two months\u2014April and November\u2014are transitional; sometimes temperatures reach 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with an average temperature of around 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) during the day and 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at night. December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperature (of these four months) 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night. Average annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters (67 in). Sochi lies at 8b/9a hardiness zone, so the city supports different types of palm trees. Sochi is situated on the same latitude as Nice but strong cold winds from Asia make winters less warm. In fact, temperatures drop below freezing every winter. The highest temperature recorded was 39.4 \u00b0C (102.9 \u00b0F), on July 30, 2000, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221213.4 \u00b0C (7.9 \u00b0F) on January 25, 1892.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status and city divisions ==\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Krasnaya Polyana) and seventy-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Sochi\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Sochi is incorporated as Sochi Urban Okrug.Sochi is administratively subdivided into four city districts: Tsentralny City District, Lazarevsky City District, Khostinsky City District, and Adlersky City District. Tsentralny City District, comprising the central portion of, is by far the smallest out of four in terms of the area, and the other three have comparable areas, with Lazarevsky City District being the biggest. In terms of the population, Tsentralny City District is approximately twice as big as each of the other three city districts.\n\n\n=== Tsentralny City District ===\n\nTsentralny City District, or central Sochi, covers an area of 32 square kilometers (12 sq mi) and, as of the 2010 Census, has a population of 137,677. The highlights include:\n\nMichael Archangel Cathedral, a diminutive church built in 1873\u20131891 to Kaminsky's designs in order to commemorate the victorious conclusion of the Caucasian War.\nThe red-granite Archangel Column, erected in 2006 in memory of the Russian soldiers fallen in Sochi during the Caucasian War. It is capped by a 7-metre bronze statue of Sochi's patron saint, Michael the Archangel.\nSochi Art Museum occupies a large building with a four-columned portico, completed in 1939. The Neoclassical design is by Ivan Zholtovsky.\nSochi Arboretum, a large botanical garden with tropical trees from many countries, and the Mayors Alle\u00e9\u2014a landscape avenue of palm trees planted by mayors from cities around the world.\nThe Tree of Friendship, a hybrid citrus tree planted in 1934 in the Subtropical Botanic Garden. Since 1940 numerous citrus cultivars from foreign countries have been grafted onto this tree as a token of friendship and peace. The associated Friendship Tree Garden Museum has a collection of 20,000 commemorative presents from around the world.\nThe Winter Theater (1934\u20131937) is another rigorously Neoclassical edifice, surrounded by 88 Corinthian columns, with a pediment bearing the statues of Terpsichore, Melpomene and Thalia, all three cast by Vera Mukhina.\nHall of Organ and Chamber Music. Located centrally in the city of Sochi it conducts organ, symphony, chamber-ensemble, choral, vocal music concerts. All year round the Sochi Symphony Orchestra, local actors of the city art groups, famous Russian and international performers, International Contests Winners and Laureates give concerts here.\nThe Maritime Passenger Terminal (1955) is notable for its distinctive 71-meter-high steepled tower and four statues symbolizing the cardinal points.\nThe Railway Station (1952) is one of the most remarkable buildings of Sochi.\nThe Riviera Park was established by Vasily Alexeyevich Khludov in 1883 in the part of the city which later became known as Khludovskaya. The park is popular with tourists and local residents alike. It has a variety of attractions, including an outcrop of funny statues and a \"glade of friendship\" where magnolia trees were planted by every Soviet cosmonaut, among other notables.\n\n\n=== Lazarevsky City District ===\n\nLazarevsky City District lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people. It is the largest city district by area, covering some 1,744 square kilometers (673 sq mi) and comprising several microdistricts:\n\nLazarevskoye, 59 km (37 mi) from the city center, contains a delphinarium, an old church (1903), and a new church (1999). The settlement was founded as a Russian military outpost in 1839 and was named after Admiral Mikhail Lazarev.\nLoo, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, was once owned by Princes Loov, a noble Abkhazian family. The district contains the ruins of a medieval church, founded in the 8th century, rebuilt in the 11th century, and converted into a fortress in the Late Middle Ages.\nDagomys, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, has been noted for its botanical garden, established by order of Nicholas II, as well as tea plantations and factories. A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins Bocharov Ruchey, a dacha built for Kliment Voroshilov in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the President of Russia, where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.\nGolovinka is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the Ubykhs and the Shapsugs, the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the Subashi landing of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted Decembrists used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the Crimean War, so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.\nFort Godlik, of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the Khazars and revived by the Genoese in the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Khostinsky City District ===\n\nKhostinsky City District, sprawling to the southeast from the city center, occupies approximately 374 square kilometers (144 sq mi), with a population of 65,229 as of the 2010 Census. The district is traversed by many rivulets which give their names to the microdistricts of Matsesta (\"flame-colored river\"), Kudepsta, and Khosta (\"the river of boars\").\n\n\n=== Adlersky City District ===\n\nAdlersky City District, with an area of 1,352 square kilometers (522 sq mi) and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census, is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient Sadz village and a medieval Genoese trading post.\nAmong the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation from about 30,000 years ago. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages (auls), the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nAlso located here are the largest trout fishery in Russia (founded in 1964) and a breeding nursery for great apes.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%).\nThe city is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi's Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey's northeastern Black Sea coast who came in the late 19th century and on. The rest are Armenians from Georgia (particularly from Abkhazia and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Armenia (especially from Shirak Province due to the 1988 earthquake).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Sochi region in the Middle Ages. The region was relatively isolated before 1829. In the North, a few hundred Sunni Muslim Shapsugs, a part of the Circassian nation, lived around Tkhagapsh, near Lazarevskoye. The Circassians (also known as Adyghe) converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread to the region.Currently, Sochi is a large predominantly Christian city, though there are thought to be around 20,000 Muslims (5% of inhabitants) living there now (the majority are Adyghe) plus other Eastern Caucasians, Turks, Tatars, and other smaller Muslim groups.A mosque was built in 2008 by United Arab Emirates in the central area of Bytkha, in addition to the old mosque being around 40 km (25 miles) north of the city center in the Adyghe aul of Tkhagapsh.\nThere are around thirty Russian Orthodox churches, the largest being St. Michael's, and two monasteries, plus two Catholic churches, one in the center of Sochi and the other in Lazarevskoye. The Armenian community, which is important in Sochi, gathers in about ten churches.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSochi is home to the following high educational institutions (masters level degree and PhD):  Sochi State University, Russian International Innovative University, and Russian International Olympic University.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\nSochi is also known for its sport facilities: a local tennis school spawned the careers of such notable players as Grand Slam champions Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Kafelnikov spent much of his childhood here, while Sharapova relocated to Florida at the age of seven). In late 2005, the Russian Football Union announced that it was planning to establish a year-round training center for the country's national teams in Sochi. The city's warm climate was cited as one of the main incentives. Sochi is also the home for the football team PFC Sochi which plays in the Russian Premier League and for the ice hockey team HC Sochi which plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\n\n=== 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===\n\nThe nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor at Krasnaya Polyana was the location of the alpine and Nordic events for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nIn June 2006, the International Olympic Committee announced that Sochi had been selected as a finalist city to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On July 4, 2007, Sochi was announced as the host city of the 2014 Winter Games, edging out Pyeongchang, South Korea and Salzburg, Austria.This was Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The site of a training centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi saw concern and controversy following a new federal law approved in Russia in June 2013 that bans \"homosexual propaganda to minors\". There were also concerns over Islamist militants.\n\n\n==== Construction work ====\n\nThe state-controlled RAO UES announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30 billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014. The power generating companies Inter RAO UES and RusHydro would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants\u2014and the federal grid company FGC UES has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW\u2014of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. \"The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6 billion rubles (about US $3.26 billion), of which 50 billion rubles (about US$2 billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid,\" the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8 billion rubles (about US$1.9 billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38 billion roubles (about US$1.48 billion) of that.\n\n\n=== Other sports events ===\n\nThe Silk Way Rally which is part of Dakar series took place in Sochi in 2010 for the last stage between the capital of the Republic of Adygea Maykop to the city of Sochi through Pseshwap.President Vladimir Putin reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone for the city to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix from 2014.The World Robot Olympiad took place in the Adler Arena Skating Center on November 21\u201323, 2014.\nThe 2014 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen was played in Sochi in November 2014, with Carlsen emerging as the winner.\nThe Fisht Olympic Stadium was also used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches.\nSince 2014, the city has hosted HC Sochi, who play at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in the Kontinental Hockey League, the biggest ice hockey league in Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nPublic transport is represented mainly by bus and taxi. Sochi is served by the Adler-Sochi International Airport. Types of non-mass public transport include two funiculars (at the Central military sanatorium and Ordzhonikidze resort) and three cable cars (at arboretum sanatorium \"Dawn\" and pension \"Neva\") also has several cableways in Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe Sochi Port terminal building was built in 1955 by Karo Alabyan and Leonid Karlik in Stalinist architecture. It is topped with a 71-meter steepled tower. Sculptures embodying seasons and cardinal points are set above the tower's three tiers.\nFive of the railway stations of Sochi were renovated for the 2014 Winter Olympics. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta and Khosta railway stations. In Adler city district of Sochi, the original railway station was preserved and new railway station was built near it.

        "wiki": "Sochi (Russian: \u0421\u043e\u0301\u0447\u0438, IPA: [\u02c8sot\u0255\u026a] (listen)) is a city in Krasnodar Krai. It is located in Western Russia, on the Black Sea coast near Russia's southern border. The Greater Sochi area, which includes territories and localities subordinated to Sochi proper, has a total area of 3,526 square kilometers (1,361 sq mi) and sprawls for 145 kilometers (90 mi) along the shores of the Black Sea near the Caucasus Mountains. The area of the city proper is 176.77 square kilometers (68.25 sq mi). According to the 2010 Census, the city had a permanent population of 343,334, up from 328,809 recorded in the 2002 Census, making it Russia's largest resort city. Being part of the Caucasian Riviera, it is one of the very few places in Russia with a subtropical climate, with warm to hot summers and mild winters.\nWith the alpine and Nordic events held at the nearby ski resort of Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi hosted the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, as well as the Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix from 2014 until at least 2020. It was also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore the whole area was conquered by Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian invaders, the Zygii people lived in Lesser Abkhazia under the Kingdom of Pontus, then the Roman Empire's influence in antiquity. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of Lazica and Abkhazia, who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was unified under the single Georgian monarchy in 11th-century, forming one of the Saeristavo, known as Tskhumi extending its possessions up to Nicopsis. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading Alans, Khazars, Mongols and other nomadic empires whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century Byzantine basilica still stands in the Loo Microdistrict.From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi known as Ubykhia was part of historical Circassia, and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, which was their principal trading partner in the Muslim world.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nThe coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Caucasian War and the Russo-Turkish War, 1828\u20131829; however, the Circassians did not admit the Russian control over Circassia and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the Circassian coast (Adyghe: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044b \u0430\u0443\u0448\u0443). Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the Russian Empire and the British Empire that occurred in 1836 over the mission of the Vixen.The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron Feodor Tornau investigated the coastal route from Gelendzhik to Gagra, and across the mountains to Kabarda, in the 1830s. In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the Sochi River as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky in order to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on Cape Adler soon after.\nThe last battle of the Caucasian War took place at the Godlikh river on March 18, 1864 O.S., where the Ubykhs were defeated by the Dakhovsky regiment of the Russian Army. On March 25, 1864, the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of Caucasian War was proclaimed at Kbaade tract (modern Krasnaya Polyana) on June 2 (21 May O.S.), 1864, by the manifesto of Emperor Alexander II read aloud by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia.After the end of Caucasian War (during the period of 1864\u20131870) almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the Shapsugs, who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed in the Circassian Genocide or expelled to the Ottoman Empire (see Circassian Genocide). Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia.In 1874\u20131891, the first Russian Orthodox church, St. Michael's Church, was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed Dakhovsky Posad on April 13, 1874 (O.S.). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky Posad was renamed Sochi Posad (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed Black Sea Governorate. In 1900\u20131910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, \"Kavkazskaya Riviera\", opened on June 14, 1909 (O.S.). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Soviet time ===\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the littoral area saw sporadic armed clashes involving the Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev's Constructivist Institute of Rheumatology (1927\u20131931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Modern Russia ===\nFollowing Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimean Peninsula (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a Greater Sochi which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGreater Sochi is elongated along the Black Sea coast for 145 kilometers (90 mi). Sochi is approximately 1,603 kilometers (996 mi) from Moscow.The city of Sochi borders with Tuapsinsky District in the northwest, with Apsheronsky District and with Maykopsky District of the Republic of Adygea in the north, with Mostovsky District in the northeast, and with Georgia/Abkhazia in the southeast. From the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea.\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are Lazarevskoye, Loo, Dagomys, central Sochi (Tsentralny City District), Khosta, Matsesta, and Adler. The whole city is located on the slopes of the Western Caucasus which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the Mzymta, which is in fact the longest Black Sea tributary in Russia, and the Shakhe. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the Sochi, the Khosta, and the Matsesta. The Psou River makes the border with Abkhazia.\nThe northeastern part of the city belongs to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve which is a World Heritage Site spanning vast areas in Krasnodar Krai and Adygea. Almost the whole area of the Greater Sochi, with the exception of the coast and of the area which belong to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, are included into Sochi National Park.\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters (average 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from December to March and warm summers (average 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) during the day and 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from May to October.\n\n\n=== Layout and landmarks ===\nSochi is unique among larger Russian cities as having some aspects of a subtropical resort. Apart from the scenic Caucasus Mountains, pebble and sand beaches, the city attracts vacation-goers with its subtropical vegetation, numerous parks, monuments, and extravagant Stalinist architecture. About two million people visit Greater Sochi each summer, when the city is home to the annual film festival \"Kinotavr\" and a getaway for Russia's elite.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 2,957 square kilometers (731,000 acres) Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, lies just north from the city. Sochi also has the region's most northerly tea plantations.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), at the lower elevations. Its average annual temperature is 18.4 \u00b0C (65.1 \u00b0F) during the day and 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) at night. In the coldest months\u2014January and February\u2014the average temperature is about 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) during the day, above 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). In the warmest months\u2014July and August\u2014the temperature typically ranges from 25 to 29 \u00b0C (77 to 84 \u00b0F) during the day, about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 23\u201324 \u00b0C (73\u201375 \u00b0F). Yearly sunshine hours are around 2,200. Generally, the summer season lasts four months, from June to September. Two months\u2014April and November\u2014are transitional; sometimes temperatures reach 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with an average temperature of around 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) during the day and 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at night. December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperature (of these four months) 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night. Average annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters (67 in). Sochi lies at 8b/9a hardiness zone, so the city supports different types of palm trees. Sochi is situated on the same latitude as Nice but strong cold winds from Asia make winters less warm. In fact, temperatures drop below freezing every winter. The highest temperature recorded was 39.4 \u00b0C (102.9 \u00b0F), on July 30, 2000, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221213.4 \u00b0C (7.9 \u00b0F) on January 25, 1892.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status and city divisions ==\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Krasnaya Polyana) and seventy-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Sochi\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Sochi is incorporated as Sochi Urban Okrug.Sochi is administratively subdivided into four city districts: Tsentralny City District, Lazarevsky City District, Khostinsky City District, and Adlersky City District. Tsentralny City District, comprising the central portion of, is by far the smallest out of four in terms of the area, and the other three have comparable areas, with Lazarevsky City District being the biggest. In terms of the population, Tsentralny City District is approximately twice as big as each of the other three city districts.\n\n\n=== Tsentralny City District ===\n\nTsentralny City District, or central Sochi, covers an area of 32 square kilometers (12 sq mi) and, as of the 2010 Census, has a population of 137,677. The highlights include:\n\nMichael Archangel Cathedral, a diminutive church built in 1873\u20131891 to Kaminsky's designs in order to commemorate the victorious conclusion of the Caucasian War.\nThe red-granite Archangel Column, erected in 2006 in memory of the Russian soldiers fallen in Sochi during the Caucasian War.

The park is popular with tourists and local residents alike. It has a variety of attractions, including an outcrop of funny statues and a \"glade of friendship\" where magnolia trees were planted by every Soviet cosmonaut, among other notables.\n\n\n=== Lazarevsky City District ===\n\nLazarevsky City District lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people. It is the largest city district by area, covering some 1,744 square kilometers (673 sq mi) and comprising several microdistricts:\n\nLazarevskoye, 59 km (37 mi) from the city center, contains a delphinarium, an old church (1903), and a new church (1999).

A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins Bocharov Ruchey, a dacha built for Kliment Voroshilov in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the President of Russia, where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.\nGolovinka is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the Ubykhs and the Shapsugs, the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the Subashi landing of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted Decembrists used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the Crimean War, so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.\nFort Godlik, of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the Khazars and revived by the Genoese in the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Khostinsky City District ===\n\nKhostinsky City District, sprawling to the southeast from the city center, occupies approximately 374 square kilometers (144 sq mi), with a population of 65,229 as of the 2010 Census. The district is traversed by many rivulets which give their names to the microdistricts of Matsesta (\"flame-colored river\"), Kudepsta, and Khosta (\"the river of boars\").\n\n\n=== Adlersky City District ===\n\nAdlersky City District, with an area of 1,352 square kilometers (522 sq mi) and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census, is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient Sadz village and a medieval Genoese trading post.\nAmong the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation from about 30,000 years ago. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages (auls), the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nAlso located here are the largest trout fishery in Russia (founded in 1964) and a breeding nursery for great apes.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%).\nThe city is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi's Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey's northeastern Black Sea coast who came in the late 19th century and on. The rest are Armenians from Georgia (particularly from Abkhazia and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Armenia (especially from Shirak Province due to the 1988 earthquake).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Sochi region in the Middle Ages. The region was relatively isolated before 1829. In the North, a few hundred Sunni Muslim Shapsugs, a part of the Circassian nation, lived around Tkhagapsh, near Lazarevskoye. The Circassians (also known as Adyghe) converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread to the region.Currently, Sochi is a large predominantly Christian city, though there are thought to be around 20,000 Muslims (5% of inhabitants) living there now (the majority are Adyghe) plus other Eastern Caucasians, Turks, Tatars, and other smaller Muslim groups.A mosque was built in 2008 by United Arab Emirates in the central area of Bytkha, in addition to the old mosque being around 40 km (25 miles) north of the city center in the Adyghe aul of Tkhagapsh.\nThere are around thirty Russian Orthodox churches, the largest being St. Michael's, and two monasteries, plus two Catholic churches, one in the center of Sochi and the other in Lazarevskoye. The Armenian community, which is important in Sochi, gathers in about ten churches.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSochi is home to the following high educational institutions (masters level degree and PhD):  Sochi State University, Russian International Innovative University, and Russian International Olympic University.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\nSochi is also known for its sport facilities: a local tennis school spawned the careers of such notable players as Grand Slam champions Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Kafelnikov spent much of his childhood here, while Sharapova relocated to Florida at the age of seven). In late 2005, the Russian Football Union announced that it was planning to establish a year-round training center for the country's national teams in Sochi. The city's warm climate was cited as one of the main incentives. Sochi is also the home for the football team PFC Sochi which plays in the Russian Premier League and for the ice hockey team HC Sochi which plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\n\n=== 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===\n\nThe nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor at Krasnaya Polyana was the location of the alpine and Nordic events for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nIn June 2006, the International Olympic Committee announced that Sochi had been selected as a finalist city to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On July 4, 2007, Sochi was announced as the host city of the 2014 Winter Games, edging out Pyeongchang, South Korea and Salzburg, Austria.This was Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The site of a training centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi saw concern and controversy following a new federal law approved in Russia in June 2013 that bans \"homosexual propaganda to minors\". There were also concerns over Islamist militants.\n\n\n==== Construction work ====\n\nThe state-controlled RAO UES announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30 billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014. The power generating companies Inter RAO UES and RusHydro would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants\u2014and the federal grid company FGC UES has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW\u2014of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. \"The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6 billion rubles (about US $3.26 billion), of which 50 billion rubles (about US$2 billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid,\" the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8 billion rubles (about US$1.9 billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38 billion roubles (about US$1.48 billion) of that.\n\n\n=== Other sports events ===\n\nThe Silk Way Rally which is part of Dakar series took place in Sochi in 2010 for the last stage between the capital of the Republic of Adygea Maykop to the city of Sochi through Pseshwap.President Vladimir Putin reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone for the city to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix from 2014.The World Robot Olympiad took place in the Adler Arena Skating Center on November 21\u201323, 2014.\nThe 2014 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen was played in Sochi in November 2014, with Carlsen emerging as the winner.\nThe Fisht Olympic Stadium was also used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches.\nSince 2014, the city has hosted HC Sochi, who play at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in the Kontinental Hockey League, the biggest ice hockey league in Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nPublic transport is represented mainly by bus and taxi. Sochi is served by the Adler-Sochi International Airport. Types of non-mass public transport include two funiculars (at the Central military sanatorium and Ordzhonikidze resort) and three cable cars (at arboretum sanatorium \"Dawn\" and pension \"Neva\") also has several cableways in Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe Sochi Port terminal building was built in 1955 by Karo Alabyan and Leonid Karlik in Stalinist architecture. It is topped with a 71-meter steepled tower. Sculptures embodying seasons and cardinal points are set above the tower's three tiers.\nFive of the railway stations of Sochi were renovated for the 2014 Winter Olympics. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta and Khosta railway stations. In Adler city district of Sochi, the original railway station was preserved and new railway station was built near it. Another new railway station was built in Estosadok, close to Krasnaya Polyana.\nAt some point, plans to construct the light metro network to serve the Olympics were considered; however, the Sochi Light Metro plan was abandoned in favor of the reconstruction of the railway.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nYuri Nikolaevich Denisyuk, physicist\nMikhail Galustyan, comedian\nAndre Geim, physicist, graphene researcher and 2010 Nobel Prize winner\nYevgeny Kafelnikov, tennis player, former World No. 1 tennis player\nDaria Kondakova, rhythmic gymnast\nGrigory Leps, singer, songwriter, musician of Georgian origin\nSlava Metreveli, Georgian/Soviet association football player\nVladimir Nemshilov, Olympic swimmer\nBoris Nemtsov, politician\nMordechai Spiegler, Russian-Israeli association football player and manager\nVladimir Tkachenko, basketball player\nElena Vesnina, tennis player\nKharis Yunichev, the first Soviet male swimmer to win an Olympic medal\nAnna Zak, Israeli celebrity\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nSochi is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nFederation Island\nSochi Police\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0432\u0437\u0430\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044e \u0441 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0410\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f. \u0421\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u211634.01-707/13-03 \u043e\u0442 23 \u043c\u0430\u044f 2013 \u0433. \u00ab\u0420\u0435\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f\u00bb.

        "wiki": "Sochi (Russian: \u0421\u043e\u0301\u0447\u0438, IPA: [\u02c8sot\u0255\u026a] (listen)) is a city in Krasnodar Krai. It is located in Western Russia, on the Black Sea coast near Russia's southern border. The Greater Sochi area, which includes territories and localities subordinated to Sochi proper, has a total area of 3,526 square kilometers (1,361 sq mi) and sprawls for 145 kilometers (90 mi) along the shores of the Black Sea near the Caucasus Mountains. The area of the city proper is 176.77 square kilometers (68.25 sq mi). According to the 2010 Census, the city had a permanent population of 343,334, up from 328,809 recorded in the 2002 Census, making it Russia's largest resort city. Being part of the Caucasian Riviera, it is one of the very few places in Russia with a subtropical climate, with warm to hot summers and mild winters.\nWith the alpine and Nordic events held at the nearby ski resort of Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi hosted the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, as well as the Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix from 2014 until at least 2020. It was also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore the whole area was conquered by Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian invaders, the Zygii people lived in Lesser Abkhazia under the Kingdom of Pontus, then the Roman Empire's influence in antiquity. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of Lazica and Abkhazia, who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was unified under the single Georgian monarchy in 11th-century, forming one of the Saeristavo, known as Tskhumi extending its possessions up to Nicopsis. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading Alans, Khazars, Mongols and other nomadic empires whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century Byzantine basilica still stands in the Loo Microdistrict.From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi known as Ubykhia was part of historical Circassia, and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, which was their principal trading partner in the Muslim world.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nThe coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Caucasian War and the Russo-Turkish War, 1828\u20131829; however, the Circassians did not admit the Russian control over Circassia and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the Circassian coast (Adyghe: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044b \u0430\u0443\u0448\u0443). Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the Russian Empire and the British Empire that occurred in 1836 over the mission of the Vixen.The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron Feodor Tornau investigated the coastal route from Gelendzhik to Gagra, and across the mountains to Kabarda, in the 1830s. In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the Sochi River as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky in order to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on Cape Adler soon after.\nThe last battle of the Caucasian War took place at the Godlikh river on March 18, 1864 O.S., where the Ubykhs were defeated by the Dakhovsky regiment of the Russian Army. On March 25, 1864, the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of Caucasian War was proclaimed at Kbaade tract (modern Krasnaya Polyana) on June 2 (21 May O.S.), 1864, by the manifesto of Emperor Alexander II read aloud by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia.After the end of Caucasian War (during the period of 1864\u20131870) almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the Shapsugs, who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed in the Circassian Genocide or expelled to the Ottoman Empire (see Circassian Genocide). Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia.In 1874\u20131891, the first Russian Orthodox church, St. Michael's Church, was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed Dakhovsky Posad on April 13, 1874 (O.S.). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky Posad was renamed Sochi Posad (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed Black Sea Governorate. In 1900\u20131910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, \"Kavkazskaya Riviera\", opened on June 14, 1909 (O.S.). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Soviet time ===\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the littoral area saw sporadic armed clashes involving the Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev's Constructivist Institute of Rheumatology (1927\u20131931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Modern Russia ===\nFollowing Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimean Peninsula (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a Greater Sochi which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGreater Sochi is elongated along the Black Sea coast for 145 kilometers (90 mi). Sochi is approximately 1,603 kilometers (996 mi) from Moscow.The city of Sochi borders with Tuapsinsky District in the northwest, with Apsheronsky District and with Maykopsky District of the Republic of Adygea in the north, with Mostovsky District in the northeast, and with Georgia/Abkhazia in the southeast. From the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea.\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are Lazarevskoye, Loo, Dagomys, central Sochi (Tsentralny City District), Khosta, Matsesta, and Adler. The whole city is located on the slopes of the Western Caucasus which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the Mzymta, which is in fact the longest Black Sea tributary in Russia, and the Shakhe. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the Sochi, the Khosta, and the Matsesta. The Psou River makes the border with Abkhazia.\nThe northeastern part of the city belongs to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve which is a World Heritage Site spanning vast areas in Krasnodar Krai and Adygea. Almost the whole area of the Greater Sochi, with the exception of the coast and of the area which belong to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, are included into Sochi National Park.\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters (average 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from December to March and warm summers (average 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) during the day and 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from May to October.\n\n\n=== Layout and landmarks ===\nSochi is unique among larger Russian cities as having some aspects of a subtropical resort. Apart from the scenic Caucasus Mountains, pebble and sand beaches, the city attracts vacation-goers with its subtropical vegetation, numerous parks, monuments, and extravagant Stalinist architecture. About two million people visit Greater Sochi each summer, when the city is home to the annual film festival \"Kinotavr\" and a getaway for Russia's elite.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 2,957 square kilometers (731,000 acres) Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, lies just north from the city. Sochi also has the region's most northerly tea plantations.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), at the lower elevations. Its average annual temperature is 18.4 \u00b0C (65.1 \u00b0F) during the day and 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) at night. In the coldest months\u2014January and February\u2014the average temperature is about 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) during the day, above 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). In the warmest months\u2014July and August\u2014the temperature typically ranges from 25 to 29 \u00b0C (77 to 84 \u00b0F) during the day, about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 23\u201324 \u00b0C (73\u201375 \u00b0F). Yearly sunshine hours are around 2,200. Generally, the summer season lasts four months, from June to September. Two months\u2014April and November\u2014are transitional; sometimes temperatures reach 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with an average temperature of around 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) during the day and 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at night. December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperature (of these four months) 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night. Average annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters (67 in). Sochi lies at 8b/9a hardiness zone, so the city supports different types of palm trees. Sochi is situated on the same latitude as Nice but strong cold winds from Asia make winters less warm. In fact, temperatures drop below freezing every winter. The highest temperature recorded was 39.4 \u00b0C (102.9 \u00b0F), on July 30, 2000, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221213.4 \u00b0C (7.9 \u00b0F) on January 25, 1892.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status and city divisions ==\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Krasnaya Polyana) and seventy-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Sochi\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Sochi is incorporated as Sochi Urban Okrug.Sochi is administratively subdivided into four city districts: Tsentralny City District, Lazarevsky City District, Khostinsky City District, and Adlersky City District. Tsentralny City District, comprising the central portion of, is by far the smallest out of four in terms of the area, and the other three have comparable areas, with Lazarevsky City District being the biggest. In terms of the population, Tsentralny City District is approximately twice as big as each of the other three city districts.\n\n\n=== Tsentralny City District ===\n\nTsentralny City District, or central Sochi, covers an area of 32 square kilometers (12 sq mi) and, as of the 2010 Census, has a population of 137,677. The highlights include:\n\nMichael Archangel Cathedral, a diminutive church built in 1873\u20131891 to Kaminsky's designs in order to commemorate the victorious conclusion of the Caucasian War.\nThe red-granite Archangel Column, erected in 2006 in memory of the Russian soldiers fallen in Sochi during the Caucasian War. It is capped by a 7-metre bronze statue of Sochi's patron saint, Michael the Archangel.\nSochi Art Museum occupies a large building with a four-columned portico, completed in 1939. The Neoclassical design is by Ivan Zholtovsky.\nSochi Arboretum, a large botanical garden with tropical trees from many countries, and the Mayors Alle\u00e9\u2014a landscape avenue of palm trees planted by mayors from cities around the world.\nThe Tree of Friendship, a hybrid citrus tree planted in 1934 in the Subtropical Botanic Garden. Since 1940 numerous citrus cultivars from foreign countries have been grafted onto this tree as a token of friendship and peace. The associated Friendship Tree Garden Museum has a collection of 20,000 commemorative presents from around the world.\nThe Winter Theater (1934\u20131937) is another rigorously Neoclassical edifice, surrounded by 88 Corinthian columns, with a pediment bearing the statues of Terpsichore, Melpomene and Thalia, all three cast by Vera Mukhina.\nHall of Organ and Chamber Music. Located centrally in the city of Sochi it conducts organ, symphony, chamber-ensemble, choral, vocal music concerts. All year round the Sochi Symphony Orchestra, local actors of the city art groups, famous Russian and international performers, International Contests Winners and Laureates give concerts here.\nThe Maritime Passenger Terminal (1955) is notable for its distinctive 71-meter-high steepled tower and four statues symbolizing the cardinal points.\nThe Railway Station (1952) is one of the most remarkable buildings of Sochi.\nThe Riviera Park was established by Vasily Alexeyevich Khludov in 1883 in the part of the city which later became known as Khludovskaya. The park is popular with tourists and local residents alike. It has a variety of attractions, including an outcrop of funny statues and a \"glade of friendship\" where magnolia trees were planted by every Soviet cosmonaut, among other notables.\n\n\n=== Lazarevsky City District ===\n\nLazarevsky City District lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people. It is the largest city district by area, covering some 1,744 square kilometers (673 sq mi) and comprising several microdistricts:\n\nLazarevskoye, 59 km (37 mi) from the city center, contains a delphinarium, an old church (1903), and a new church (1999). The settlement was founded as a Russian military outpost in 1839 and was named after Admiral Mikhail Lazarev.\nLoo, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, was once owned by Princes Loov, a noble Abkhazian family. The district contains the ruins of a medieval church, founded in the 8th century, rebuilt in the 11th century, and converted into a fortress in the Late Middle Ages.\nDagomys, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, has been noted for its botanical garden, established by order of Nicholas II, as well as tea plantations and factories. A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins Bocharov Ruchey, a dacha built for Kliment Voroshilov in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the President of Russia, where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.\nGolovinka is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the Ubykhs and the Shapsugs, the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the Subashi landing of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted Decembrists used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the Crimean War, so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.\nFort Godlik, of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the Khazars and revived by the Genoese in the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Khostinsky City District ===\n\nKhostinsky City District, sprawling to the southeast from the city center, occupies approximately 374 square kilometers (144 sq mi), with a population of 65,229 as of the 2010 Census. The district is traversed by many rivulets which give their names to the microdistricts of Matsesta (\"flame-colored river\"), Kudepsta, and Khosta (\"the river of boars\").\n\n\n=== Adlersky City District ===\n\nAdlersky City District, with an area of 1,352 square kilometers (522 sq mi) and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census, is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient Sadz village and a medieval Genoese trading post.\nAmong the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation from about 30,000 years ago. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages (auls), the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nAlso located here are the largest trout fishery in Russia (founded in 1964) and a breeding nursery for great apes.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%).\nThe city is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi's Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey's northeastern Black Sea coast who came in the late 19th century and on. The rest are Armenians from Georgia (particularly from Abkhazia and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Armenia (especially from Shirak Province due to the 1988 earthquake).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Sochi region in the Middle Ages. The region was relatively isolated before 1829. In the North, a few hundred Sunni Muslim Shapsugs, a part of the Circassian nation, lived around Tkhagapsh, near Lazarevskoye. The Circassians (also known as Adyghe) converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread to the region.Currently, Sochi is a large predominantly Christian city, though there are thought to be around 20,000 Muslims (5% of inhabitants) living there now (the majority are Adyghe) plus other Eastern Caucasians, Turks, Tatars, and other smaller Muslim groups.A mosque was built in 2008 by United Arab Emirates in the central area of Bytkha, in addition to the old mosque being around 40 km (25 miles) north of the city center in the Adyghe aul of Tkhagapsh.\nThere are around thirty Russian Orthodox churches, the largest being St. Michael's, and two monasteries, plus two Catholic churches, one in the center of Sochi and the other in Lazarevskoye. The Armenian community, which is important in Sochi, gathers in about ten churches.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSochi is home to the following high educational institutions (masters level degree and PhD):  Sochi State University, Russian International Innovative University, and Russian International Olympic University.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\nSochi is also known for its sport facilities: a local tennis school spawned the careers of such notable players as Grand Slam champions Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Kafelnikov spent much of his childhood here, while Sharapova relocated to Florida at the age of seven). In late 2005, the Russian Football Union announced that it was planning to establish a year-round training center for the country's national teams in Sochi. The city's warm climate was cited as one of the main incentives. Sochi is also the home for the football team PFC Sochi which plays in the Russian Premier League and for the ice hockey team HC Sochi which plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\n\n=== 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===\n\nThe nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor at Krasnaya Polyana was the location of the alpine and Nordic events for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nIn June 2006, the International Olympic Committee announced that Sochi had been selected as a finalist city to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On July 4, 2007, Sochi was announced as the host city of the 2014 Winter Games, edging out Pyeongchang, South Korea and Salzburg, Austria.This was Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The site of a training centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi saw concern and controversy following a new federal law approved in Russia in June 2013 that bans \"homosexual propaganda to minors\". There were also concerns over Islamist militants.\n\n\n==== Construction work ====\n\nThe state-controlled RAO UES announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30 billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014. The power generating companies Inter RAO UES and RusHydro would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants\u2014and the federal grid company FGC UES has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW\u2014of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. \"The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6 billion rubles (about US $3.26 billion), of which 50 billion rubles (about US$2 billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid,\" the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8 billion rubles (about US$1.9 billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38 billion roubles (about US$1.48 billion) of that.\n\n\n=== Other sports events ===\n\nThe Silk Way Rally which is part of Dakar series took place in Sochi in 2010 for the last stage between the capital of the Republic of Adygea Maykop to the city of Sochi through Pseshwap.President Vladimir Putin reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone for the city to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix from 2014.The World Robot Olympiad took place in the Adler Arena Skating Center on November 21\u201323, 2014.\nThe 2014 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen was played in Sochi in November 2014, with Carlsen emerging as the winner.\nThe Fisht Olympic Stadium was also used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches.\nSince 2014, the city has hosted HC Sochi, who play at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in the Kontinental Hockey League, the biggest ice hockey league in Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nPublic transport is represented mainly by bus and taxi. Sochi is served by the Adler-Sochi International Airport. Types of non-mass public transport include two funiculars (at the Central military sanatorium and Ordzhonikidze resort) and three cable cars (at arboretum sanatorium \"Dawn\" and pension \"Neva\") also has several cableways in Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe Sochi Port terminal building was built in 1955 by Karo Alabyan and Leonid Karlik in Stalinist architecture. It is topped with a 71-meter steepled tower. Sculptures embodying seasons and cardinal points are set above the tower's three tiers.\nFive of the railway stations of Sochi were renovated for the 2014 Winter Olympics. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta and Khosta railway stations. In Adler city district of Sochi, the original railway station was preserved and new railway station was built near it.

          "There`s one place in Sochi i would prefer to avoid going to and that`s Riviera park, crowded any season, cramped with cheap fun at exaggetated prices, annoying vendors, crap food, no fun for parents and very little joy for the kids, well they have sort of a dinosaur exposition,",

          "We had a very mixed feeling about this park. The grounds are nicely kept, and there is a good selection of the rides and other experiences. But the biggest problem is a very aggressive advertisement, and leaflets handed out by the promoters. It\u2019s unbearable, every single step",

          "What I saw of Riviera park was basically a grand carnival/amusement park, not unlike what you would se at a state fair, but very well done. Clean and not too obnoxious, actually very pleasant by midway standards. I was there to go to the dolphinarium show, so the rest was sort",

          "Well, you probably better don't compare with amusement parks in Europe and the US but it's pretty decent. We were offered to buy a family ticket which costs like 1500 rub and it was 21 rides, which I consider pretty reasonable, it was enough for 3 of us. It included not all the",

Located in Sochi Olympic Park and named after Mount Fisht, the 40,000-capacity stadium was constructed for the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, where it served as the venue for their opening and closing ceremonies. \nThe stadium was originally built as an enclosed facility; it was re-opened in 2016 as an open-air football stadium, to host matches as part of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup when it was known simply as Fisht Stadium.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nFisht Olympic Stadium was designed by Populous and British design consultancy BuroHappold Engineering.  The stadium's roof was built from approximately 36,500 square metres (393,000 sq ft) of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) and was designed to give the roof the appearance of snowy peaks. The bowl opens to the north, allowing a direct view of the Krasnaya Polyana Mountains, and the upper deck is open to the south, allowing a view of the Black Sea.The canopy over the Western and Eastern stands is covered with translucent ethylene tetrafluoroethylene. The material offers superior strength and corrosion resistance.\nFisht is a UEFA category 4 stadium.\nThe field size of the Fisht Stadium is 105x68 m. The stadium has four stands: two on the sides under a translucent polycarbonate canopy and two open front stands.\n\n2006. Initial estimates placed the cost of construction to Russia at 1.7 billion rubles.\nThe architectural design was developed by Populous, a company with previous experience in designing similar facilities for Johannesburg.\n2008. Site clearing and purchasing of land began.\nStarting in 2008, the Government began to clear the territory for the future Olympic facility, buying land from the local population.\n2010. Construction of the Fisht Stadium began. A symbolic capsule was planted bearing the message \u201cBelieve in yourself, and together we will win\u201d and marking the start of construction.\n2011. The initial design was altered. According to some sources, changes were made at the request of Director of the Olympics Opening Ceremony Konstantin Ernst.\n2013. Construction of the stadium was completed. The stadium was the last Olympics facility to be commissioned.Having opened in 2013, it cost US$779 million to build the stadium. The stadium complex now serves as a training centre and match venue for the Russia national football team, and served as a site for matches during the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The stadium's capacity will be temporarily expanded to 41,220 through temporary seating at the open ends of the stadium. The capacity will be reduced to 40,000 after the World Cup in 2018.\n\n\n== Location and access ==\nFisht Stadium is located in Sochi, in the Sochi Olympic Park in Adler, south of the Sochi Airport, at 15 Olympic Avenue.\nThe Fisht Stadium can be reached by buses 57, 117, 125, 134, 173. A suburban electric train Sochi\u2013Adler\u2013Olympic Park also provides access to the stadium.\n\n\n== Safety and security ==\nBy 15 March 2017, the stadium obtained a building safety certificate, detailing its evacuation routes, fire-fighting systems and emergency response procedures. The certificate was a legal confirmation that Fisht was ready to host matches of the FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup. During the 2018 FIFA World Cup matches, the stadium will be serviced by 2,000 surveillance cameras and 600 EMERCOM employees will be ensuring the security at Fisht.\n\n\n== Post-Olympics usage ==\n\nIn January 2015, a 3 billion ruble (US$46 million) project began to renovate the stadium in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup; among other changes, the closed roof was removed in order to make the stadium compliant with FIFA regulations. The work was expected to be completed by June 2016, but the completion date was pushed back to November 2016. The ground became the second to host the Winter Olympics and World Cup, after the Stadio Olimpico in Turin, Italy.\nAfter the World Cup, FC Dynamo Saint Petersburg of the second division moved from St. Petersburg to Sochi to play in the Fisht Stadium. The team became PFC Sochi, the first professional club in the city since the disbanding of FC Zhemchuzhina-Sochi in 2013.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nIn October 2013, the Central Bank of Russia issued a commemorative 100-ruble note to mark 100 days before the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics. The blue-tinted banknote depicts a flying snowboarder on one side, and on the other the Fisht Olympic Stadium and a firebird.\n\n\n== Tournament results ==\n\n\n=== 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup ===\n\n\n=== 2018 FIFA World Cup ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Fisht Olympic Stadium at Wikimedia Commons\n\nFisht Olympic stadium construction\nhttp://welcome2018.com/sch\nhttp://vb.me/sch_stadium\nhttp://sch_stadium_eng",

        "wiki": "Armavia Flight 967 (U8 967/RNV 967) was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Armavia from Zvartnots International Airport, Zvarnots in Armenia to Sochi, a Black Sea coastal resort city in Russia. On 3 May 2006, the aircraft operating the route, an Airbus A320-200, crashed into the sea while attempting to go-around following its first approach to Sochi airport, killing all 113 aboard.The accident was the first major commercial airline crash in the year of 2006. It was Armavia's first and only fatal crash.\n\n\n== Flight ==\nThe aircraft took off from Zvartnots International Airport (EVN) at a scheduled departure time at 01:45 Armenian Daylight Time (20:45 UTC, May 2) and with a scheduled arrival time at Sochi International Airport (AER) of 02:00 Moscow Daylight Time (22:00 UTC, May 2).In order to make their decision for departure, the crew obtained the observed weather data and the weather forecast for the takeoff, landing and alternate aerodromes all of which met the requirements for IFR flights. All the crew were correctly licensed and adequately rested to operate the flight.\nThe airplane took off from Zvartnots airport at 20:47. There were 113 occupants on board: 105 passengers (including 5 children and 1 infant), 2 pilots,1 aircraft engineer and 5 flight attendants. Takeoff, climb and cruise were uneventful.\nThe first communication between Sochi approach controller and the crew took place at 21:10. At that moment the airplane was beyond the coverage area of the Sochi radar. Up until 21:17 the approach controller and the crew discussed the observed and forecast weather, and as a result the crew decided to return to Yerevan. At 21:26, after the decision had already been made, the crew asked the controller about the latest observed weather. At 21:30 the controller informed the crew that visibility was 3,600 metres (2.2 mi) and the cloud ceiling 170 m (560 ft). At 21:31 the crew decided to continue the flight to Sochi airport.\nThe next communication with the approach controller was at 22:00. At that moment the aircraft was descending to an altitude of 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and was being tracked by the Sochi radar. The approach controller cleared the flight for a descent to 1,800 m (5,900 ft) and reported the observed weather at Sochi, as at 22:00, for runway 06, which was above the minimums.\nThe crew was then handed over to the holding and tower controllers, and was cleared for descent to 600 m (2,000 ft), before entering the turn to the final approach. Whilst performing the turn, the runway extended centreline was overshot. After eliminating the deviation, the crew started descending the aircraft along the glide slope, following the approach pattern.\nAt 22:10 the crew reported that the gear was down and that they were ready for landing. In response they were advised that they were 10 kilometres (6.2 mi; 5.4 nmi) from the airport and that the weather was now 4,000 m (13,000 ft) visibility x 190 m (620 ft) cloud ceiling, and were cleared for landing. However, about 30 seconds later, the controller advised the crew of the observed cloud ceiling at 100 m (330 ft) and instructed them to cease their descent, abandon the landing attempt, and carry out a right turn and climb to 600 m (2,000 ft) and also to contact the holding controller, who gives instructions for entering the airport's holding pattern.\nThe last communication with the crew was at 22:12. After that the crew did not respond to any of the controller's calls. At 22:13 the aircraft struck the water, and broke up on impact.\n\n\n== Aircraft ==\n\nThe aircraft involved was built in France with its first flight in June 1995. It had a MSN number of 547 with a test registration code of F-WWIU. The aircraft was delivered in 1995 to Ansett Australia, registered in Australia as VH-HYO. It was acquired by Armavia in 2004 registered as EK-32009 with its name as Mesrop Mashtots. Armavia repainted the aircraft with its new livery on 31 October 2004. The aircraft had flown more than 10,000 hours before the crash.\n\n\n== Passengers and crew ==\n\nMost of the passengers were citizens of Armenia. According to reports, the flight had 85 Armenian citizens, 26 Russian citizens, one Georgian citizen, and one Ukrainian citizen.\nCitizenship of the passengers and crewThe Captain of Flight 967 was Grigor Grigoryan. Born in 1966, he had completed his primary training in Krasnokutsk Civil Flight School. He graduated in 1986 and also graduated from Moscow Institute of Civil Aviation Engineers. He joined Balaklavsky United as a co-pilot in 1986. He then joined Ararat Airlines in 1997 as a Captain of a Yakovlev Yak-40. He then joined Armavia as a co-pilot of an Airbus A320 in 2004 and subsequently promoted to a Captain in 2005. He had passed a test for an Airbus A320 Captain in SAS Flight Academy in Stockholm, Sweden with satisfying results. Captain Grigoryan had a total flight hours of 5,458 hours, including 1,436 hours on the Airbus A320.The First Officer (Co-pilot) of Flight 967 was Arman Davtyan. He was born in 1977 and had completed his primary training in Ulyanovsk Civil Flying School and graduated in 1999. He then joined Chernomor-Avia in December 2001 as a co-pilot of a Tupolev Tu-154. He joined Armavia in 2002, joined Armenian Airlines in 2004, and then joined Armavia again in the same year. First Officer Davtyan had passed a training course for an Airbus A320 in SAS Flight Academy in Stockholm, Sweden with satisfying results. He had a total flying hours of 2,185 hours, including 1,022 hours on the Airbus A320.\n\n\n== Recovery efforts ==\nFlight 967 disappeared from Sochi's radar at 02:13 local time. Chief of Flight Operation N.G Savelyev alerted all the search and rescue services in the area and deployed an Mi-8 helicopter. At 02:19, the disappearance of Flight 967 was informed to Russia's Minister of Emergencies. A search helicopter was ready for take off to find the missing flight, but was not allowed by Sochi due to the deteriorating weather. The search and rescue operation was then suspended. At 04:08, the Ministry of Emergency's boat Valery Zamarayez found the probable crash area. Rescuers then went to the search area. From 07:30 to 12:30, the search and rescue team recovered 9 body parts from the crash site.Search and rescue personnel only managed to recover some of the flight's debris. They recovered the Airbus' nose, landing gear, fin, elevator, and several other fragments. Wiring and electronic units were also found. A total of 52 body fragments were found by the search and rescue team as well. The BEA noted that, at the time when Flight 967 impacted the sea, the landing gear was extended. The lower part of the rudder was severely damaged due to the impact forces. Several parts of the aircraft elevator were also damaged. Some of the aircraft parts recovered from the sea were severely deformed.\n\n\n== Causes ==\n\n\n=== Weather ===\nThe weather at the time was considered to be fine. Low pressure was present near Sochi at the time. A cold front was also detected and was forming in the Caucasian Edge and further to the east of Turkey at the time. Rain was also present in Adler (Sochi). In the spring transition period, low clouds often occurred in the Caucasian Edge, which, could have limited visibility for the pilots. This proved to be dangerous, as most Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) occurs due to this kind of cloud (which obscures the pilots visual reference).Prior to take off from Yerevan, the crew was briefed on the weather conditions in Sochi. At the time, the weather in Sochi was fine. After the take off of Flight 967, the pilots were given another weather briefing. It was still in good condition, with considerable clouds, mist, and light rain. The weather at the time would not have allowed for a vortex (i.e. storm, tornado, downdraft). In the following hours, the probability that a vortex might occur was reduced to zero. By the time Flight 967 entered Sochi, the weather conditions had deteriorated. A cold front wave occurred in Sochi, producing Cumulonimbus cloud. The rain intensified, and the visibility was reduced to 1,500 m. For several minutes, the weather became better for landing. The controllers instructed Flight 967 to abort their descent and conduct a go-around immediately, as low clouds were present in Sochi Airport. Shortly afterwards, Flight 967 disappeared from Sochi Radar.\n\n\n=== Recorders analysis ===\nShortly after Flight 967 impacted water, the radio beacon signals, known as the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), started to sound. French BEA retrieved the submerged Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR) from the Black Sea and found that there were only minor damages in both recorders. BEA later examined both the CVR and the FDR.\n\n\n==== Examination ====\nBased on the examination, the flight was uneventful until the approach. However, during the cruise stage of the flight, First Officer Davtyan stated: \"**** it.. who operates such flights with the jitter and not enough sleep\". This may indicate that he didn't have adequate sleeping hours, meaning he was fatigued at the time. The BEA also noted that neither pilot understood how the autopilot of an Airbus A320 works. Analysis of the internal communications at this stage of the flight shows that Captain Grigoryan was annoyed by the fact that in DESCENT mode (MANAGED MODE) the descent rate was not as high as he expected. BEA noted that in this mode, the descent rate is calculated automatically, depending on a number of parameters describing the descent, e.g. the aircraft attitude in relation to the preset profile and so on. This fact shows that either the Captain did not fully understand the autopilot work algorithm in the DESCENT mode, or was in a state of high psycho-emotional strain with an imperative to land at Sochi as soon as possible.\nFlight 967 was then instructed by Sochi Tower to pass waypoint GUKIN and TABAN. It then passed both waypoints. While banking to turn to final approach, the rain started. First Officer Davtyan then overreacted by saying exclamation words, possibly due to emotional stress. The Sochi controller then told the crew of Flight 967 that the weather in Sochi had deteriorated, and instructed the pilot to abort their descent. The crew overreacted to this report, responding with negative words and expletives to the controller. The crew had been discussing the issue for three minutes, swearing about the controller's actions even between the items on the check list. Such behaviour by the crew must have inevitably resulted in an increase of their psycho-emotional stress.\nThe aircraft climbed, started to bank and the flaps were extended to 18\u00b0. At this point, Captain Grigoryan was heard in the CVR saying: \"**** him\" to the Sochi controller. The crew then contacted Sochi's holding controller, as well as the final controller. They then selected the \"glide-slope capture\" descent mode, which is an automatic descent. The aircraft was descending with two engaged autopilots and engaged auto-thrust. The speed was controlled by the auto-thrust at the target speed of 137 kn (254 km/h), stabilised on the glide-slope, in the landing configuration and ready for landing. The crew then proceed to the landing check list.\nSochi Tower instructed them to abort their descent and conduct a go-around, as low clouds had formed near the airport. The aircraft climbed, the thrust levers were moved to climb position, the flaps and slats remained fully extended, and the landing gear remained fully extended. A few minutes later, the \"Speed Speed Speed\" (LOW ENERGY) warning sounded. This warning advises the crew that \"the aircraft energy is decreasing to the limit, below which the engine thrust must be increased to regain a positive angle of the flight path\". At the moment when the aural warning sounded, the aircraft altitude was 1,150 ft (350 m), the crew then pushed the TO/GA button.\nBEA stated that none of the crew's actions were important and necessary for a go-around procedure, such as extending the flaps and the landing gear. This demonstrated that, at that time, both flight crews' condition were not at the optimum level. BEA also suspected that the LOW ENERGY warning wasn't detected or noticed by the crew.\nThe autopilot was then disengaged by the crew, as they cast doubts on the autopilot (on the cruise stage of the flight, First Officer Davtyan joked about the autopilot, stating that Captain Grigoryan's autopilot was better than him, indicating that they had doubts about the autopilot and suspected that it wasn't functioning properly.) Captain Grigoryan then banked the aircraft to the right.\nBoth crew members then became more physically and emotionally stressed, as further conversations among them revealed that their intonations became higher and higher. The aircraft then decreased its pitch up attitude and banked to the right. Then, one of the crew stepped on the rudder pedals, causing the rudder to deflect. This was not necessary. The BEA suspect that Captain Grigoryan stepped the pedals, while under psycho-emotional stress. Due to the emotional stress he was suffering at the time, he didn't notice that he had stepped the pedals.\nBEA then found that the crew may have been suffering a somatogravic illusion in flight. Somatogravic illusion, in aviation, is a type of optical illusion which can cause the crew to think that they are pitching up, while in reality, they are not. This could happen during night-time flying (causing the crew to lose their visual reference, as it was dark) accompanied by the lack of monitoring of the flight's indicator. Somatogravic illusion was responsible for the crash of Gulf Air Flight 072 in Bahrain. However, the BEA also suspected the specific features of the speed indication on the PFD, especially speed limitations for the Airbus A320 configuration that are shown as the red bars at the top of the speed indication strip. One of the crew members might have adopted the reflex acquired in training, for example, in response to a TCAS warning when the pilot is anxious to avoid the displayed red part of the instrument scale, which may result in the instinctive forward movement of the side stick, especially when the pilot is in a state of psycho-emotional strain. This version is substantiated by the fact that the pilot was monitoring the flight speed and its limitations (VFE) that depended on the Airbus A320 configuration and retracted the flaps and slats in a timely manner, and the control inputs on the side stick coincided with the moments when the current speed was getting close to the limit value. However, neither of these probable causes have enough evidence.\nThe crew of Flight 967 then communicated with Sochi Tower. Their words were not completed; \"Sochi Radar, Armavia 967...\". This was the last communication from Flight 967, as Captain Grigoryan ordered First Officer Davtyan to fully extend the flaps.After First Officer Davtyan extended the flaps to full, few seconds later, the master warning sounded, and continued to do so until the end of the recording. The speed at the time was too fast, which could tear the flaps apart and could cause the plane to crash, similar to Austral Lineas Aereas Flight 2553. The plane was banking to the right. Flight 967 began a nose-down attitude and the flaps then retracted to 18\u00b0. Captain Grigoryan then made an 11\u00b0 nose-down input, causing the plane to descend even further.\nCaptain Grigoryan aggravated the condition further by making a right bank input, causing the plane to bank severely to the right, with a roll angle of 39\u00b0. The Ground Proximity Warning System then sounded. First Officer Davtyan then ordered Captain Grigoryan to level off. At this moment, First Officer Davtyan intervened and moved the stick to the left position (20\u00b0 to the left) to counter the increasing right bank, while Captain Grigoryan continued making his control inputs to increase the right bank. Apparently, First Officer Davtyan was trying to counter the bank only, as he also made a nose-down input, causing the plane to descend even further.\nWhile intervening, First Officer Davtyan had not pressed the take-over push button, therefore, both pilot's control inputs were added and prohibited. This is known as dual input. Such dual piloting is prohibited. The dual input warning should have sounded at the time, however, because its priority is lower than the Ground Proximity Warning, it did not, and so neither pilot knew that they were making dual inputs on the aircraft.\nThe crew's attention might have been distracted by the controller's direction. The controller was sending the crew a 20-second long message, which was too long. While the plane was descending, one of the crew members suddenly moved the thrust lever way back, into its idle position, and then moved the thrust lever forward, causing the autothrottle to disengage. The crew then desperately tried to lift the plane up, but the plane impacted water at a speed of 285 knots (528 km/h; 328 mph), killing all on board instantly.\n\n\n=== Primary conclusions of the final accident report ===\nThe crash of Armavia Flight 967 was a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT), specifically water, while conducting a climbing maneuver after an aborted approach to Sochi airport at night with weather conditions below landing minimums for runway 06.\nWhile performing the climb with the autopilot disengaged, the captain, being in a psychoemotional stress condition, made nose down control inputs due to the loss of pitch and roll awareness. This started the abnormal situation. The captain's insufficient pitch control inputs led to a failure to recover the aircraft and caused it to crash.\nAlong with the inadequate control inputs from the captain, the contributing factors of the crash were also the lack of monitoring the aircraft's pitch attitude, altitude and vertical speed by the first officer and no proper reaction by the crew to GPWS warnings.\n\n\n=== Contributory factors and shortcomings ===\nSource:\n\n\n== Safety recommendations ==\nTo eliminate the shortcomings revealed during investigation of this accident, the final accident report made 22 safety recommendations as follows:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft\nEthiopian Airlines Flight 409\nFlydubai Flight 981\nAir China Flight 129\nAfriqiyah Airways Flight 771\nGulf Air Flight 072\n2016 Russian Defence Ministry Tupolev Tu-154 crash, a plane that crashed in 2016 near Flight 967 site.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAccident description at the Aviation Safety Network\nFinal accident report - (Statistics about the crash) \u2013 Interstate Aviation Committee \u2013 English translation done by and hosted by the Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) (Archive, Alternate, Archive) \u2013 Includes comments by the BEA on the investigation, and the IAC's response to the BEA's comments\nInvestigation and Report (Archive) - (Statistics about the crash) \u2013 Interstate Aviation Committee (in Russian) \u2013 The Russian version is the version of record\nTechnical Report (in Russian) (Archive)\nBureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'Aviation Civile\n\"Accident near Sochi on 2 May 2006.\" (Archive)\nArmeniapedia.org article on the crash\nAirDisaster.com \u2013 Armenian A320 crashes into Black Sea (Archive)\nARMAVIA FLIGHT RNV 967 ACCIDENT IN SOCHI, RUSSIA (Archive) \u2013 Airbus",

        "wiki": "Rob Hornstra (born 14 March 1975, in Borne, Overijssel) is a Dutch photographer and self-publisher of documentary work, particularly of areas of the former Soviet Union.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHornstra studied Social and Legal Services at Utrecht University of Applied Sciences from 1994 to 1998; for a year from summer 1996, he interned and then worked as a probation officer. From September 1998, he worked for over eight years as a host and bartender at Muziekcentrum Vredenburg in Utrecht. From 1999 to 2004, he studied photographic design at Utrecht School of the Arts.For his graduation project he spent one month in Russia photographing the lives of the first generation of young people growing up after the fall of communism. In the same year that he graduated he published this series as his first book, Communism and Cowgirls.\nSince graduation Hornstra has combined editorial work for newspapers and magazines with more personal, longer-term documentary work in the Netherlands, Iceland, and the former Soviet Union. Hornstra considers himself a maker of photographic documentaries rather than a photographer; when not photographing for a particular purpose, he does not carry a camera. Further, he sees books as more important than exhibitions, and regards his own editing, publication and marketing of books of his photography as an important part of his work.Hornstra prefers to work with film, in medium format or large format:\n\n[It] takes me quite a bit of time to set up my Mamiya medium-format camera and Horseman large-format camera. And that allows me to shoot more spontaneous pictures. Yes, it sounds contradictory. But snapshots aren't always so spontaneous by any means. When people have to pose for a long time, they eventually relax. Then you can really take nice pictures of them.\nIn 2006, together with the art historian Femke Lutgerink, Hornstra started work on Fotodok, an Utrecht-based organization that arranges exhibitions and other events for documentary photography. Itself inspired by Fotohof in Salzburg, Fotodok hopes eventually to create an exhibition space for documentary photography in Utrecht. Fotodok was launched in 2008; Hornstra stepped down as creative director in September 2009.\n\nStarting with his first collection, Communism and Cowgirls, Hornstra has published his own books. These skip forewords by other writers, biographical notes, ISBNs and the other trappings of conventionally published books; by taking advance orders and selling copies directly and also working through a small number of retailers, Hornstra is able to avoid normal distribution channels.Together with the writer and filmmaker Arnold van Bruggen, in 2009 Hornstra started the Sochi Project, which over five years would document the area of Sochi (Krasnodar Krai, Russia) and the changes to it during the preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Hornstra and Van Bruggen express surprise that the site chosen for such a large winter event would be one so close to politically volatile areas such as Abkhazia and one that by Russian standards has exceptionally mild winters. Under the slogan slow journalism, the pair request donations from the public for the crowdfunding of a project whose timescale is impossible for the mass media. The stories Hornstra and Van Bruggen collected as part of the project have appeared in newspapers, photobooks and online over the course of the five-year period. The project culminated in the retrospective book An Atlas of War and Tourism in the Caucasus published by Aperture in 2013, and in 2014 an exhibition that toured Europe, America and Canada.\nHornstra and Van Bruggen have also created more democratic exhibitions, made entirely of newsprint, that can be shown on the walls of small galleries with no budget for framed prints or video installations: On the Other Side of the Mountains (2010), two copies of which create an exhibition; Paris Photo Newsprint Exhibition (2012), with thirty photographs; and three versions of Billboard Sochi Singers, each containing the sheets to assemble either of two posters.Critic Sean O'Hagan, writing in The Guardian, said \"Whichever way you look at it, The Sochi Project is an incredible piece of journalism, both visual and written, and a glimpse of the medium's future.\"In 2019, Hornstra and Van Bruggen announced the start of another long-term project: The Europeans, inspired by Henri Cartier-Bresson's 1955 book The Europeans and prompted by the recent rise of voters and regimes dissatisfied with the European ideal.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n\n=== Solo exhibitions, and pair exhibitions with Arnold van Bruggen ===\n\nCommunism and Cowgirls, Fotohof, Salzburg, 2005.\nCommunism and Cowgirls, De Balie, Amsterdam, 2006.\nRoots of the R\u00fantur, National Museum of Iceland, Reykjav\u00edk, 2006.\n101 Billionaires and Other Stories, Flatland Gallery, Utrecht, 2009.\nThe Sochi Project, Mandeep Photography, Rome; Spazio Labo' \u2013 Centro di Fotografia, Bologna, 2010.\nViews from Sochi.

The inaugural World Championship Russian Grand Prix took place in 2014, beginning a seven-year contract.\nAlso, the TCR International Series raced at Sochi in June 2015, with the TCR Russian Series and SMP F4 Championship as support series.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nEarlier the International Olympic Committee was given the power to delay the race until 2015 if preparations for the race interfered with the Winter Olympics, though the Games started without interruption. In October 2011, the Russian government set aside US$195.4 million for the construction of the circuit.The construction of the Sochi Olympic Park Circuit marked the end of a thirty-year campaign for a Russian Grand Prix, with plans for a \"Grand Prix of the Soviet Union\" originating as early as 1983 before being abandoned for \"bureaucratic reasons\" and several failed attempts in the intervening years.\nThe circuit received its final approval from the FIA in August 2014.\n\n\n== The circuit ==\n\nThe 5.848-kilometre (3.634 mi) circuit is the fourth-longest circuit on the Formula One calendar, behind Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium, Baku City Circuit in Azerbaijan and Silverstone in the UK. The circuit is built around the Sochi Olympic Park, that is the coastal cluster of Olympic venues built for the 2014 Winter Olympics that have hosted competitions in ice hockey, speed skating, curling, figure skating, short track etc., and Fisht Olympic Stadium where Opening and Closing ceremonies were held. The surface was not laid until after the Closing Ceremony of the Olympics.\n\nThe circuit, designed by German architect Hermann Tilke, has the start grid on the northern edge of the Olympic Park next to the railway station, heading southwest towards the Black Sea coast. Then it runs along the outer edge of the central Sochi Medals Plaza, that is the podium for Olympic medal ceremonies. The long Turn 3 is one of the most notable on the circuit, and has been compared to the famous Turn 8 in Istanbul Park. Then, the track circles the plaza counterclockwise and makes three turns around the Bolshoy Ice Dome. Then follow series of tight corners before turning north where the track skirts the edge of the Olympic Park, above the main Olympic Village and the Adler Arena Skating Center. Then it passes the skating and curling centres, before funneling up behind the pit paddock toward the train station, and completing a circuit with two ninety-degree right turns.\n\n\n== Lap records ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n2014 Winter Olympics\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSochi Autodrom photos\nOMEGA Center (official development site)\nSochi Autodrom Guide\nSochi Autodrom on Google Maps (Current Formula 1 Tracks)",

          "The only two negative comments are : all is written just in Russian so it is hard on navigation. Also the people at site hardly if at all speak English other then this great ski lanes for all Levels and decent price. About 5000 tubal for daily ski pass and full equipment rental.",
          "The Radisson is an excellent hotel. The service staff are all good. The restaurant is very good. The conference facilities are excellent. The hotel is located right inside the village so there is easy access to the chair lifts, the river, the public walkways and the stores.",
          "I have visited this place with my friends. Many activities to do. If you will stay at Risa Khutor, you have to go to Rosa Peak 2320 meters above the sea using few gandoles. At every level have some activities that must try: bridge, observation desk, free small photo, good",

          "If you planning to travel to Sochi, you most visit Rosa Khutor. It\u2019s really amazing place for kids and adults. I visited on June, the weather was very nice, the little ice on the top of mountain making the view more beautiful but it wasn\u2019t cold. There is many activities for kids",
          "Of many places I have visit, I consider Sochi to be by favorite destination for its reasonably priced and there are plenty to do. The weather is fantastic and place is very safe. You can sky and swim in the same day. For sport lovers, you will be surprised of how many activities",

          "We were on a 3 nights visit to Rosa Khutor. Reached Sochi airport and took a taxi. Reached in 50 minutes. A bit uphill. The town is dissected by a gurgling river with hotels on both sides. There are rope ways/gondolas/cable cars (all same) that take you to 2450 meters on a snow",

          "I enjoyed Rosa Khutor itself for walking around, the scenery and the choice of restaurants and hotels. However, going into the mountains the waiting time on the lifts was too long up on the slopes. I went back to Gorky Gorod where skiing was more fun, due to less crowds and",

          "I think that this resort was built from nothing, everything seems brand new. And even out of the season, quite busy and crowded. Please note that, if you want to climb up to 2370 m, the cable car runs till late at night, so you will have no problem to do it. Would I go to ski",

          "The ski facilities of the Rosa Khutor resort can be compared with European alpine resorts. It's not the Three Valleys or Italian Dolomite Ski, but it's much more interesting than Bad/Badhof Gastein or Stubai in Austria. The Resort has a plenty of pistes of all the complexity",

It is located in Western Russia, on the Black Sea coast near Russia's southern border. The Greater Sochi area, which includes territories and localities subordinated to Sochi proper, has a total area of 3,526 square kilometers (1,361 sq mi) and sprawls for 145 kilometers (90 mi) along the shores of the Black Sea near the Caucasus Mountains. The area of the city proper is 176.77 square kilometers (68.25 sq mi). According to the 2010 Census, the city had a permanent population of 343,334, up from 328,809 recorded in the 2002 Census, making it Russia's largest resort city. Being part of the Caucasian Riviera, it is one of the very few places in Russia with a subtropical climate, with warm to hot summers and mild winters.\nWith the alpine and Nordic events held at the nearby ski resort of Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi hosted the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, as well as the Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix from 2014 until at least 2020. It was also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore the whole area was conquered by Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian invaders, the Zygii people lived in Lesser Abkhazia under the Kingdom of Pontus, then the Roman Empire's influence in antiquity. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of Lazica and Abkhazia, who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was unified under the single Georgian monarchy in 11th-century, forming one of the Saeristavo, known as Tskhumi extending its possessions up to Nicopsis. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading Alans, Khazars, Mongols and other nomadic empires whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century Byzantine basilica still stands in the Loo Microdistrict.From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi known as Ubykhia was part of historical Circassia, and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, which was their principal trading partner in the Muslim world.\n\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nThe coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Caucasian War and the Russo-Turkish War, 1828\u20131829; however, the Circassians did not admit the Russian control over Circassia and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the Circassian coast (Adyghe: \u0410\u0434\u044b\u0433\u044d \u0445\u044b \u0430\u0443\u0448\u0443). Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the Russian Empire and the British Empire that occurred in 1836 over the mission of the Vixen.The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron Feodor Tornau investigated the coastal route from Gelendzhik to Gagra, and across the mountains to Kabarda, in the 1830s. In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the Sochi River as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky in order to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on Cape Adler soon after.\nThe last battle of the Caucasian War took place at the Godlikh river on March 18, 1864 O.S., where the Ubykhs were defeated by the Dakhovsky regiment of the Russian Army. On March 25, 1864, the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of Caucasian War was proclaimed at Kbaade tract (modern Krasnaya Polyana) on June 2 (21 May O.S.), 1864, by the manifesto of Emperor Alexander II read aloud by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia.After the end of Caucasian War (during the period of 1864\u20131870) almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the Shapsugs, who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed in the Circassian Genocide or expelled to the Ottoman Empire (see Circassian Genocide). Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia.In 1874\u20131891, the first Russian Orthodox church, St. Michael's Church, was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed Dakhovsky Posad on April 13, 1874 (O.S.). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky Posad was renamed Sochi Posad (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed Black Sea Governorate. In 1900\u20131910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, \"Kavkazskaya Riviera\", opened on June 14, 1909 (O.S.). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Soviet time ===\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the littoral area saw sporadic armed clashes involving the Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev's Constructivist Institute of Rheumatology (1927\u20131931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Modern Russia ===\nFollowing Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimean Peninsula (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a Greater Sochi which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGreater Sochi is elongated along the Black Sea coast for 145 kilometers (90 mi). Sochi is approximately 1,603 kilometers (996 mi) from Moscow.The city of Sochi borders with Tuapsinsky District in the northwest, with Apsheronsky District and with Maykopsky District of the Republic of Adygea in the north, with Mostovsky District in the northeast, and with Georgia/Abkhazia in the southeast. From the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea.\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are Lazarevskoye, Loo, Dagomys, central Sochi (Tsentralny City District), Khosta, Matsesta, and Adler. The whole city is located on the slopes of the Western Caucasus which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the Mzymta, which is in fact the longest Black Sea tributary in Russia, and the Shakhe. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the Sochi, the Khosta, and the Matsesta. The Psou River makes the border with Abkhazia.\nThe northeastern part of the city belongs to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve which is a World Heritage Site spanning vast areas in Krasnodar Krai and Adygea. Almost the whole area of the Greater Sochi, with the exception of the coast and of the area which belong to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, are included into Sochi National Park.\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters (average 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from December to March and warm summers (average 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) during the day and 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) at night) in the period from May to October.\n\n\n=== Layout and landmarks ===\nSochi is unique among larger Russian cities as having some aspects of a subtropical resort. Apart from the scenic Caucasus Mountains, pebble and sand beaches, the city attracts vacation-goers with its subtropical vegetation, numerous parks, monuments, and extravagant Stalinist architecture. About two million people visit Greater Sochi each summer, when the city is home to the annual film festival \"Kinotavr\" and a getaway for Russia's elite.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 2,957 square kilometers (731,000 acres) Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, lies just north from the city. Sochi also has the region's most northerly tea plantations.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSochi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), at the lower elevations. Its average annual temperature is 18.4 \u00b0C (65.1 \u00b0F) during the day and 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) at night. In the coldest months\u2014January and February\u2014the average temperature is about 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) during the day, above 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F). In the warmest months\u2014July and August\u2014the temperature typically ranges from 25 to 29 \u00b0C (77 to 84 \u00b0F) during the day, about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is about 23\u201324 \u00b0C (73\u201375 \u00b0F). Yearly sunshine hours are around 2,200. Generally, the summer season lasts four months, from June to September. Two months\u2014April and November\u2014are transitional; sometimes temperatures reach 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with an average temperature of around 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) during the day and 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at night. December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperature (of these four months) 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) during the day and 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) at night. Average annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters (67 in). Sochi lies at 8b/9a hardiness zone, so the city supports different types of palm trees. Sochi is situated on the same latitude as Nice but strong cold winds from Asia make winters less warm. In fact, temperatures drop below freezing every winter. The highest temperature recorded was 39.4 \u00b0C (102.9 \u00b0F), on July 30, 2000, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221213.4 \u00b0C (7.9 \u00b0F) on January 25, 1892.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status and city divisions ==\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Krasnaya Polyana) and seventy-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Sochi\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Sochi is incorporated as Sochi Urban Okrug.Sochi is administratively subdivided into four city districts: Tsentralny City District, Lazarevsky City District, Khostinsky City District, and Adlersky City District. Tsentralny City District, comprising the central portion of, is by far the smallest out of four in terms of the area, and the other three have comparable areas, with Lazarevsky City District being the biggest. In terms of the population, Tsentralny City District is approximately twice as big as each of the other three city districts.\n\n\n=== Tsentralny City District ===\n\nTsentralny City District, or central Sochi, covers an area of 32 square kilometers (12 sq mi) and, as of the 2010 Census, has a population of 137,677. The highlights include:\n\nMichael Archangel Cathedral, a diminutive church built in 1873\u20131891 to Kaminsky's designs in order to commemorate the victorious conclusion of the Caucasian War.\nThe red-granite Archangel Column, erected in 2006 in memory of the Russian soldiers fallen in Sochi during the Caucasian War. It is capped by a 7-metre bronze statue of Sochi's patron saint, Michael the Archangel.\nSochi Art Museum occupies a large building with a four-columned portico, completed in 1939. The Neoclassical design is by Ivan Zholtovsky.\nSochi Arboretum, a large botanical garden with tropical trees from many countries, and the Mayors Alle\u00e9\u2014a landscape avenue of palm trees planted by mayors from cities around the world.\nThe Tree of Friendship, a hybrid citrus tree planted in 1934 in the Subtropical Botanic Garden. Since 1940 numerous citrus cultivars from foreign countries have been grafted onto this tree as a token of friendship and peace. The associated Friendship Tree Garden Museum has a collection of 20,000 commemorative presents from around the world.\nThe Winter Theater (1934\u20131937) is another rigorously Neoclassical edifice, surrounded by 88 Corinthian columns, with a pediment bearing the statues of Terpsichore, Melpomene and Thalia, all three cast by Vera Mukhina.\nHall of Organ and Chamber Music. Located centrally in the city of Sochi it conducts organ, symphony, chamber-ensemble, choral, vocal music concerts. All year round the Sochi Symphony Orchestra, local actors of the city art groups, famous Russian and international performers, International Contests Winners and Laureates give concerts here.\nThe Maritime Passenger Terminal (1955) is notable for its distinctive 71-meter-high steepled tower and four statues symbolizing the cardinal points.\nThe Railway Station (1952) is one of the most remarkable buildings of Sochi.\nThe Riviera Park was established by Vasily Alexeyevich Khludov in 1883 in the part of the city which later became known as Khludovskaya. The park is popular with tourists and local residents alike. It has a variety of attractions, including an outcrop of funny statues and a \"glade of friendship\" where magnolia trees were planted by every Soviet cosmonaut, among other notables.\n\n\n=== Lazarevsky City District ===\n\nLazarevsky City District lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people. It is the largest city district by area, covering some 1,744 square kilometers (673 sq mi) and comprising several microdistricts:\n\nLazarevskoye, 59 km (37 mi) from the city center, contains a delphinarium, an old church (1903), and a new church (1999). The settlement was founded as a Russian military outpost in 1839 and was named after Admiral Mikhail Lazarev.\nLoo, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, was once owned by Princes Loov, a noble Abkhazian family. The district contains the ruins of a medieval church, founded in the 8th century, rebuilt in the 11th century, and converted into a fortress in the Late Middle Ages.\nDagomys, 18 km (11 mi) from the city center, has been noted for its botanical garden, established by order of Nicholas II, as well as tea plantations and factories. A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins Bocharov Ruchey, a dacha built for Kliment Voroshilov in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the President of Russia, where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.\nGolovinka is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the Ubykhs and the Shapsugs, the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the Subashi landing of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted Decembrists used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the Crimean War, so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.\nFort Godlik, of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the Khazars and revived by the Genoese in the High Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Khostinsky City District ===\n\nKhostinsky City District, sprawling to the southeast from the city center, occupies approximately 374 square kilometers (144 sq mi), with a population of 65,229 as of the 2010 Census. The district is traversed by many rivulets which give their names to the microdistricts of Matsesta (\"flame-colored river\"), Kudepsta, and Khosta (\"the river of boars\").\n\n\n=== Adlersky City District ===\n\nAdlersky City District, with an area of 1,352 square kilometers (522 sq mi) and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census, is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient Sadz village and a medieval Genoese trading post.\nAmong the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation from about 30,000 years ago. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages (auls), the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nAlso located here are the largest trout fishery in Russia (founded in 1964) and a breeding nursery for great apes.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%).\nThe city is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi's Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey's northeastern Black Sea coast who came in the late 19th century and on. The rest are Armenians from Georgia (particularly from Abkhazia and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Armenia (especially from Shirak Province due to the 1988 earthquake).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Sochi region in the Middle Ages. The region was relatively isolated before 1829. In the North, a few hundred Sunni Muslim Shapsugs, a part of the Circassian nation, lived around Tkhagapsh, near Lazarevskoye. The Circassians (also known as Adyghe) converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread to the region.Currently, Sochi is a large predominantly Christian city, though there are thought to be around 20,000 Muslims (5% of inhabitants) living there now (the majority are Adyghe) plus other Eastern Caucasians, Turks, Tatars, and other smaller Muslim groups.A mosque was built in 2008 by United Arab Emirates in the central area of Bytkha, in addition to the old mosque being around 40 km (25 miles) north of the city center in the Adyghe aul of Tkhagapsh.\nThere are around thirty Russian Orthodox churches, the largest being St. Michael's, and two monasteries, plus two Catholic churches, one in the center of Sochi and the other in Lazarevskoye. The Armenian community, which is important in Sochi, gathers in about ten churches.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSochi is home to the following high educational institutions (masters level degree and PhD):  Sochi State University, Russian International Innovative University, and Russian International Olympic University.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Sports facilities ===\nSochi is also known for its sport facilities: a local tennis school spawned the careers of such notable players as Grand Slam champions Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Kafelnikov spent much of his childhood here, while Sharapova relocated to Florida at the age of seven). In late 2005, the Russian Football Union announced that it was planning to establish a year-round training center for the country's national teams in Sochi. The city's warm climate was cited as one of the main incentives. Sochi is also the home for the football team PFC Sochi which plays in the Russian Premier League and for the ice hockey team HC Sochi which plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\n\n=== 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===\n\nThe nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor at Krasnaya Polyana was the location of the alpine and Nordic events for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nIn June 2006, the International Olympic Committee announced that Sochi had been selected as a finalist city to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On July 4, 2007, Sochi was announced as the host city of the 2014 Winter Games, edging out Pyeongchang, South Korea and Salzburg, Austria.This was Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The site of a training centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi saw concern and controversy following a new federal law approved in Russia in June 2013 that bans \"homosexual propaganda to minors\". There were also concerns over Islamist militants.\n\n\n==== Construction work ====\n\nThe state-controlled RAO UES announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30 billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014. The power generating companies Inter RAO UES and RusHydro would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants\u2014and the federal grid company FGC UES has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW\u2014of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. \"The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6 billion rubles (about US $3.26 billion), of which 50 billion rubles (about US$2 billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid,\" the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8 billion rubles (about US$1.9 billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38 billion roubles (about US$1.48 billion) of that.\n\n\n=== Other sports events ===\n\nThe Silk Way Rally which is part of Dakar series took place in Sochi in 2010 for the last stage between the capital of the Republic of Adygea Maykop to the city of Sochi through Pseshwap.President Vladimir Putin reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone for the city to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix from 2014.The World Robot Olympiad took place in the Adler Arena Skating Center on November 21\u201323, 2014.\nThe 2014 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen was played in Sochi in November 2014, with Carlsen emerging as the winner.\nThe Fisht Olympic Stadium was also used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches.\nSince 2014, the city has hosted HC Sochi, who play at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in the Kontinental Hockey League, the biggest ice hockey league in Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nPublic transport is represented mainly by bus and taxi. Sochi is served by the Adler-Sochi International Airport. Types of non-mass public transport include two funiculars (at the Central military sanatorium and Ordzhonikidze resort) and three cable cars (at arboretum sanatorium \"Dawn\" and pension \"Neva\") also has several cableways in Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe Sochi Port terminal building was built in 1955 by Karo Alabyan and Leonid Karlik in Stalinist architecture. It is topped with a 71-meter steepled tower. Sculptures embodying seasons and cardinal points are set above the tower's three tiers.\nFive of the railway stations of Sochi were renovated for the 2014 Winter Olympics. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta and Khosta railway stations. In Adler city district of Sochi, the original railway station was preserved and new railway station was built near it.

        "wiki": "Trabzon (Turkish pronunciation: [\u02c8t\u027eabzon]), historically known as Trebizond in English, is a city on the Black Sea coast of northeastern Turkey and the capital of Trabzon Province. Trabzon, located on the historical Silk Road, became a melting pot of religions, languages and culture for centuries and a trade gateway to Persia in the southeast and the Caucasus to the northeast. The Venetian and Genoese merchants paid visits to Trebizond during the medieval period and sold silk, linen and woolen fabric.\nBoth republics had merchant colonies within the city \u2013 Leonkastron and the former 'Venetian castle' \u2013 that played a role to Trebizond similar to the one Galata played to Constantinople (modern Istanbul). Trabzon formed the basis of several states in its long history and was the capital city of the Empire of Trebizond between 1204 and 1461. During the early modern period, Trabzon, because of the importance of its port, again became a focal point of trade to Persia and the Caucasus.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe Turkish name of the city is Trabzon. It is historically known in English as Trebizond. The first recorded name of the city is the Greek T\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 (Trapezous), referencing the table-like central hill between the Za\u011fnos (\u0130skeleboz) and Kuzgun streams on which it was founded (\u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1 meant \"table\" in Ancient Greek; note the table on the coin in the figure.) In Latin, Trabzon was called Trapezus, which is a latinization of its ancient Greek name. Both in Pontic Greek and Modern Greek, it is called \u03a4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 (Trapezounta). In Ottoman Turkish and Persian, it is written as \u0637\u0631\u0628\u0632\u0648\u0646. During Ottoman times, Tara Bozan was also used. Some western geographers used this name instead of the Latin Trebizond. In Laz it is known as \u10e2\u10d0\u10db\u10e2\u10e0\u10d0 (T'amt'ra) or T'rap'uzani, in Georgian it is \u10e2\u10e0\u10d0\u10de\u10d8\u10d6\u10dd\u10dc\u10d8 (T'rap'izoni) and in Armenian it is \u054f\u0580\u0561\u057a\u056b\u0566\u0578\u0576 Trapizon. The 19th-century Armenian travelling priest Byjiskian called the city by other, native names, including Hur\u015fidabat and Ozinis. Other versions of the name, which have incidentally been used in English literature as well, include: Trebizonde (Fr.), Trapezunt (German), Trebisonda (Sp.), Trapesunta (It.), Trapisonda, Tribisonde, Terabesoun, Trabesun, Trabuzan, Trabizond and Tarabossan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Iron Age and Classical Antiquity ===\n\nBefore the city was founded as a Greek colony the area was dominated by Colchian (Caucasian) and Chaldian (Anatolian) tribes. It is possible that the settlement origins of Trabzon go back to these tribes. The Hayasa, who had been in conflict with the Central-Anatolian Hittites in the 14th century BCE, are believed to have lived in the area south of Trabzon. Later Greek authors mentioned the Macrones and the Chalybes as native peoples. One of the dominant Caucasian groups to the east were the Laz, who were part of the monarchy of the Colchis, together with other related Georgian peoples.According to Greek sources the city was founded in classical antiquity in 756 BCE as T\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 (Trapezous), by Milesian traders from Sinope. It was one of a number (about ten) of Milesian emporia or trading colonies along the shores of the Black Sea. Others included Abydos and Cyzicus in the Dardanelles, and nearby Kerasous. Like most Greek colonies, the city was a small enclave of Greek life, and not an empire unto its own, in the later European sense of the word. As a colony Trapezous initially paid tribute to Sinope, but early banking (money-changing) activity is suggested occurring in the city already in the 4th century BCE, according to a silver drachma coin from Trapezus in the British Museum, London. Cyrus the Great added the city to the Achaemenid Empire, and was possibly the first ruler to consolidate the eastern Black Sea region into a single political entity (a satrapy).\n\nTrebizond's trade partners included the Mossynoeci. When Xenophon and the Ten Thousand mercenaries were fighting their way out of Persia, the first Greek city they reached was Trebizond (Xenophon, Anabasis, 5.5.10). The city and the local Mossynoeci had become estranged from the Mossynoecian capital, to the point of civil war. Xenophon's force resolved this in the rebels' favor, and so in Trebizond's interest.\nUp until the conquests of Alexander the Great the city remained under the dominion of the Achaemenids. While the Pontus was not directly affected by the war, its cities gained independence as a result of it. Local ruling families continued to claim partial Persian heritage, and Persian culture had some lasting influence on the city; the holy springs of mt. Minthrion to the east of the old town were devoted to the Persian-Anatolian Greek god Mithra. In the 2nd century BCE the city with its natural harbours was added to the Kingdom of Pontus by Pharnaces I. Mithridates VI Eupator made it the home port of the Pontic fleet, in his quest to remove the Romans from Anatolia.\nAfter the defeat of Mithridates in 66 BCE the city was first handed to the Galatians, but it was soon returned to the grandson of Mithradates, and subsequently became part of the new client Kingdom of Pontus. When the kingdom was finally annexed to the Roman province of Galatia two centuries later, the fleet passed to new commanders, becoming the Classis Pontica. The city received the status of civitas libera, extending it judicial autonomy and the right to mint its own coin. Trabzon gained importance for its access to roads leading over the Zigana Pass to the Armenian frontier or the upper Euphrates valley. New roads were constructed from Persia and Mesopotamia under the rule of Vespasian. In the next century, the emperor Hadrian commissioned improvements to give the city a more structured harbor. The emperor visited the city in the year 129 as part of his inspection of the eastern border (limes). A mithraeum now serves as a crypt for the church and monastery of Panagia Theoskepastos (K\u0131zlar Manast\u0131r\u0131) in nearby Kizlara, east of the citadel and south of the modern harbor.\n\nTrebizond was greatly affected by two events over the following centuries: in the civil war between Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger, the city suffered for its support of the latter, and in 257 the city was pillaged by the Goths, despite reportedly being defended by \"10,000 above its usual garrison\", and being defended by two bands of walls.Although Trebizond was rebuilt after being pillaged by the Goths in 257 and the Persians in 258, the city did not soon recover. Only in the reign of Diocletian appears an inscription alluding to the restoration of the city; Ammianus Marcellinus could only write of Trebizond that it was \"not an obscure town.\" Christianity had reached Trebizond by the third century, for during the reign of Diocletian occurred the martyrdom of Eugenius and his associates Candidius, Valerian, and Aquila. Eugenius had destroyed the statue of Mithras which overlooked the city from Mount Minthrion (Boztepe), and became the patron saint of the city after his death. Early Christians sought refuge in the Pontic Mountains south of the city, where they established Vazelon Monastery in 270 AD and Sumela Monastery in 386 AD. As early as the First Council of Nicea, Trebizond had its own bishop. Subsequently, the Bishop of Trebizond was subordinated to the Metropolitan Bishop of Poti. Then during the 9th century, Trebizond itself became the seat of the Metropolitan Bishop of Lazica.\n\n\n=== Byzantine period ===\n\nBy the time of Justinian, the city served as an important base in his Persian Wars, and Miller notes that a portrait of the general Belisarius \"long adorned the church of St. Basil.\" An inscription above the eastern gate of the city, commemorated the reconstruction of the civic walls following an earthquake at Justinian's expense. At some point before the 7th century the university (Pandidakterion) of the city was reestablished with a quadrivium curriculum. The university drew students not just from the Byzantine Empire, but from Armenia as well.The city regained importance when it became the seat of the theme of Chaldia. Trebizond also benefited when the trade route regained importance in the 8th to 10th centuries; 10th-century Muslim authors note that Trebizond was frequented by Muslim merchants, as the main source transshipping Byzantine silks into eastern Muslim countries. According to the 10th century Arab geographer Abul Feda it was regarded as being largely a Lazian port. The Italian maritime republics such as the Republic of Venice and in particular the Republic of Genoa were active in the Black Sea trade for centuries, using Trabzon as an important seaport for trading goods between Europe and Asia. Some of the Silk Road caravans carrying goods from Asia stopped at the port of Trebizond, where the European merchants purchased these goods and carried them to the port cities of Europe with ships. This trade provided a source of revenue to the state in the form of custom duties, or kommerkiaroi, levied on the goods sold in Trebizond. The Greeks protected the coastal and inland trade routes with a vast network of garrison forts.Following the Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, Trebizond came under Seljuk rule. This rule proved transient when an expert soldier and local aristocrat, Theodore Gabras took control of the city from the Turkish invaders, and regarded Trebizond, in the words of Anna Comnena, \"as a prize which had fallen to his own lot\" and ruled it as his own kingdom. Supporting Comnena's assertion, Simon Bendall has identified a group of rare coins he believes were minted by Gabras and his successors. Although he was killed by the Turks in 1098, other members of his family continued his de facto independent rule into the next century.\n\n\n=== Empire of Trebizond ===\n\nThe Empire of Trebizond was formed after Georgian expedition in Chaldia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople. Located at the far northeastern corner of Anatolia, it was the longest surviving of the Byzantine successor states. Byzantine authors, such as Pachymeres, and to some extent Trapezundines such as Lazaropoulos and Bessarion, regarded the Trebizond Empire as being no more than a Lazian border state. Thus from the point of view of the Byzantine writers connected with the Lascaris and later with the Palaiologos, the rulers of Trebizond were not emperors.\n\nGeographically, the Empire of Trebizond consisted of little more than a narrow strip along the southern coast of the Black Sea, and not much further inland than the Pontic Mountains. However, the city gained great wealth from the taxes it levied on the goods traded between Persia and Europe via the Black Sea. The Mongol siege of Baghdad in 1258 diverted more trade caravans towards the city. Genoese and to a lesser extent Venetian traders regularly came to Trabzon. To secure their part of the Black Sea trade, the Genoese bought the coastal fortification \"Leonkastron\", just west of the winter harbour, in the year 1306.\nOne of the most famous persons to have visited the city in this period was Marco Polo, who ended his overland return journey at the port of Trebizond, and sailed to his hometown Venice with a ship; passing by Constantinople (Istanbul) on the way, which was retaken by the Byzantines in 1261. A year earlier, in 1260, Niccol\u00f2 and Maffeo Polo (the father and uncle of Marco Polo) were residing in Constantinople, then the capital of the Latin Empire. They foresaw a political change, liquidated their assets into jewels and moved away. Their decision proved wise, as Constantinople was recaptured in 1261 by Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, who promptly burned the Venetian quarter in the city and reestablished the Byzantine Empire. Captured Venetian citizens in Constantinople were blinded, while many of those who managed to escape perished aboard overloaded refugee ships fleeing to other Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea.\n\nTogether with Persian goods, Italian traders brought stories about the city to Western Europe. Trebizond played a mythical role in European literature of the late middle-ages and the Renaissance. Miguel de Cervantes and Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais gave their protagonists the desire to possess the city. Next to literature, the legendary history of the city \u2013 and that of the Pontus in general \u2013 also influenced the creation of paintings, theatre plays and operas in Western Europe throughout the following centuries.\nThe city also played a role in the early Renaissance; The western takeover of Constantinople, which formalized Trebizond's political independence, also led Byzantine intellectuals to seek refuge in the city. Especially Alexios II of Trebizond and his grandson Alexios III were patrons of the arts and sciences. After the great city fire of 1310, the ruined university was reestablished. As part of the university Gregory Choniades opened a new academy of astronomy, which housed the best observatory outside Persia. Choniades brought with him the works of Shams al-Din al-Bukhari, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi and Abd al-Rahman al-Khazini from Tabriz, which he translated into Greek. These works later found their way to western Europe, together with the astrolabe. The observatory Choniades built would become known for its accurate solar eclipse predictions, but was probably used mostly for astrological purposes for the emperor and/or the church.The Black Death arrived at the city late 1346, probably via Kaffa. At that time the local aristocracy was engaged in the Trapezuntine Civil War. Constantinople remained the Byzantine capital until it was conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1453, who also conquered Trebizond eight years later, in 1461.\nIts demographic legacy endured for several centuries after the Ottoman conquest in 1461, as a substantial number of Greek Orthodox inhabitants, usually referred to as Pontic Greeks, continued to live in the area during Ottoman rule, up until 1923, when they were deported to Greece. A few thousand Greek Muslims still live in the area, mostly in the \u00c7aykara-Of dialectical region to the southeast of Trabzon. Most are Sunni Muslim, while there are some recent converts in the city and possibly a few Crypto-Christians in the Tonya/G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane area to the southwest of the city. Compared to most previously Greek cities in Turkey, a large amount of its Greek Byzantine architectural heritage survives as well.\n\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\n\nThe last Emperor of Trebizond, David, surrendered the city to Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire in 1461. Following this takeover, Mehmed II sent many Turkish settlers into the area, but the old ethnic Greek, Laz and Armenian communities remained. According to the Ottoman tax books (tahrir defterleri), the total population of adult males in the city was 1,473 in the year 1523. Approximately 85% of them (1,252 adult males) were Christian, 13% of whom (197 adult males) were Armenian, and 15% of them (221 adult males) were Muslim. However, a large portion of the local Christians were Islamized and Turkified by the end of the 17th century, according to a research by Prof. Halil \u0130nalc\u0131k on the tax books (tahrir defterleri) of the Ottoman Empire. Trabzon was sanjak centre in Rum Eyalet (1461\u20131514) and (1520\u20131535), Erzincan-Bayburt eyalet (1514\u20131517), Anadolu Eyalet (1517\u20131520) and Erzurum Eyalet (1535\u20131598).It was the capital of the Ottoman Eyalet of Trebizond (1598\u20131867) and later of the Ottoman Vilayet of Trebizond (1867\u20131923) in the northeastern part of Anatolia. During the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, his son Prince Selim (later Sultan Selim I) was the sancakbeyi of Trabzon, and Selim I's son Suleiman the Magnificent was born in Trabzon on November 6, 1494. The Ottoman government often appointed local Chepni and Laz beys as the regional beylerbey. It is also recorded that some Bosniak beys were also appointed by the Sublime Porte as the regional beylerbeys in Trabzon. The Beylerbeylik of Trabzon (Trabzon Beylerbeyli\u011fi) had always sent troops for the Ottoman campaigns in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nTrebizond had a wealthy merchant class during the late Ottoman period, and the local Christian minority had a substantial influence in terms of culture, economy and politics. A number of European consulates were opened in the city due to its importance in regional trade and commerce. In the first half of the 19th century, Trebizond even became the main port for Persian exports. However, the opening of the Suez Canal greatly diminished the international trading position of the city. In the last decades of the 19th century, the city saw some demographic changes. Many residents from the wider region (mostly Christians, but also some Jews and Greek or Turkish speaking Muslims) started to migrate to the Crimea and southern Ukraine, in search for farmland or employment in one of the booming cities along the northern and eastern coasts of the Black Sea. Among these migrants were the grandparents of Bob Dylan and Greek politicians and artists. At the same time, thousands of Muslim refugees from the Caucasus arrived in the city, especially after 1864, in what is known as the Circassian genocide.\nNext to Constantinople, Smyrna (now Izmir) and Salonika (now Thessaloniki), Trebizond was one of the cities where western cultural and technological innovations were first introduced to the Ottoman Empire. In 1835, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions opened the Trebizond Mission station that it occupied from 1835 to 1859 and from 1882 to at least 1892.  Hundreds of schools were constructed during the first half of the 19th century, giving the region one of the highest literacy rates of the empire. The city got a post office in 1845. New churches and mosques were built in the second half of the 19th century, as well as the first theater, public and private printing houses, multiple photo-studios and banks. The oldest known photographs of the city center date from the 1860s and depict one of the last camel trains from Persia.\nBetween one and two thousand Armenians are believed to have been killed in the Trebizond vilayet during the Hamidian massacres of 1895. While this number was low in comparison to other Ottoman provinces, its impact on the Armenian community in the city was large. Many prominent Armenian residents, among them scholars, musicians, photographers and painters, decided to migrate towards the Russian Empire or France. The large Greek population of the city was not affected by the massacre. Ivan Aivazovsky made the painting Massacre of the Armenians in Trebizond 1895 based on the events. Due to the high number of Western Europeans in the city, news from the region was being reported on in many European newspapers. These western newspapers were in turn also very popular among the residents of the city.\n\nOttoman era paintings and drawings of Trebizond\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1901 the harbour was equipped with cranes by Stothert & Pitt of Bath in England. In 1912 the S\u00fcmer Opera House was opened on the central Meydan square, being one of the first in the empire. The city lost many young male citizens at the Battle of Sarikamish in the winter of 1914\u201315.  The coastal region between the city and the Russian frontier was the site of key battles between the Ottoman and Russian armies during the Trebizond Campaign, part of the Caucasus Campaign of World War I. A bombardment of the city in 1915 by the Russian navy cost the lives of 1300 citizens.In July 1915, most of the adult male Armenians of the city were marched off south in five convoys, towards the mines of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane, never to be seen again. Other victims of the Armenian Genocide were reportedly taken out to sea in boats which were then capsized.The Russian army landed at Atina, east of Rize on March 4, 1916. Lazistan Sanjak fell within two days. However, due to heavy guerrilla resistance around Of and \u00c7aykara some 50 km to the east of Trabzon, it took a further 40 days for the Russian army to advance west. The Ottoman administration of Trabzon foresaw the fall of the city and called for a meeting with community leaders, where they handed control of the city to Greek metropolitan bishop Chrysantos Philippidis. Chrysantos promised to protect the Muslim population of the city. Ottoman forces retreated from Trabzon, and on April 15 the city was taken without a fight by the Russian Caucasus Army under command of Grand Duke Nicholas and Nikolai Yudenich. Many adult Turkish males left the city out of fear for reprisals, even though governor Chrysantos included them in his administration. According to some sources the Russians banned Muslim mosques, and forced Turks, who were the largest ethnic group living in the city, to leave Trabzon. However, already during the Russian occupation many Turks who had fled to surrounding villages started to return to the city, and governor Chrysantos helped them to re-establish their facilities such as schools, to the dismay of the Russians. During the Russian Revolution of 1917 Russian soldiers in the city turned to rioting, with officers commandeering Trebizonian ships to flee the scene. The Russian Army ultimately retreated from the city and the rest of eastern and northeastern Anatolia. In December 1918 Trabzon deputy Haf\u0131z Mehmet gave a speech at the Ottoman parliament in which he blamed the former governor of Trebizond Vilayet Cemal Azmi \u2013 who had fled to Germany after the Russian invasion \u2013 for orchestrating the Armenian Genocide in the city in 1915, by means of drowning. Subsequently, a series of war crimes trials were held in Trebizond in early 1919 (see Trebizond during the Armenian Genocide). Among others, Cemal Azmi was sentenced to death in absentia.\n\nDuring the Turkish War of Independence several Christian Pontic Greek communities in the Trebizond vilayet rebelled against the new army of Mustafa Kemal (notably in Bafra and Santa), but when nationalist Greeks came to Trabzon to proclaim revolution, they were not received with open arms by the local Pontic Greek population of the city. At the same time the Muslim population of the city, remembering their protection under Greek governor Crhysantos, protested the arrest of prominent Christians. Liberal delegates of Trebizond opposed the election of Mustafa Kemal as the leader of the Turkish revolution at the Erzurum Congress. The governor and mayor of Trebizond were appalled by the violence against Ottoman Greek subjects, and the government of Trabzon thus refused arms to Mustafa Kemal's henchman Topal Osman, who was responsible for mass murders in the western Pontus. Osman was forced out of the city by armed Turkish port-workers. Following the war and the annulment of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres (1920), which was replaced by the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), Trebizond became part of the new Turkish republic. The efforts of the pro-Ottoman, anti-nationalist population of Trebizond only postponed the inevitable, because the national governments of Turkey and Greece agreed to a mutual forced population exchange. This exchange included well over one hundred thousand Greeks from Trebizond and the vicinity, to the relatively new Greek state. During the war Trebizond parliamentarian Ali \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Bey was one of the leading figures of the first Turkish opposition party. Through his newspaper Tan, \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc and his colleagues publicized their critiques of the Kemalist government, such as its violence towards Greeks during the population exchange.\n\nTopal Osman's men would eventually murder parliamentarian \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc for his criticism of the nationalist government of Mustafa Kemal. Topal Osman was later sentenced to death and killed while resisting arrest. After pressure from the opposition his headless body was hanged by his foot in front of the Turkish parliament. Ali \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Bey, who had studied in Deniz Harp Okulu (Turkish Naval Academy) and worked as a journalist in the United Kingdom, is seen as a hero by the people of Trabzon, while in neighboring Giresun there is a statue of his murderer Topal Osman.\nDuring World War II shipping activity was limited because the Black Sea had again become a war zone. Hence, the most important export products, tobacco and hazelnuts, could not be sold and living standards degraded.\nAs a result of the general development of the country, Trabzon has developed its economic and commercial life. The coastal highway and a new harbour have increased commercial relations with central Anatolia, which has led to some growth. However, progress has been slow in comparison to the western and the southwestern parts of Turkey.\nTrabzon is famous throughout Turkey for its anchovies called hamsi, which are the main meal in many restaurants in the city. Major exports from Trabzon include hazelnuts and tea.\nThe city still has a sizable community of Greek-speaking Muslims, most of whom are originally from the vicinities of Tonya, S\u00fcrmene and \u00c7aykara. However, the Pontic Greek language (known as Romeiaka or \u03a0\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac, Pontiaka) is spoken mostly by the older generations.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nTrabzon Province has a total area of 4,685 square kilometres (1,809 sq mi) and is bordered by the provinces of Rize, Giresun and G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane. The total area is 22.4% plateau and 77.6% hills. The Pontic Mountains pass through the Trabzon Province.\nTrabzon used to be an important reference point for navigators in the Black Sea during harsh weather conditions. The popular expression \"perdere la Trebisonda\" (losing Trebizond) is still commonly used in the Italian language to describe situations in which the sense of direction is lost. The Italian maritime republics such as Venice and in particular Genoa were active in the Black Sea trade for centuries.Trabzon has four lakes: Uzung\u00f6l, \u00c7ak\u0131rg\u00f6l, Sera and Haldizen Lakes. There are several streams, but no rivers in Trabzon.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTrabzon has a climate typical of the Black Sea region with plentiful precipitation. Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, it has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa) Summers are warm and humid, and the average maximum temperature is around 26.7 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F) in August. Winters are cool and damp, and the lowest average minimum temperature is around 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F) in January. Trabzon's summers are warmer than oceanic classifications, but the narrow fluctuations in temperature render a significant influence from the sea. As with other major cities on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, Trabzon is situated right on the waterfront, thus allowing for the additional 1\u20132 \u00b0C (1.8\u20133.6 \u00b0F) enough to surpass the threshold to be classified as subtropical. In comparison, only 1 or 2 percent of the province is classified as subtropical, the majority being oceanic (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) followed by humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfb), due to the immediate elevation increase starting from the coast, a typical characteristic of the Black Sea coast of Turkey. The Pontic Alps get a significant amount of snow during winters. The temperatures may drop as low as -30 \u00b0C (-22 \u00b0F). In some places the snow can stay on the ground during summer months. Trabzon's weather station also sees tendencies of a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa), but with only one month below 40 mm (1.6 in) rainfall in summer it just fails to qualify.\nPrecipitation is heaviest in autumn and winter, with a marked reduction in the summer months, a microclimatic condition of the city center compared to the rest of the region. Snowfall is quite common between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two, and it can be heavy once it snows.\nThe water temperature, like in the rest of the Black Sea coast of Turkey, is always cool and fluctuates between 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) and 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) throughout the year.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAs of 1920, the port at Trabzon was considered \"the most important of the Turkish Black Sea ports\" by the British. It traded as far as Tabriz and Mosul. As of 1911, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey signed an agreement to develop a harbor at the port. When the Russians occupied Trabzon, a mole was built. They built a breakwater and were responsible for creating an extended pier, making loading and unloading easier. In 1920, Trabzon produced linen cloth, silver filagree, tanning and small amounts of cotton, silk and wool. Tobacco and hazelnuts were exported. The tobacco produced in Trabzon was called Trebizond-Platana. It was described as having \"large leaves and a bright colour.\" Trabzon was known for producing poor quality cereals, most which were grown for local use.Trabzon produced a white green bean, which was sold in Europe. It was, as of 1920, the only vegetable exported out of the province. Poultry farming was also popular in Trabzon. Sericulture was seen in the area before 1914. The area produced copper, silver, zinc, iron and manganese. Copper was kept for local use by coppersmiths. During the Balkan Wars production ceased due to poor exportation and fuel supplies.Trabzon Airport opened in 1957.\n\n\n== People ==\n\nThe current ethnic background of the people of Trabzon is mostly Turkish. There are also descendants of Circassian muhajiris in the city, as well as smaller number of Laz people, Muslim Greeks (Romeyka-speakers) and Armenians (Hemshin). Local Turks are mostly of Chepni Turkmen origin. The main language of these ethnic groups is Turkish. Modern migration since the dissolution of the Soviet Union has brought a significant number of Russians, Ukrainians and people from the Caucasus (mostly Georgia) into the city. Russian language shops and facilities can be found in the town.\nPontic Greek has been spoken in the region since early antiquity. The local dialect developed along its own lines and is today partly intelligible to speakers of Standard Greek. It was spoken mainly by a Greek Orthodox multi-ethnic population up to the population exchange; nearly all speakers of this local variant of Pontic Greek are now Muslims. A very similar dialect is spoken by a community of about 400 speakers, descendants of Christians from the Of valley now living in Greece in the village of Nea Trapezounta (New Trebizond), today part of Katerini, Central Macedonia.Laz people, who are aboriginal to this area, also live in Trabzon. Numerous villages inside and out of Trabzon of the Laz date back as early as the period of Queen Tamar's rule (Georgian: \u10d7\u10d0\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8, also transliterated as T'amar or Thamar; c. 1160 \u2013 18 January 1213) in the newly unified Kingdom of Georgia. During the Queen's rule, sizeable groups of immigrating Georgians moved to Trabzon where they continue to preserve their native tongue. There was an Armenian community in Trebizond as early as the 7th century.During the 13th and 14th centuries, numerous Armenian families migrated there from Ani. Robert W. Edwards published part of an early 15th-century diary from the Castilian ambassador who visited Trabzon and compared the churches of the Greek and Armenian communities.  It was stated by the ambassador that the Armenians, who were not well-liked by the Greeks, had a population large enough to support a resident bishop.  According to Ronald C. Jennings, in the early 16th century, Armenians made up approximately 13 percent of the city's population. At present, Trabzon does not have an Armenian-speaking community.\nThe Chepni people, a tribe of Oghuz Turks who played an important role in the history of the eastern Black Sea area in the 13th and 14th centuries, live in the \u015ealpazar\u0131 (A\u011fasar valley) region of the Trabzon Province. Very little has been written on the Turkification of the area. There are no historical records of any considerable Turkish-speaking groups in the Trabzon area until the late 15th century, with the exception of the Chepnis. The original Greek (and in some regions Armenian) speakers imposed features from their mother language into the Turkish spoken in the region. Heath W. Lowry's work with Halil \u0130nalc\u0131k on Ottoman tax books (Tahrir Defteri) provides detailed demographic statistics for the city of Trabzon and its surrounding areas during the Ottoman period.\nIt is possible that the majority of the population of Trabzon and Rize (and other ancient Greek colonies in the Pontus region) \u2014 except up to the time of the Chepni Turk immigration waves \u2014 consisted of indigenous Caucasian tribes (the Colchians and the Laz) who had been partly Hellenized religiously and linguistically. Michael Meeker stresses the cultural resemblances (e.g. in village structure, house types, and pastoral techniques) between the Eastern Black Sea coast and the areas in the Caucasus proper.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nTrabzon has a number of tourist attractions, some of them dating back to the times of the ancient empires that once existed in the region. In the city itself, one can find a hub of shops, stalls and restaurants surrounding the Meydan, a square in the center of the city, which includes a tea garden.\n\nThe Hagia Sophia (Turkish: Ayasofya M\u00fczesi), a stunning Byzantine church, is probably the town's most important tourist attraction.\nTrabzon Castle ruins are visible in the town but cannot be visited as they fall in a military zone.  The outside wall of the castle now serves as the back wall of a military building.\nThe \"Atat\u00fcrk K\u00f6\u015fk\u00fc\" is a villa built in 1890 by a local Greek merchant. In 1924 Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk stayed in the villa during his visit to Trabzon. He stayed there again in 1937. It houses period rooms and serves as a monument to the memory of the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey.\nBoztepe Park is a small park and tea garden on the hills above Trabzon that has a panoramic view of nearly the entire city. The terrain in Trabzon is ascending in such a way that although the view is far above that of the buildings below, it is still close enough to be able to observe the flow of traffic and the people moving about in the city.\nUzun Sokak is one of the most crowded streets of Trabzon.\nTrabzon Museum is located in the town centre and offers interesting exhibits on the history of the region, including an impressive collection of Byzantine artifacts.\nTrabzon's Bazaar District offers interesting shopping opportunities on ancient narrow streets, continuing from Kundurac\u0131lar Street from the Meydan (town square).\nKostaki Mansion is located to the north of Zeytinlik near Uzun Sokak.Other sites of the city include: Fatih Mosque (originally the Panagia Khrysokephalos Church), Yeni Cuma Mosque (originally the Agios Eugenios Church), Nakip Mosque (originally the Agios Andreas Church), H\u00fcsn\u00fc K\u00f6ktu\u011f Mosque (originally the Agios Elevtherios Church), \u0130skender Pasha Mosque, Semerciler Mosque, \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 Mosque, G\u00fclbahar Hatun Mosque and T\u00fcrbe (commissioned by Sultan Selim I), Kalepark (originally Leonkastron).\nWithin Trabzon Province, the main attractions are the S\u00fcmela Monastery (i. e. the Monastery of the Panagia Soumel\u00e1) and the Uzung\u00f6l lake. The monastery is built on the side of a very steep mountain overlooking the green forests below and is about 50 kilometres (31 miles) south of the city. Uzung\u00f6l is known for its natural environment and scenery. Other sites of interest in the broader region include:\n\nKaymakl\u0131 Monastery, a formerly Armenian Monastery of the All-Saviour (arm. \u0531\u0574\u0565\u0576\u0561\u0583\u0580\u056f\u056b\u0579 \u054e\u0561\u0576\u0584, Amenaprgi\u010d Vank),\nK\u0131zlar Monastery of Panagia Theoskepastos (the God-veiled Virgin),\nKu\u015ftul Monastery of Gregorios Peristereotas (gr. \u0399\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac \u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1, Ier\u00e1 Mon\u00ed tou Ag\u00edou Georg\u00edou Peristere\u00f3ta),\nVazelon Monastery of Agios Savvas (Ma\u015fatl\u0131k),\nCave churches of Agia Anna (Little Ayvas\u0131l), Sotha (St. John), Agios Theodoros, Agios Konstantinos, Agios Christophoros, Agia Kyriak\u00ed, Agios Michail and Panagia Tzita churches.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nFolk dancing is still very much in evidence in the Black Sea region. The \"Horon\" is a famous dance that is indigenous to the city and its surrounding area. It is performed by men, women, the young and elderly alike; in festivities, local weddings and harvest times. While similar to Russian Cossack dances in terms of vividness, the Trabzon folk dance is probably indigenous to the eastern Black Sea region, which has an impressive variety of folk music.\nThe people of Trabzon have a reputation for being religiously conservative and nationalist. Many Trabzonites generally show a strong sense of loyalty to their family, friends, religion and country. Atat\u00fcrk selected his presidential guards from Trabzon and the neighbouring city of Giresun because of their fierce fighting ability and their loyalty.\nOutside of the relatively urban space of Trabzon proper, and within parts of it as well, rural traditions from the Black Sea village life are still thriving. These include traditional gender roles, social conservatism, hospitality and a willingness to help strangers; and all aspects, both positive and negative, of an agrarian lifestyle, such as hard work, poverty, strong family ties, and a closeness to nature.\nThe people of the eastern Black Sea region are also known for their wit and sense of humour; many jokes in Turkey are told about the natives of the Black Sea region Karadeniz f\u0131kralar\u0131 (Black Sea jokes). The character Temel, a universal buffoon figure found in many cultures, forms an important part of the Turkish oral tradition.\nThe city's profile was raised somewhat in the English-speaking world by Dame Rose Macaulay's last novel, The Towers of Trebizond (1956), which is still in print.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nBlack Sea Technical University in Trabzon hosts students from all over Turkey, especially from the Black Sea and East Anatolian regions, as well as students from the Turkic states in Central Asia.\nHistorically the city was a center of Greek culture and education and from 1683 to 1921, a teachers' college operated known as Phrontisterion of Trapezous, which provided a major impetus for the rapid expansion of Greek education throughout the region. The building of this institution (built in 1902) still remains the most impressive Pontic Greek monument in the city and today hosts the Turkish school Anadolu Lisesi.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nTrabzon's regional cuisine is traditionally reliant on fish, especially hamsi (fresh European Anchovy similar to the British Sprat or American Smelt). Trabzon meets 20% of the total fish production in Turkey. Regional dishes include the Ak\u00e7aabat k\u00f6fte (spicy lamb meatball from the Ak\u00e7aabat district), Karadeniz pidesi (canoe shaped pita bread, often filled with ground beef, cheese and eggs), kuymak (a Turkish fondue made with cornmeal, fresh butter and cheese), Vakf\u0131kebir ekme\u011fi (large country-style bread), Tonya tereya\u011f\u0131 (Tonya butter), tava m\u0131s\u0131r ekme\u011fi (deep-dish corn bread) and kara lahana \u00e7orbas\u0131 (bean and cabbage soup). Taflan kavurmas\u0131 is a cherry laurel dish served with onions and olive oil. Trabzon is also famous for its hazelnuts. The Black Sea region of Turkey is the world's largest producer of cherry and hazelnut; and a large production area of tea; all of which play an important role in the local cuisine.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Trabzon. The city's top sports club, Trabzonspor, was until 2010 the only Turkish football club outside \u0130stanbul to win the S\u00fcper Lig (six times), which was previously (until Trabzonspor's first championship title in the 1975\u201376 season) won only by the \"Big Three\" clubs of Istanbul, namely Galatasaray, Fenerbah\u00e7e and Be\u015fikta\u015f. Due to Trabzonspor's success, the decades-old term \"Big Three\" which defined the most successful football clubs in Turkey had to be modified into the \"Big Four\". \nTrabzonspor is also one of the most successful Turkish clubs in the European Cups, managing to beat numerous prominent teams such as Barcelona, Inter, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Olympique Lyonnais. Renowned former players of Trabzonspor include \u015eenol G\u00fcne\u015f, Lars Olsen and Shota Arveladze.\nTrabzon hosted the First Edition of the Black Sea Games in July 2007 and the 2011 European Youth Summer Olympic Festival.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nTrabzon is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmasya (ancient Amaseia, capital of the Pontic Greeks during classical antiquity)\nAnatolian Tigers\nBlack Sea Region\nKemen\u00e7e of the Black Sea\nKolbast\u0131\nWorld Trade Center Trabzon\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\nPrinceton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites eds.

        "wiki": "Paul Curtis Steelman (born September 23, 1955), a native of Atlantic City, New Jersey, is an American architect who is recognized as a designer of global entertainment, hospitality, and gaming architecture based in Las Vegas, Nevada and Macau. Paul has designed buildings for the mavericks of the gaming industry, including Kirk Kerkorian, Steve Wynn, Sheldon Adelson, Francis Lui, Lawrence Ho, Tan Sri Dato' Lim Kok Thay, Tan Sri Dr Chen Lip Keong, Prince Albert of Monaco, Bob Stupak, Frank Modica, Phil Satre, Derek Stevens and Stanley Ho.His firm, Steelman Partners, designed the $240 million Sands Macau casino resort which was notable for going from \"blueprint to opening in 600 days\", building a reputation for rapid development sometimes referred to as \"Sands speed.\" The project won praise for its \"bright, airy design\" and sunken stage which \"allows everyone in the theater to get a spectacular view of the entertainment.\" According to Architectural Record, Steelman's firm had total revenue in 2016 of over $48 million and design revenues and in 2016 rated his company as the 91st largest architectural firm.\n\n\n== Beginnings ==\nSteelman was born on September 23, 1955 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He grew up in the small beach community of Longport, New Jersey and graduated from Atlantic City High School in 1973. Paul began working as an architect in his father Edgar's architectural practice before graduating from Clemson University in 1977. He was employed by Wasleski Steelman, the city of Atlantic City, Golden Nugget Atlantic City Corporation and Resorts International, Atlantic City. In 1987 he founded his own firm.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nSteelman worked on Steve Wynn's Mirage hotel which in 1989 became the first Strip hotel to focus on eating and entertainment in addition to gaming tables. Since then, he has worked on numerous projects, often in collaboration with casino developers.\nIn 1987 he founded his own architectural firm, Paul Steelman LTD, in Las Vegas, Nevada. His design mentors were Joel Bergman and Henry Conversano. The firm, now called Steelman Partners, owns and operates several other design companies including DSAA (interior design), Shop12 (lighting, theater, ride and attraction design), Inviro Studios (film animations), MARQI (branding and corporate identity), Competition Interactive (slot machine design and manufacturer), Steelman Development (commercial real estate), Steelman Aviation (airplane charter and management), and PCEG (EB5 Regional Center).\nSteelman Partners has offices in Las Vegas, Nevada; Macau PRC; Zhuhai PRC; Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; and Amsterdam, Netherlands.Paul Steelman and his firm have designed many casino projects around the world that include the following: Sands Macau; Four Seasons Macau; City of Dreams Shopping Center Macau; Hard Rock Casino Macau; Galaxy Macau; Harrahs, California; Harrahs AK-Chin, Arizona; Harrahs Tunica, Mississippi; Harrahs Vicksburg, Mississippi; Harrahs Kansas City; Caesar's Indiana; Caesars Magical Empire, Las Vegas; JW Marriott, Las Vegas; Showboat, Las Vegas; Stratosphere, Las Vegas; Casinos Locarno, Switzerland; Thun Casino, Switzerland; Casino Rheinfelden, Switzerland; Swiss Casino Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Casino St Gallen, Switzerland;  MGM Casino and Theme Park, Las Vegas; Treasure Island Expansions and Renovations, Las Vegas; Beau Rivage, Mississippi, Hard Rock Biloxi, Mississippi, Foxwoods Resort Casino, Connecticut; Showboat Atlantic City, New Jersey; Steel Pier Atlantic City, New Jersey; Solaire Resort & Casino, Philippines; Sochi Casino, Russia; Grand Casino Riviera, France; Casino Grand Via, Spain; Grand Casino, Finland; The Grand Ho Tram, Vietnam; Star Gold Coast, Australia; Seminole Casino, Florida; Sun City Entertainment Center, South Africa, The Casino at the Empire, London; London Clubs, Bahamas; Nagaworld, Cambodia.Currently Steelman is designing Resorts World Las Vegas; Circa Resort and Casino; Casino Van Dom, Vietnam; Naga 3 at NagaWorld, Cambodia; Imperial Pacific, Saipan; Lotus Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam; Genting Malaysia Master Plan; Galaxy Media Center, Macau; Galaxy 1000 Room Hotel, Macau; Naga Vladivostok; and Scotts Valley Casino in California.Steelman worked for billionaire Phil Ruffin on designing the a 2,750-room casino called the Montreux, an entertainment property modeled after a Swiss-themed lakefront hotel which includes a 465-foot-tall observation wheel which \"scoops riders from the floor above the casino,\" according to a report in Forbes magazine. The design's interior was a \"mix of glass artwork, waterfalls and reflective surfaces,\" similar to boutique hotels in New York or Los Angeles, according to a report in the Las Vegas Sun. Steelman's firm designed a $6.2 billion tourism development in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in 2010. A reporter commented on his design style:\n\nSteelman is wiser than most when it comes to the logistics of moving gamblers through sin dens ... Steelman has, over the last 20 years, come up with 70-odd design rules to keep visitors in a gleeful state as they evenly spread their dollars among betting tables, shops, theaters and restaurants.\nOne Steelman design invention was a sleek transformable ballroom inside a casino that can undergo several makeovers within a single day, enabling event organizers to use the space for different purposes, and transform it in less than two hours:\n\nHold a fashion show in the morning, a poker tournament in the afternoon and a boxing match at night. The ideal length for any spectacle in a casino is less than 90 minutes.\nSteelman received a gaming manufacturing and distribution license from the State of Nevada on February 23, 2017 for his subsidiary company, Competition Interactive LLC. Competition Interactive has designed a new skill based slot machine named Running Rich Racing, which will be placed in casinos in 2017.Steelman's firm has employed architects who later founded their own architecture firms, such as Gemie Knisely of GK3 and Kim Daoust and Jordan Ba\u00f1ares of Tandem. Steelman was featured in Asian Gaming annual publication entitled \"Asian Gaming 50\" as 32nd in 2008 and as 33rd in 2009.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPaul Steelman is married to Maryann Steelman (RN Registered Nurse).

          "Probably the most upscale casino on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. This can also be translated to most expensive, but if you're willing to pay the premium for nicer surroundings, this is the place for you. With the addition of the Top Golf \u2026",
          "We love the beau, bo. Me and my wife have been visiting here for years and it never gets old",
          "This is my favorite casino/hotel I've been to so far.  The payouts are really good on the slot machines.  The hotel rooms are fantastic and they even give you room comps if you play enough on the slots or tables.  The food is great too!  Keep up the good work Beau Rivage!",
          "Exceptional location! Beautiful well-maintained rooms with an incredible view of the ocean. Bathroom is large enough to have a party.the casino is not crowded and even though smoking is allowed doesn't smell like it",
          "Nice hotel.  Clean, large, modern rooms.  Very comfortable.  Casino, however, didn't have as many penny slots that I could play, as I am not a big gambler.",
          "Great food. Slots are easier closer to weekend and holidays. Otherwise expect to pay a lot for that free drink. If staying overnight, bring your own blanket. The ones provided are very flimsy.",
          "I feel that most of these casinos are doing the best they can to accommodate everyone but I can't afford to play table games here or any other casino we've went to . Only 3 can play on table and minimum bets are 15 bucks and only about 1/4 of the slots are available to play. Food is still fantastic !",
          "First class resort. All employees make you feel like they want you there",
          "Rooms are OK...could be cleaner. We found hair pins on the floor which could be a danger to my 11 month old. No microwave, fridge or coffee pot in room. Bed was a trifle too soft for my taste but not too uncomfortable. Buffet was good",
          "Excitement and fun with family. Friendly staff and good drinks! Highly recommend a visit.",
          "The casino is amazing, but  the restaurant was awful  ......we were greeted  rudely by a waitress  ,we sat waiting for 10 mins  and not one person  came to the table  ,so we walked out....I wd think for the price of all items on the menu they would be a little nicer.....thanks to the hostess for being  nice",
          "Beautiful place to visit exclent casino floor, I would have to say it's definitely a 5 star casino.",
          "We Love this place for my Mom and Hubby's birthday during the Summer. Access to Beach, Casino is ALOT of Fun. My son has fun at Pool, and I enjoy relaxing. Hope to see you guys in June 2021 for my Mom's 65th birthday.",
          "The beds are like heaven! Service was good. Everything was clean and nice. Had a great time. Oh...except the buffet wasn't great. The hostess was a little curt and our table was given to someone else when we went  to get our food, but the \u2026",
          "Beautiful lobby with bunch of flowers decorations...Most of the stores and restaurants included The Buffet are still closed due to Covid19...Casino & the hotel are open...a lot less patrons than usual for a beautiful weekend on the summer holidays...a lot of people on the beaches  : )",
          "The food was really good. The best I've had at a casino. The game room is a little pricey for what it is. The decorations are always on point especially at Christmas time. I make a trip at least once a month to go eat and play.",
          "The Beau is a beautiful property.  Not sure if the dealers were just having bad days but I dont like sitting down at a table and hearing, No this is not the table with the bonus it is over there, thats the table everybody wants.  I never \u2026",
          "Been a Pearl member 4 yrs. They just blew a siren and kicked everyone out of the pool because of a chance of rain. Last September we all drank in the pool in a rain storm. At present we are in room watching rain pass by about 3 miles North \u2026",
          "Beautiful property and amenities!  875 bar server Trenay was amazing and very attentive ...a true professional when it comes to customer service.  The valet attendant Blake was extremely courteous, dressed well and had perfect manners... \u2026",
          "Beautiful casino.  Great air filtration as well.  They allow smoking, but it doesn't smell like an ashtray.   Had a great meal at the Italian restaurant.   Definitely worth a trip.",
          "For example... After tipping a dealer around $100 as I played, he acted offended and told me as i left that  I was playing too slow. No one else was at the table....jerk. \n\nMost of the dealers are actually pretty good,  but a third were not. I expect better.",
          "Still just as beautiful as the first time I went. I can't wait to go back to the Beau!",
          "I love to stay at hotel of Beau Rivage Resort.  I plan to see Chicago in concert in March and then Celtic women in April.  The food is wonderful.  The spa and resort by pool and sea is relaxing.",
          "We made a trip over for the weekend and for the fight. While at the other casino, we were not able to get served by a single waitress. Within maybe 10 minutes we had a waitress coming up behind us after we started playing. The new player \u2026",
          "The pool bar continues to be a disappointment. It takes entirely too long to order a drink. My husband's beer was warm and my margarita was awful. Will try a different hotel/casino next time we stay in Biloxi.",
          "BEAUTIFUL place to stay. Definitely recommend, only thing is if you dont have reservations GOOD LUCK ARGUING WITH SECURITY because for some godforsaken reason you cant park your car for 5 minutes while you check in \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd2d\ud83d\udcaf",
          "Let me start by saying my wife and I are big MGM Group supporters and vist Vegas several times a year. Beau is not Bellagio,  but Beau is a fantastic hotel, with universally friendly and helpful staff, Eight75 is a great bar and a fun night \u2026",
          "Family friendly, for a reopening stage it's doing great just needs more house keeping employees",
          "It was very nice and classy. There was app a lot to do in both the casino and resort.",
          "Our second time at the Beau Rivage. This time they went out of their way to make our stay amazing. After a long drive from Washington State, this was great. We were upgraded to the Cypress Suite as our comp room for the night. Add 150 in \u2026",
          "Went to the lunch buffet. The choices were mediocre at best. Definitely not worth $15 per person. Amazing table service though.",
          "The staff questioned me as if I shouldn\u2019t have been there several times! For the price,the room was somewhat small & it had no microwave or refrigerator!! I will say the room was clean.",
          "Ayla made it a pleasant day with her extraordinary customer service.",
          "Great hotel great service, low payouts, poor quality food in buffet, snack bar excellent quality of food but poor service.",
          "It was beautiful clean and the staff was friendly. The only thing I would ln d change would be to bring back the roomservice.",
          "This was the first time we stayed at the hotel, we had been to the casino before. The hotel is beautiful and so clean, the rooms were very nice and also clean and fresh. We enjoyed the brunch before we left the next morning and that is a 5 star review in itself. We will be back again!",
          "Great place to gamble. Beautiful scenery inside. We were there the day before they shut down due to the virus. Will miss being able to go there ib next few weeks.",
          "The food on the buffet is not that good. The service was good though. When I was playing the slots, I had to wait forever for a waitress to show up to bring me a drink. She was very friendly though and it really wasn't her fault. She was \u2026",
          "We went to the Christmas in the Air show and went to Terrace Cafe afterwards. I can say that we definitely enjoyed ourselves here. My daughter was dancing and singing during the whole show and myself and husband enjoyed the show. My son is \u2026",
          "The lady at the front desk was amazing last night at 3am. I played poker all night and ended up needing a room. Many of the other hotels wouldn\u2019t work with me because it was so late. The beau comped next a room so I could sleep peacefully \u2026",
          "Beaux Rivage is great, smells nice inside and wonderful service and gaming floor.",
          "Had a great time the only thing is I didn't get but 1 drink in 3 hours an I had to go look for her",
          "Second time e experiencing the casino.  Service is above average.  The food at the buffett was good.  The wife won on the slots so I would have to give the gambling a thumbs up.",
          "This is for that one person researching who wonders if things have changed after Covid? The answer is 100% Yes! I normally go about five times a year to The Beau Rivage. I booked a three night stay July 3-6th and lost all my gambling money \u2026",
          "Love it first time going. Gives you free play for new comers.",
          "Had a great time. Food was delicious. Staff very accommodating. Wonderful shops in hotel. I was able to enjoy the sunrise and sunset from my room.",
          "My how the mighty have fallen! I used to tell people if you wanted to gamble in Biloxi you need to go to the Beau rivage, it was the Bellagio of the gulf coast. Not anymore \n\nDuring the shut down you think they would\u2019ve done something to \u2026",
          "We had a fantastic time here! The atmosphere and surroundings are upscale and clean and the staff is really friendly. The food is good, you can get four-star dining at the steakhouse or other restaurants, or you can get snack bar or diner \u2026",
          "Much fun was had by all! Beautiful pool area, great restaurant choices. The ventilation could be better on the casino floor, but they do have a non-smoking area which is nice! Friendly employees \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Stopped in for a weekend overnight trip and found that some areas of the casino were deplorable in terms of maintenance and cleanliness.  I get the feeling that the maintenance staff is trying to hold together a dated infrastructure.  The \u2026",
          "This is the best gaming and hotel in Mississippi food is #1 in this town.can't wait to return!!!",
          "Employees were nice, room was clean and relaxing, and the amount of attractions and restaurants in the hotel was great but, my only complaint was that there was a man in the hallway (who seemed to be drunk) on my floor knocking on different \u2026",
          "We ate at the Terrace Cafe in the front of the hotel on 12/27/19 and our experience was wonderful.  The food was plentiful and tasted superb.  But the best part of the meal was the service we received.  Our server was Kelly P and she was \u2026",
          "Surprised there weren\u2019t enough amenities facecloths for a room that accommodates 4. Ie coffee, linens, water, etc.",
          "Well, it's a casino, it's in Biloxi,MS. of all places, kinda like Las Vegas but on warfare. It's a good enough casino, clean, never really all that busy and the food ain't to bad but for the price could be better. In short, got some extra \u2026",
          "Had fun at the slots!(could have won a little more, hint, hint) Buffet could be a little fresher! Hadn't been in 20 years. Do a lot of \nVegas m-life. I will go back to both..great atmosphere!",
          "I received a free flight down to Biloxi (from Chicago) and stayed four nights at the Beau Rivage.  The customer service is amazing. Every employee I interacted with was so polite and professional and seemingly wanted to go out of their way to help. Seriously, a top notch staff.",
          "Really nice place.. great restaurants.  Really nice rooms.  Only downside is the prices for little things, just no reason a cup of coffee should cost $4, but beside that we really had a great time",
          "Would love to go back and play again,lost but we had a good time loosing it. ( Lol ) Now the Buffet was Excellent,to die for. Also All the Free Drinks you can handle while Playing.",
          "Beau feels catered to lower middle class who thinks they're upper middle or deserve more than they have. Mediocre food at lavish restaurant prices, dated decor meant to WOW a certain generation that's no longer the majority. Don't get me wrong, it is a nice place. Just seems to be behind on the times.",
          "Awesome. Hands down the nicest casino on the coast. Clubs are top notch. Plenty of table action and all the best slots. 2 \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "It's ok but definitely not worth the four hour drive.",
          "I like the casino and the inside of property. Stores are very nice. Atmosphere is awesome. I use to come by when Steve owned it.Still very beautiful. Will try to schedule again thanks.",
          "Beautifully decorated every season. Large Casino floor, lots of venues but again limited do to pandemic.",
          "Nice place, great sports bar, nice steak joint and hibachi restaurants. Lots of high limit slots for the floor space for those who prefer them as well. Drink service was good to very good depending where you were sitting but typical MGM ABINBEV floor beers unfortunately.",
          "I did not stay in a room there but came to play in the casino. The staff is very helpful but I wanted to highlight a wonderful employee named Alesha. Alesha is a Restroom attendant that greeted everyone with a big smile and kind words to \u2026",
          "So beautifully decorated for the Christmas holidays but light all casinos tight slots. I use to go 2 or 3 times a year and at least win play back to keep you playing but no more. The rooms are beautiful the service is great.",
          "Beautiful hotel and friendly staff.  BR Prime was awesome both food and service, Terrace Cafe has a limited menu but the food and service was good, but Dinner Buffet left much to be desired.  Not much to do unless you want to gamble all day \u2026",
          "This hotel location is great! The food & drinks are very expensive. Way over priced. Friendly staff.  The rooms are good size but the beds need replacing. The bedding isn\u2019t fitted & sheets don\u2019t stay in place. The mattress are so old that \u2026",
          "Smells good. Orderly. Lots of security. Good games. But details are starting to show their age. Could use a major maintenance going over.",
          "Nice casino and hotel. The restaurants are all good too. I didn't try the buffet, but it must of been delicious, people were lining up hours before it opened.",
          "All around fun and excitement win or lose great fun and smiles everywhere",
          "I love the atmosphere here.  It's so beautiful inside. They have many restaurant offerings but I always end up at the snack shop. Best egg salad and pasta salad side on the coast! A little pricey but the quality is excellent.  Planning on trying Stalla (italian) on my next trip.",
          "We had stayed at another casino Hotel on Thursday.Their bed was too hard.  Beau Rivage had a nicer bed .  But I did not love the pillows. But we all enjoyed our rooms.Clean spacious and Very Quiet. Great view.",
          "Since we were there at a bad time, many things were shut down but still a fun trip.  Just wish we has a better beach view.",
          "This is a hidden gem, lots of slits and plenty of tables. Pleasant enough dealers and some really good high end food. The buffet was a tad bit weak but the steak house and the Italian restaurant were both excellent. I highly recommend them \u2026",
          "Excellent service & accommodations! Quick & easy check in. Room service food wasn't the best and the wait time was 50 mins for a wine bottle opener, but the resort itself made up for that. The valet and room service attendants were top notch. Will definitely return!",
          "What an awesome place to spend our Christmas Eve. This casino was by far the most festive and wonderful with holiday sents to boot. A wonderful photo op for any family. The staff was friendly. You did not have to hunt for a waitress to be served. Many shops that give you a break from gaming. Just an overall wonderful experience.",
          "My wife and I didn't stay here but visited the casino. We would definitely consider staying there though. Our gaming experience was a good one for sure, we were entertained for hours. Thumbs up and we would recommend it.",
          "We always enjoy visiting the Beau Rivage. There are lots of gambling and eating options, or just for a walk thru on the way to one of their spectacular shows. We often meet-at-the-Beau.",
          "The groundskeeper does an incredible job & keeps this the most beautifully kept \"yard\" in Biloxi! Everything here is top of the line.",
          "Hillary at the front desk made our stay amazing!\n\nWe have stayed at this property several times and each time have had a fantastic experience. First of all, I need to give credit to \"Hillary\" at the front desk. She has always made us feel \u2026",
          "Awesome. Everything was perfect. Staff was friendly, courteous, helpful and seemed to want your stay to be a great experience. Can't wait to go back. Ps Terrace cafe was wonderful and delicious and the servings were huge.",
          "I recommend this place. I love the stay. The rooms were amazing. The slots an tables are awesome. Service is great. Beautiful surroundings...all the above.",
          "My self and a friend went to eat the buffet on Sunday the 16th of Feb. The food was sub-par at best, the breakfast items were almost all undercooked and or cold.\n\nThe price was 25$ a person, and honestly I could have gotten more food for \u2026"

        "wiki": "The Alhambra ( (listen), Spanish: [a\u02c8lamb\u027ea]; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u200e, romanized: Al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02be, pronounced [al\u0127am\u02c8ra\u02d0\u0294], lit.\u2009'\"The Red One\"') is a palace and fortress complex located in Granada, Andalusia, Spain. It was originally constructed as a small fortress in AD 889 on the remains of Roman fortifications, and then largely ignored until its ruins were renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar of the Emirate of Granada, who built its current palace and walls with many intricate details. It was converted into a royal palace in 1333 by Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada. After the conclusion of the Christian Reconquista in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where Christopher Columbus received royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered in the Renaissance style. In 1526 Charles I & V commissioned a new Renaissance palace better befitting the Holy Roman Emperor in the revolutionary Mannerist style influenced by humanist philosophy in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid Andalusian architecture, but it was ultimately never completed due to Morisco rebellions in Granada.\nAlhambra's last flowering of Islamic palaces was built for the last Muslim emirs in Spain during the decline of the Nasrid dynasty, who were increasingly subject to the Christian Kings of Castile. After being allowed to fall into disrepair for centuries, the buildings occupied by squatters, Alhambra was rediscovered following the defeat of Napoleon, who had conducted retaliatory destruction of the site. The rediscoverers were first British intellectuals and then other north European Romantic travelers. It is now one of Spain's major tourist attractions, exhibiting the country's most significant and well-known Islamic architecture, together with 16th-century and later Christian building and garden interventions. The Alhambra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Moorish poets described it as \"a pearl set in emeralds\", an allusion to the colour of its buildings and the woods around them. The palace complex was designed with the mountainous site in mind and many forms of technology were considered. The park (Alameda de la Alhambra), which is overgrown with wildflowers and grass in the spring, was planted by the Moors with roses, oranges, and myrtles; its most characteristic feature, however, is the dense wood of English elms brought by the Duke of Wellington in 1812. The park has a multitude of nightingales and is usually filled with the sound of running water from several fountains and cascades. These are supplied through a conduit 8 km (5.0 mi) long, which is connected with the Darro at the monastery of Jesus del Valle above Granada.Despite long neglect, willful vandalism, and some ill-judged restoration, the Alhambra endures as an atypical example of Muslim art in its final European stages, relatively uninfluenced by the direct Byzantine influences found in the Mezquita of C\u00f3rdoba. Most of the palace buildings are quadrangular in plan, with all the rooms opening on to a central court, and the whole reached its present size simply by the gradual addition of new quadrangles, designed on the same principle, though varying in dimensions, and connected with each other by smaller rooms and passages. Alhambra was extended by the different Muslim rulers who lived in the complex. However, each new section that was added followed the consistent theme of \"paradise on earth\". Column arcades, fountains with running water, and reflecting pools were used to add to the aesthetic and functional complexity. In every case, the exterior was left plain and austere. Sun and wind were freely admitted. Blue, red, and a golden yellow, all somewhat faded through lapse of time and exposure, are the colors chiefly employed. The name Alhambra means the red one or the red castle, which refers to the sun-dried bricks that the outer wall is made of.The decoration consists for the upper part of the walls, as a rule, of Arabic inscriptions\u2014mostly poems by Ibn Zamrak and others praising the palace\u2014that are manipulated into geometrical patterns with vegetal background set onto an arabesque setting (\"Ataurique\"). Much of this ornament is carved stucco (plaster) rather than stone. Tile mosaics (\"alicatado\"), with complicated mathematical patterns (\"tracer\u00eda\", most precisely \"lacer\u00eda\"), are largely used as panelling for the lower part. Metal was also not present very mainly. Similar designs are displayed on wooden ceilings (Alfarje). Muqarnas are the main elements for vaulting with stucco, and some of the most accomplished dome examples of this kind are in the Court of the Lions halls. The palace complex is designed in the Nasrid style, the last blooming of Islamic Art in the Iberian Peninsula, that had a great influence on the Maghreb to the present day, and on contemporary Mudejar Art, which is characteristic of western elements reinterpreted into Islamic forms and widely popular during the Reconquista in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAlhambra derives from the Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621 al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  (f.), meaning \"the red one\", the complete form of which was \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064f al-Qal\u02bbat al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  \"the red fortress (qalat)\". The \"Al-\" in \"Alhambra\" means \"the\" in Arabic, but this is ignored in general usage in both English and Spanish, where the name is normally given the definite article.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAround the year 889, forces loyal to Umar ibn Hafsun in revolt against Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi and the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba besieged a small Islamic fortress in Granada held by Saw\u0101r Ben Hamd\u016bn. The first reference to al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  came in lines of poetry attached to an arrow shot over the ramparts, recorded by Ibn Hayyan:\n\nCompleted towards the end of Muslim rule of Spain by Yusuf I (1333\u20131353) and Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada (1353\u20131391), the Alhambra is a reflection of the culture of the last centuries of the Muslim rule of Al Andalus, reduced to the Nasrid Emirate of Granada. It is a place where artists and intellectuals had taken refuge as the Reconquista by Spanish Christians won victories over Al Andalus. The Alhambra integrates natural site qualities with constructed structures and gardens, and is a testament to Moorish culture in Spain and the skills of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian artisans, craftsmen, and builders of their era.\nThe literal translation of Alhambra, \"the red (female),\" reflects the color of the red clay of the surroundings of which the fort is made. The buildings of the Alhambra were originally whitewashed; however, the buildings as seen today are reddish. Another possible origin of the name is the tribal designation of the Nasrid Dynasty, known as the Banu al-Ahmar Arabic: Sons of the Red (male), a sub-tribe of the Arab Qahtanite Banu Khazraj tribe. One of the early Nasrid ancestors was nicknamed Yusuf Al Ahmar (Yusuf the Red) and hence the (Nasrid) fraction of the Banu Khazraj took up the name of Banu al-Ahmar.\n\nThe first reference to the Qal\u2018at al-\u1e24amra was during the battles between the Arabs and the Muladies (people of mixed Arab and European descent) during the rule of the \u2018Abdullah ibn Muhammad (r. 888\u2013912). In one particularly fierce and bloody skirmish, the Muladies soundly defeated the Arabs, who were then forced to take shelter in a primitive red castle located in the province of Elvira, presently located in Granada. According to surviving documents from the era, the red castle was quite small, and its walls were not capable of deterring an army intent on conquering. The castle was then largely ignored until the eleventh century, when its ruins were renovated and rebuilt by Samuel ibn Naghrela, vizier to the emir Badis ben Habus of the Zirid Dynasty of Al Andalus, in an attempt to preserve the small Jewish settlement also located on the natural plateau, Sabikah Hill.\nIbn Nasr, the founder of the Nasrid Dynasty, was forced to flee to Ja\u00e9n to avoid persecution by King Ferdinand III of Castile and the Reconquista supporters working to end Spain's Moorish rule. After retreating to Granada, Ibn-Nasr took up residence at the Palace of Badis ben Habus in the Alhambra. A few months later, he embarked on the construction of a new Alhambra fit for the residence of a sultan. According to an Arabic manuscript since published as the An\u00f3nimo de Granada y Copenhague,\n\nThis year, 1238 Abdallah ibn al-Ahmar climbed to the place called \"the Alhambra\" inspected it, laid out the foundations of a castle and left someone in charge of its construction...\nThe design included plans for six palaces, five of which were grouped in the northeast quadrant forming a royal quarter, two circuit towers, and numerous bathhouses. During the reign of the Nasrid Dynasty, the Alhambra was transformed into a palatine city, complete with an irrigation system composed of acequias for the gardens of the Generalife located outside the fortress. Previously, the old Alhambra structure had been dependent upon rainwater collected from a cistern and from what could be brought up from the Albaic\u00edn. The creation of the Sultan's Canal solidified the identity of the Alhambra as a palace-city rather than a defensive and ascetic structure. The hydraulic system includes two long water channels and several sophisticated elevation devices to bring water onto the plateau.\n\nThe last Nasrid sultan, Muhammad XII of Granada, surrendered the Emirate of Granada in 1492 without the Alhambra itself being attacked when the forces of the Reyes Cat\u00f3licos, King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, took the surrounding territory with a force of overwhelming numbers.\nThe decoration within the palaces comes from the last great period of Andalusian art in Granada. With little of the Byzantine influence of contemporary Abassid architecture, artists endlessly reproduced the same forms and trends, creating a new style that developed over the course of the Nasrid Dynasty. The Nasrids used freely all the stylistic elements that had been created and developed during eight centuries of Muslim rule in the Peninsula, including the Caliphate horseshoe arch, the Almohad sebka (a grid of rhombuses), the Almoravid palm, and unique combinations of them, as well as innovations such as stilted arches and muqarnas (stalactite ceiling decorations). Structurally, the design is simple and does not evince significant innovation. While artistically pleasing it was until the reconquest structurally ad hoc and reliant on the skills of subject artisans and workers.\nColumns and muqarnas appear in several chambers, and the interiors of numerous palaces are decorated with arabesques and calligraphy. The arabesques of the interior are ascribed to, among other sultans, Yusuf I, Mohammed V, and Ismail I, Sultan of Granada.\n\nAfter the Christian conquest of the city in 1492, the conquerors began to alter the Alhambra. The open work was filled up with whitewash, the painting and gilding effaced, and the furniture soiled, torn, or removed. Charles I (1516\u20131556) rebuilt portions in the Renaissance style of the period and destroyed the greater part of the winter palace to make room for a Renaissance-style structure which was never completed. Philip V (1700\u20131746) Italianised the rooms and completed his palace in the middle of what had been the Moorish building; he had partitions constructed which blocked up whole apartments.Over subsequent centuries the Moorish art was further damaged, and in 1812 some of the towers were destroyed by the French under Count Sebastiani. In 1821, an earthquake caused further damage. Restoration work was undertaken in 1828 by the architect Jos\u00e9 Contreras, endowed in 1830 by Ferdinand VII. After the death of Contreras in 1847, it was continued by his son Rafael (died 1890) and his grandson. Especially notable was the intervention of Leopoldo Torres Balb\u00e1s in the 1930s: the young architect \"opened arcades that had been walled up, re-excavated filled-in pools, replaced missing tiles, completed inscriptions that lacked portions of their stuccoed lettering, and installed a ceiling in the still unfinished palace of Charles V\".\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nAccording to the site's current architect, Pedro Salmeron Escobar, the Alhambra evolved organically over a period of several centuries from the ancient hilltop fortress defined by a narrow promontory carved by the river Darro and overlooking the Vega or Plain of Granada as it descends from the Sierra Nevada. The red earth from which the fortress is constructed is a granular aggregate held together by a medium of red clay which gives the resulting layered brick- and stone- reinforced construction (tapial calicastrado) its characteristic hue and is at the root of the name of 'the Red Hill'.This crude earthiness is counterpointed by the startling fine alabaster white stucco work of the famous interiors. Meltwater from the 'Snowy Mountains' is drawn across an arched vault at the eastern tip of the Torre del Agua ('Water Tower') and channeled through the citadel via a complex system of conduits (acequia) and water tanks (los albercones) which create the celebrated interplay of light, sound and surface.Alhambra is about 740 metres (2,430 ft) in length by 205 metres (670 ft) at its greatest width. It extends from west-northwest to east-southeast and covers an area of about 142,000 square metres (1,530,000 sq ft) or 35 acres. The Alhambra's most westerly feature is the Alcazaba (citadel), a strongly fortified position built to protect the original post-Roman districts of Iliberri, now 'Centro', and G\u00e1rnata al-yah\u016bd ('Granada of the Jews', now Realejo, and the Moorish suburb of El Albayz\u00edn.\n\nDue to touristic demand, modern access runs contrary to the original sequence which began from a principal access via the Puerta de la Justicia (Gate of Justice) onto a large souq or public market square facing the Alcazaba, now subdivided and obscured by later Christian-era development. From the Puerta del Vino (Wine Gate) ran the Calle Real (Royal Street) dividing the Alhambra along its axial spine into a southern residential quarter, with mosques, hamams (bathhouses) and diverse functional establishments, and a greater northern portion, occupied by several palaces of the nobility with extensive landscaped gardens commanding views over the Albayzin. All of this was subservient to the great Tower of the Ambassadors in the Palacio Comares, which acted as the royal audience chamber and throne room with its three arched windows dominating the city. The private, internalised universe of the Palacio de Los Leones (Palace of the Lions) adjoins the public spaces at right angles (see Plan illustration) but was originally connected only by the function of the Royal Baths, the Eye of Aixa's Room serving as the exquisitely decorated focus of meditation and authority overlooking the refined garden of Lindaraja/Daraxa toward the city.The rest of the plateau comprises a number of earlier and later Moorish palaces, enclosed by a fortified wall, with thirteen defensive towers, some such as the Torres de la Infanta and Cattiva containing elaborate vertical palaces in miniature. The river Darro passes through a ravine on the north and divides the plateau from the Albaic\u00edn district of Granada. Similarly, the Assabica Valley, containing the Alhambra Park, lies on the west and south, and, beyond this valley, the almost parallel ridge of Monte Mauror separates it from the Antequeruela district. Another ravine separates it from the Generalife, the summer pleasure gardens of the emir. Escobar notes that the later planting of deciduous elms obscures the overall perception of the layout, so a better reading of the original landscape is given in winter when the trees are bare.\n\n\n== Main structures ==\n\nThe Alhambra resembles many medieval Christian strongholds in its threefold arrangement as a castle, a palace and a residential annex for subordinates. The alcazaba or citadel, its oldest part, is built on the isolated and precipitous foreland which terminates the plateau on the northwest. All that remains are its massive outer walls, towers and ramparts. On its watchtower, the 25 m (85 ft) high Torre de la Vela, the flag of Ferdinand and Isabella was first raised as a symbol of the Spanish conquest of Granada on 2 January 1492. A turret containing a large bell was added in the 18th century and restored after being damaged by lightning in 1881. Beyond the Alcazaba is the palace of the Moorish rulers, The Nasrid Palaces or Alhambra proper, and beyond this is the Alhambra Alta (Upper Alhambra), originally occupied by officials and courtiers.\nAccess from the city to the Alhambra Park is afforded by the Puerta de las Granadas (Gate of Pomegranates), a triumphal arch dating from the 15th century. A steep ascent leads past the Pillar of Charles V, a fountain erected in 1554, to the main entrance of the Alhambra. This is the Puerta de la Justicia (Gate of Justice), a massive horseshoe archway surmounted by a square tower and used by the Moors as an informal court of justice. The hand of Fatima, with fingers outstretched as a talisman against the evil eye, is carved above this gate on the exterior; a key, the symbol of authority, occupies the corresponding place on the interior. A narrow passage leads inward to the Plaza de los Aljibes (Place of the Cisterns), a broad open space which divides the Alcazaba from the Moorish palace. To the left of the passage rises the Torre del Vino (Wine Tower), built in 1345 and used in the 16th century as a cellar. On the right is the palace of Charles V, a smaller Renaissance building, to construct which part of the Alhambra, including the original main entrance, was torn down.\n\n\n=== Royal complex ===\n\nThe Royal Complex (Plaza de Nazar\u00edes) consists of three main parts: Mexuar, Serallo, and the Harem. The Mexuar is modest in decor and houses the functional areas for conducting business and administration. Strapwork is used to decorate the surfaces in Mexuar. The ceilings, floors, and trim are made of dark wood and are in sharp contrast to white, plaster walls. Serallo, built during the reign of Yusuf I in the 14th century, contains the Patio de los Arrayanes (Court of the Myrtles). Brightly colored interiors featured dado panels, yeser\u00eda, azulejo, cedar, and artesonado. Artesonado are highly decorative ceilings and other woodwork. Lastly, the Harem is also elaborately decorated and contains the living quarters for the wives and mistresses of the Arab monarchs. This area contains a bathroom with running water (cold and hot), baths, and pressurized water for showering. The bathrooms were open to the elements in order to allow in light and air.\n\n\n=== Court of the Myrtles ===\n\nThe present entrance to the Palacio \u00c1rabe (Arab palace), or Casa Real, is by a small door from which a corridor connects to the Patio de los Arrayanes (Court of the Myrtles), also called the Patio de la Alberca (Court of the Blessing or Court of the Pond), from the Arabic birka, \"pool\". The birka helped to cool the palace and acted as a symbol of power. Because water was usually in short supply, the technology required to keep these pools full was expensive and difficult. This court is 42 m (140 ft) long by 22 m (74 ft) broad, and in the centre there is a large pond set in the marble pavement, full of goldfish, and with myrtles growing along its sides. There are galleries on the north and south sides; the southern gallery is 7 m (23 ft) high and supported by a marble colonnade. Underneath it, to the right, was the principal entrance, and over it are three windows with arches and miniature pillars. From this court, the walls of the Torre de Comares are seen rising over the roof to the north and reflected in the pond.\n\n\n=== Hall of the Ambassadors ===\n\nThe Sal\u00f3n de los Embajadores (Hall of the Ambassadors) is the largest room in the Alhambra and occupies all the Torre de Comares. It is a square room, the sides being 12 m (37 ft) in length, while the centre of the dome is 23 m (75 ft) high. This was the grand reception room, and the throne of the sultan was placed opposite the entrance. The grand hall projects from the walls of the palace, providing views in three directions. In this sense, it was a \"mirador\" from which the palace's inhabitants could gaze outward to the surrounding landscape.  The tiles are nearly 4 ft (1.2 m) high all round, and the colours vary at intervals. Over them is a series of oval medallions with inscriptions, interwoven with flowers and leaves. There are nine windows, three on each facade, and the ceiling is decorated with white, blue and gold inlays in the shape of circles, crowns and stars. The walls are covered with varied stucco works, surrounding many ancient escutcheons.\n\n\n=== Court of the Lions and fountain ===\n\nThe Court of the Lions (Patio de los Leones) is an oblong courtyard, 116 ft (35 m) in length by 66 ft (20 m) in width, surrounded by a low gallery supported on 124 white marble columns. A pavilion projects into the court at each extremity, with filigree walls and a light domed roof. The square is paved with coloured tiles and the colonnade with white marble, while the walls are covered 5 ft (1.5 m) up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles, with a border above and below of enamelled blue and gold. The columns supporting the roof and gallery are irregularly placed. They are adorned by varieties of foliage, etc.; about each arch there is a large square of stucco arabesques; and over the pillars is another stucco square of filigree work.\n\n\n==== Fountain of the Lions ====\nIn the centre of the court is the Fountain of the Lions, an alabaster basin supported by the figures of twelve lions in white marble, not designed with sculptural accuracy but as symbols of strength, power, and sovereignty. Each hour one lion would produce water from its mouth. At the edge of the great fountain there is a poem written by Ibn Zamrak. This praises the beauty of the fountain and the power of the lions, but it also describes their ingenious hydraulic systems and how they actually worked, which baffled all those who saw them.\n\n\n=== Hall of the Abencerrajes ===\n\nThe Sala de los Abencerrajes (Hall of the Abencerrages) derives its name from a legend according to which the father of Boabdil, the last sultan of Granada, having invited the chiefs of that line to a banquet, massacred them here. This room is a perfect square, with a lofty dome and trellised windows at its base. The roof is decorated in blue, brown, red and gold, and the columns supporting it spring out into the arch form in a remarkably beautiful manner. Opposite to this hall is the Sala de las dos Hermanas (Hall of the two Sisters), so-called from two white marble slabs laid as part of the pavement. These slabs measure 500 by 220 cm (15 by 7\u00bd ft). There is a fountain in the middle of this hall, and the roof \u2013 a dome honeycombed with tiny cells, all different, and said to number 5000 \u2013 is an example of the \"stalactite vaulting\" of the Moors.\n\n\n=== Generalife ===\n\nOf the outlying buildings connected to the Alhambra, the foremost in interest is the Palacio de Generalife or Gineralife (the Muslim Jennat al Arif, \"Garden of Arif,\" or \"Garden of the Architect\"). This villa dates from the beginning of the 14th century but has been restored several times. The Villa de los Martires (Martyrs' Villa), on the summit of Monte Mauror, commemorates by its name the Christian slaves who were forced to build the Alhambra and confined here in subterranean cells. The Torres Bermejas (Vermilion Towers), also on Monte Mauror, are a well-preserved Moorish fortification, with underground cisterns, stables, and accommodation for a garrison of 200 men. Several Roman tombs were discovered in 1829 and 1857 at the base of Monte Mauror.\n\n\n=== Other features ===\nAmong the other features of the Alhambra are the Sala de la Justicia (Hall of Justice), the Patio del Mexuar (Court of the Council Chamber), the Patio de Daraxa (Court of the Vestibule), and the Peinador de la Reina (Queen's Robing Room), in which there is similar architecture and decoration. The palace and the Upper Alhambra also contain baths, rows of bedrooms and summer-rooms, a whispering gallery and labyrinth, and vaulted sepulchres.\nThe original furniture of the palace is represented by one of the famous Alhambra vases, very large Hispano-Moresque ware vases made in the Sultanate to stand in niches around the palace. These famous examples of Hispano-Moresque ware date from the 14th and 15th centuries. The one remaining in the palace, from about 1400, is 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) high; the background is white and the decoration is blue, white and gold.\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\n\n=== In literature ===\n\nParts of the following works are set in the Alhambra:\n\nWashington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra. This is a collection of essays, verbal sketches, and stories. Irving lived in the palace while writing the book and was instrumental in introducing the site to Western audiences.\nSalman Rushdie's The Moor's Last Sigh\nAmin Maalouf's Leo Africanus, depicting the reconquest of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs.\nPhilippa Gregory's The Constant Princess, depicting Catalina the Infanta of Spain as she lived in the Alhambra after her parents took Granada.\nFederico Garc\u00eda Lorca's play Do\u00f1a Rosita the Spinster, mentioned by title character Do\u00f1a Rosita in her song/speech to the Manola sisters.\nPaulo Coelho's novel The Alchemist\nAli Smith's The Accidental\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's play Man and Superman\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai's Seiobo There Below\nHanya Yanagihara's A Little Life\n\n\n=== In music ===\nThe plot of the Ballet-h\u00e9ro\u00efque entitled Za\u00efde, Reine De Grenade, by the French Baroque composer Joseph-Nicolas-Pancrace Royer (c. 1705\u20131755), takes place at the Alhambra. Alhambra has directly inspired musical compositions as Francisco T\u00e1rrega's famous tremolo study for guitar Recuerdos De La Alhambra. Claude Debussy's piece for two pianos composed in 1901, Lindaraja, and the prelude, La Puerta Del Vino, from the second book of preludes composed from 1912 to 1913. Isaac Alb\u00e9niz wrote a piano suite Recuerdos De viaje, which included a piece called \"En La Alhambra\", while his suite Iberia contained a piece called \"El Albacin\". Alb\u00e9niz also composed an uncompleted Suite Alhambra.\n\n\"En Los Jardines Del Generalife\", the first movement of Manuel de Falla's Noches En Los Jardines De Espa\u00f1a, and other pieces by composers such as Ruperto Chap\u00ed (Los Gnomos De La Alhambra, 1891), Tom\u00e1s Bret\u00f3n, and many others are included in a stream referred to by scholars as Alhambrismo.In 1976, filmmaker Christopher Nupen filmed The Song of the Guitar at the Alhambra which was an hour-long program featuring the legendary Spanish guitarist, Andr\u00e9s Segovia.\nBritish composer Peter Seabourne wrote an extended piano cycle Steps Volume 3: Arabesques (2008-2012) based on shared experiences of the Alhambra with his painter aunt Ann Seabourne, and a movement from his Steps Volume 1 is entitled \"El Suspiro del Moro\" inspired by the legend of the expulsion of the last Moorish King of Granada. Julian Anderson wrote an orchestral piece, Alhambra Fantasy.\nIn pop and folk music, Alhambra is the subject of the Ghymes song of the same name. The rock band Grateful Dead released a song called \"Terrapin Station\" on the 1977 album of the same name. It consisted of a series of small compositions penned by Robert Hunter and put to music by Jerry Garcia; a lyrical section of this suite was called \"Alhambra\". In September 2006, Canadian singer/composer Loreena McKennitt performed live at the Alhambra. The resulting video recordings premiered on PBS and were later released as a 3-disc DVD/CD set called Nights from the Alhambra. The Basque pop group Mocedades performed a song called \"Juntos En La Alhambra\". Alhambra is the title of an EP recording by Canadian rock band, The Tea Party, containing acoustic versions of a few of their songs. Alhambra and Albaic\u00edn are mentioned in the M\u00e4go de Oz song named \"El Paseo De Los Tristes\" from the album entitled Gaia II. On California rapper Dom Kennedy's 2015 album By Dom Kennedy, there is a song entitled \"Alhambra\".\n\n\n=== In mathematics ===\n\nThe Alhambra tiles are remarkable in that they contain nearly all, if not all, of the seventeen mathematically possible wallpaper groups. This is a unique accomplishment in world architecture. M. C. Escher's visit in 1922 and study of the Moorish use of symmetries in the Alhambra tiles inspired his subsequent work on tessellation, which he called \"regular divisions of the plane\".\n\n\n=== In film ===\nMarcel L'Herbier's 1921 film El Dorado features many scenes shot in and around the Alhambra palace. This was the first time permission had been granted for a feature film company to shoot inside the Alhambra palace and L'Herbier gave prominent place to its gardens, fountains and geometric architectural patterns, which became some of the film's most memorable images.\nAnimated films by Spanish director Juan Bautista Berasategui such as Ahmed, El Principe De La Alhambra and El Embrujo Del Sur are based on stories in Washington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra.\nColumbus interview with Queen Isabella in Conquest of Paradise representing Granada after the Reconquest were filmed at Alhambra. As well as the Palace Scenes of Kingdom of Heaven representing Jerusalem during the Cruzades. Both films were made by Ridley Scott.\nThe Court of the Lions was depicted in Assassin's Creed (2016) when Sultan Muhammad XII surrenders the 'Apple of Eden', a powerful artifact in the center of the movie plot, in exchange for his son's safe return. Both the Court of the Lions and Granada's Albaicin are featured on The animated film Tad Jones: The Hero Returns.The fictional Broadway theatre (the interior actually Auckland, New Zealand's Civic Theatre), in which Kong is displayed as the 'Eighth Wonder of the World' in 2005's King Kong, is named \"The Alhambra\".2018 South Korean television series Memories of the Alhambra is based in Granada, Spain. The CEO of an investment company that specializes in optical devices, travels to Granada, Spain to meet the creator of the game. He gets entangled in a mysterious incident, and the border between the real world and the AR world begins to blur.\n\n\n=== In board games ===\nDirk Henn's game Der Palast von Alhambra, literally \"The Palace of the Alhambra\".

          "The Alhambra is the reason why I go to Spain. At the Alhambra, I could see the Islamic culture to my heart's content. The view from the Alhambra was so cool! The weather in Granada was fantastic. I felt sweet and romantic. I walked for about 2 hours with my family. It was a",
          "One of the best sites I've visited in my life. Amazing mix of Arab and Christian architecture. Pictures cannot describe exactly the vibes of Alhambra.",
          "Pictures do not do it justice! Having a great guide, you get to learn the history of Grenada and Alhambra. My favorite was about the showers and why there are orange trees everywhere. It really is an incredibly beautiful place. The architecture and landscape are breathtaking!",
          "We shouldn't have visited the Alhambra. The first sign came when we found out that my husband had bought tickets for the wrong date. I went on the website, and checked that there was availability for the correct date (several tickets available, in fact). As we do not speak",
          "The Alhambra is one of the sights one must visit in their lifetime. It is an amazing place. The fort, the palaces, the gardens, the architecture, everything is so wonderful! Within the whole complex of buildings there are countless rooms, patios, fountains, gardens, baths,",
          "If this isn't on your bucket list, add it. They manage the crowds well. Very large site, so be prepared to walk, incl. 10-minute walk from front gate to tour entry point. Don't miss Nasrid Palace!",

          "There is a reason why, even in January, you must make a reservation to enter this attraction. Overwhelming!! Beautiful!! Interesting history. We spent 5 hours- and it still was not enough to capture everything. Special shout out to the staff that keep the bathroom super",
          "No review is adequate to describe what is one of the most outstanding sites in the world. Beyond description really. So, all I can really offer are tips on how to experience the Alhambra. First, buy your timed tickets for the Nasrid prior to your visit. Enter at the Justice",

          "We were told to wear comfortable shoes for this tour and you really need to. The size is amazing. I would definitely recommend having a tour guide to take you through as I can't imagine you'd get much from it but some pretty views without a guide to provide the history, etc.",
          "I reserved the Nasrid Palace at 12:00. So I arrived at 10:30am. And take a look Generalife first. I spent my time without being hurry and I think 90 min is enough. Also there were not that many people at the time so I could enjoy this beautiful palace peacefully.",

          "We went with a 'small' group tour (that still felt quite large) but learned much more about this place than had we gone on our own. It's very crowded, but our guide steered us one way or the other depending on where different groups were headed. There's a lot of history here,",
          "This is a must see for anyone visiting Granada. They limit ticket sales each day so you must buy in advance. We booked a guided tour that included the tickets. The tour provided great information and history. We were able to walk around after the tour and visit to onsite",

          "I stupidly bought a Viator tour of the Alhambra but too late realised it did not include the Nazrid palace which is the best bit. Unbelievable to charge 39 euros pp when a regular entry ticket to the whole complex cost 9 euros (seniors but still much cheaper). We tried to go",

          "Wow, wow, wow. It's an amazing site to visit. We took the audio guide which is well worth the 6 euro cost per person, so much info provide and you can stop listening when you wish. We're not usually slow visitors but we were here for over 4 hours. We arrived at 8:30, had",

          "Loved our visit. Highly recommended. The audio/video guide at 6 euros is also highly recommended. Lastly, I recommend getting an Uber up the hill to the site and back to your hotel as you will be doing a lot of walking while in that site. Loved my visit. Leave 4 hours aside to",

          "Definitely a palace to visit, good value for money and worth the hassle of the cumbersome ticket purchase process. In the UK I looked at the official website to buy tickets and found that tickets for the 4 weeks of late Feb/March were sold out. Once in Spain, I looked again and",

It was just gorgeous to walk through the gardens and grounds (which you can do in part for free) but it\u2019s certainly well worth the ticket (around $50 AUD",
          "Having waited years to visit The Alhambra, especially for a history boff like me, was an absolute treat. The magnificent palace is a testament of a unique era in Granada\u2019s history when the Moors put their stamp on the landscape. Fabulous palaces, gorgeous gardens, breathtaking",
          "If you are in Andalusia, do go and visit this ancient site. The highlights are the Nasrid Palaces - built during the middle of the 13th Century and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984 the beauty of this place remains remarkably intact. You will need to book tickets",
          "This shouId be on your \"must-do\" list for Spain. We had a guided tour which greatly enhances the visit. The garden and grounds are lovely, and there are great views of the palace from the garden. Much of the intricate, detailed plaster work of the walls is still in great shape.",
          "If you want to feel transported to a different place in time, the Alhambra is a must! The magic and feeling of this place is special. Forget instagram able photos and live the place. Don\u2019t forget to buy tickets in advance. This is mandatory.",
          "The Alhambra is everything one would expect and more! Took a tour with Marina from Granavision and it was amazing. The ticket process and getting to the Alhambra is not necessarily easy...thus we booked a tour (picked up in Sevilla) and were quite thankful. We learned so much",
          "There is much to see throughout this extraordinary attraction so stroll leisurely to get the most quality for your visit.",
          "A castle with almost unlimited varities in itrinsic architecural marvels, a joy to photograph, an immense pleasure to walk through the beautiful rooms and open areas. See this and Generalife in one experience.",

          "So this was my redemption trip. Came here 15 years ago with out pre-purchasing tickets and were denied. We were lucky on this trip since i ended up snatching up the last four tickets in the window we were there. What a magnificent place! If you plan on visiting, make sure",
          "Beautiful place and architecture. We took a trip with the cruise ship since no other company had them available. Be prepare to walk but it is so worth it.",
          "We enjoyed our visit. It's busy, but we'll organized. We were impressed by the three museums on the grounds too. The palace was impressive, however having recently been in Morroco we were less impressed than those around us. But thinking of the she of this work and the",
          "We visited the Alhambra palace while in Granada. My wife had visited before but this was my first visit. We stayed all day as there was lots to look at. As my Grandson says it was epic.",
          "We used headout skip the line tours and had an amazing experience. It is why you go to Granada; the city was once very important 1400\u2019s. Now it us a tourist / college town. Beautiful",
          "Fantastic site, a must visit for Granada - and allow most of the day for it. Would recommend getting the audio guide, which has all the main sections in order so ensures you don't miss anything as the site is massive. Entry to the Nasrid Palace is timed, so make sure you don't",
          "We had a tour around and it\u2019s history is very interesting. It is a very beautiful place and would really recommend! Especially if you like walks.",

          "I was initially ticked off that I couldn't buy tickets for individual independent visits (unless I wanted to wait two months) and had to buy 39\u20ac guided tour tickets. (Twenty years ago, during Holy Week, I was able to buy an independent visit ticket the day I arrived.) The guided",
          "Absolutely beautiful....so much history, lovely grounds....architecture is absolutely amazing! A must see!",
          "If you are coming here (which you really should) be sure to book tickets ahead of time. Entry is timed and you really do need to get there at least half an hour before your entry time since you have to get from the parking lot down to the entry point which is about a 10 minute",
          "We booked a small group tour and our tour guide was excellent. He took us on a journey with warmth and humour and kept to time in a relaxed way. He has extensive historical knowledge which he shared in a balanced way. I thought the price was a lot at first but after the tour",
          "Interesting to see on guided tour which can be booked online. Long walk and takes over three hours. Wear comfortable shoes",
          "Very nice just like everything else at Alhambra. Lovely architecture but also loads of tourists. Well worth your visit!",
          "At present the Alhambra is under reforms in certain rooms and areas. I strongly suggest to take your tickets in advance through the online booking site and to join a guided tour in your native language, to fully enjoy the visit. The guide will also suggest angles and hidden",
          "If you came all the way down to Granada, the iconic \"La Alhambra\" is probably the main focus of your journey to this beautiful city. So much has been already written about the fortresses and palaces, that I'll only say the basic: 1) book your \"full\" ticket (including the Nasrid",
          "A really worthwhile experience. Very interesting. We booked ahead with a guided tour by NHUE (see separate review) which was superb and avoided queues. Well worth the cost for best experience. We parked in the 24 hour car parks 1, 2, 3 and 4. You walk downhill to meet the guide",
          "The Alhambra is the highlight of our visit to Granada. We booked our tickets online, a few months prior to our arrival. I would recommend booking early as I have had friends who left it late and then were unable to book any tickets. I found a tour guide very good, informative",
          "Sadly damaged during the Napoleonic wars and later ,but now meticulously restored. Together with Cordoba it gives a valuable insight into north Arab settlements in Spain and its impact on Spain. We visited the site in January which had the advantage of less crowds, but is was",
          "Loved our visit hear ... we was told that we couldn\u2019t get tickets tried before we went but was no availability ... when we got there we was told to go online the night before we wanted to go has to be 12am and there was lots of availability for the next day but apparently they",
          "A very popular and historic site. The exterior is not impressive but the interior is absolutely lush with decorations, views, pools of water, fountains, greenery and so much history. We had a guided tour and I would recommend a guide. It is pointless taking photos in the",
          "Carmen was fantastic. She was very knowledgeable and gave us a great insight into the Alhambra and Generalife. Well worth it for such a wonderful historic site.",
          "Booked a \"skip the line Alhambra tour\" on May 18,2019 by Viator. Tour was confirmed by Viator. We took a side trip to visit this landmark. We got to the Alhambra for the tour and find out after multiple calls that there was no tour! Great!! Took a bus,stayed overnight and did",
          "Finding the entrance was complicated but eventually we figured it out after climbing up the steep road. I don\u2019t know how I did it but I did. After catching my breath we then purchased the headphones to hear about the history. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart but definitely worth",
          "I shouldn't think anyone visits Granada without visiting The Alhambra. It is simply A Must. Stunning architecture and Gardens . I would recommend paying for a guide as there is simply so much to see and take in that you need someone to explain it all as you go. Pretty exhausting",
          "Well worth booking the tour - 8am-1pm and we learnt so much. Consuela was a fantastic guide with English and Spanish. Full of good tips for the city too.",
          "Even in January there were many visitors, as you might imagine, so that distracts a bit from the experience, but overall, I am so glad I visited this place. I chose to walk from down below in Granada and it was quite the uphill hike and early in the morning, there were very few",
          "A must see attraction and most famous in South spain. Although it was off season, it is 100% booked. I tried to book more than a week earlier but no slot left. Had to pay 40\u20ac insisted of 14\u20ac regular price. Long queue at check-in as only one person is checking the tickets.",
          "This was one of the best trips I had taken with my husband and daughter. Pictures didnt do it justice and the amazing Islamic history of the Nasrid palace will mesmerize you. Give yourself time to explore each section of Alhambra but keep in mind that once you explore one",
          "I have visited a few places like this before, but none of them were as large and impressive as the Alhambra, with Castles, Alcazaba, Generalife, Walls, Gardens, etc. Beautiful place, and worth every penny for the visit. Do pay for the top ticket in order to visit the Nasrid",
          "Great historical site amizing gardens. would probably be better to go early morning or late afternoon to avoid crowds and the midday heat. highly advised to pre book your tickets.",
          "Palace and gardens are in a good shape. But I wouldn't call it fantastic, especially if you don't go deep into historical background. Many people compare it with Sevilla Alcazar. My opinion is that they both worth to visit, I still cannot design what is more impressive.",
          "WoW Alhambra over 500 years old still shining like a star it shows the power and joy and work of art culture So beautiful is like haven on the earth just imagine when it\u2019s built,the beauty of this pearl I have no words come on see I seen it twice I wish I could see it every day",
          "Fabulous place to visit, go as early as you can as it gets busy and hot. Spend as much time as you can in the Nazrin palaces, they are breathtaking",
          "I\u2019ve been wanting to visit the Alhambra since college, so I was over the moon to finally get the opportunity to do so. It was gorgeous and rich with history. I loved being able to wander throughout the grounds, and finding myself alone (despite the crowd) to enjoy its",
          "My wife and I spent four hours at Alhambra. Tiring but well worth it. Great deals by paying only for entry and then getting earphones. Guides are expensive.",
          "We arrived in Granada in July and thought we could just select any day we wanted and go see the Alhambra. We were told by the hotel that usually people book the site 3 months in advance, so we'd have little chance of seeing it---- unless----we went online on the Alhambra site",
          "I tried to find them at the Meetup location which it turns out is just a random spot rather than an actual organisation but couldn\u2019t find them and then tried to find a number to call them on which (a) was not obvious to find at all in the paperwork as it\u2019s not actually in the",
          "Recently visited Alhambra in Spain although it was quite nice , don\u2019t think I would rush back . Cost to go in and extortionate parking , and when we payed at the machine it short changed us by 2 euros there was a man in the box next to machine , we told him it had short changed",
          "My dear, you must see the Alhambra Castle. It's beautiful. The complex consists of three buildings: the main palace, summer palace and defensive walls (alcazaba). If you are sure that you want to see the Alhambra castle you should make a reservation online.",
          "Must see in Granada and Andalusia, which is worth visiting just to see the Alhambra. Buy your ticket in advance online to avoid cues and secure the visit to Nasrid Palaces.",
          "My wife booked the trip and I have to say I was not sure about going. How wrong was I! This place is amazing. Each palace has its own charm and character and are beautifully preserved and kept. We booked a guided tour and chose a small group which consisted of 12 people so was",
          "Having visited the Alcazar in Seville I was unsure whether the Alhambra was going to be all it was cracked up to be but...... WOW, amazing, and just perfect. The only thing I thought was not quite right was the marble slabs put down as flooring in the Court of Lions. It did",
          "We visited the Alhambra on a beautiful day at the end of January. These comments are on accessibility. We found driving there from Nerja to be easy - very good road and about 1 hour 20 minutes. We drove into car park 5 - mistake. No one there to ask way. Went on to cemetery -",
          "Breathing-taking! So much to see, all wonderful. Be sure to get tickets in advance. A \u201cmust see\u201d in Spain.",
          "We had to do the tour of the palace when we went back to Granada. We had visited quite a few years before and of course it was every bit as good this time. So much to see it is absolutely marvellous. Got to book your tickets in advance.",
          "The Nasrid Palace was a must. For some reason I couldn\u2019t access my pictures of the Palace. Most of the pictures here were from the Generalife area. There were also 2 museums.",
          "This has been on my bucket list for some time and a 4 day stay in Seville made it possible. We booked a day trip with guided tours while in Seville. The Alhambra is unique and cannot be compared with any other historic site. The guides are well- informed and their English is",
          "Because other reviews have covered the site\u2019s world designation status, the architecture and history, etc., let me just add - this is a must see. It is something you do NOT want to miss, and I would allow the entire day to see it completely, and at an enjoyable pace. Buying",

          "Since we knew we wanted to see everything, we split our visit into 2 parts. The evening self-guided tour of the interior was a really enjoyable way to spend an evening in Granada. Its Spain too everything can be super late. Next morning was the outside grounds. We got some",

          "The Alhambra has been on my bucket list since I was too young to even think of one. It\u2019s taken 50 years to get here, but the reality truly exceeded all expectation. The magnitude, the proportion, the exquisite detail go beyond description, even photography. A word of caution,",
          "Always wanted to come here and now I finally got to see it. It is a wonderful place and different than anything you have ever seen. The different layers of dynasties are just wonderfull. We were early so it wasn\u2019t that crowded but there are a lot of people :-)",
          "Absolutely stunning, surpassed Instanbul's Aya Sophia and The Blue Mosque. We didn't book in advance because it was a last minute trip, and sure enough it showed 'sold out' online for days ahead BUT the Alhambra website quietly releases tickets for the next day at midnight the",
          "It is ridiculous to try to offer a review of this place. Absolutely breathtaking and fascinating. We took the full tour but did not bother with audio guides or an official guide. Might have been worth having a guide or at least a good guidebook (although we did read up on it",

          "We mentioned to our hotel receptionist in Granada that we missed out on getting tickets to The Alhambra and she said that we could try the option to stay up until midnight and buy any spare tickets they had for that following day. We thought she was joking but we had the website",
          "The Alhambra is definitely a MUST to do in the city, not only for the greatness of it\u2019s buildings but also for the history behind it. Is incredibly well maintained, the palaces of Nazar\u00edes is also incredibly maintained and full of great things to see.",
          "Having only just managed to book tickets before they sold out a few months before our trip, we were then worried about getting in (we didn\u2019t print our tickets), the size of the queue, and other annoyances flagged in various articles, blogs, and reviews. We needn\u2019t have worried,",

          "Ditto to all the positive comments, we spent a very leisurely day here enjoying lunch at the parador. The gardens are beautiful and much better kept than the ones at the Alcazar in Seville. Ensure you take your ID with you (the one you used to buy the tickets with) because at",

          "We took a 3 hour tour and was definitely worth doing. I originally thought 3 hours would be too long but it ended up feeling too short. We would definitely recommend this tour.",
          "We had a perfect day at the Alhambra. We couldn\u2019t get a guided tour but I bought a helpful book and we saw everything as well as enjoying the Generalife gardens. Tranquil and inspiring.",
          "We did one of our very few led tours and we are so glad we did. Our guide (can\u2019t remember her name) was so enthusiastic and knowledgeable throughout the whole 3.5 hour tour. So much to see and so much history to learn about.",
          "Fantastic experience, we arrived in Granada after a trip from Antequerra, in a thunder and lightning storm, however, it was worth the trip, the Alahambra was one of the most amazing places I have ever seen, the Versailles of Spain, but even more stunning, We had a great guide",
          "Wonderful historic place with buildings and gardens. Huge so please make sure you have time to cover it all. Allow for at least three hours.",
          "We didn\u2019t realize tickets sold out 1 1/2 months ahead of time. We went to the gate the day before and they said to log in at midnight and they release extra or cancelled tickets at that time. We ahead of time pretended we were buying a ticket 2 months ahead so we knew exactly",
          "Amazing must see place. We spent more than half a day to see it. The audio guide was wonderful. Must buy your tickets well in advance, or like we did,stay up til midnight and hope to get tickets on the website for the next day as they released extra tickets nightly at midnight.",
          "I was on the head out tour, the guide is great, and the palace and view is breathtaking, well worth the travel time from Madrid. The garden is beautiful , highly recommended.",
          "This is the highlight of my trip to Spain this year. It is probably the most beautiful palace I have ever seen. Yes, Alcazar in Sevilla is similar but no comparison to this. It is hard to get tickets. You need to j you need to enter the Nassrid palace. Make sure you stick to the",
          "I loved every minute of the visit. I do recommended joining a guided tour because our visit was much more in-depth due to the guide.",
          "One of the great sites to visit in the world. Be sure to view it with a professional guide. I was lucky enough to gave Alberto who is a third generation guide with39 years of experience. Of course one needs to reserve a slot well in advance. Reserve 3 hours for the tour",
          "Not a short trip but should not be missed. Stunning inside as well as the perfectly kept grounds. The moorish castle that was expanded over the centuries is an architectural marvel. Lots of walking. Lots of stairs. Not handicap compatible.",
          "The last and arguably most significant example of moorish architecture before they were expelled in 1495 (+/-). You haven't seen Spain if you haven't visited Alhambra.",
          "My wife and I traveled southern Spain in the middle of September [2019] and visited the Alahambra. This is truly one of the great Wonders of the World. The property is HUGE. With its various cultural influences over the centuries, it was mind blowing to this couple from",
          "Take no other advice, but book Online and in advance! This place gets booked up months and months in advance, with limited daily ticket allocation and bookings often over 6months in advance. Do not leave it to chance, as you will be disappointed.",
          "Amazing Place. We went with a quide and it was well worth it. Make sure to book your tickets well in advance.",
          "If youre lucky enough to have got tickets to the palace...Well done... Our visit was on the 12th October and tickets for the entire month had gone by the end of September. We ended up with a tour of the grands and associated fortifications and it was well worth it. We were",

          "This is a very big place...great views and lots to see. We had a very knowledgeable guide who made the experience even better...you could probably do it on your own cheaper but it is much more enjoyable with a great guide. We went in late September, so crowds were less but still",
          "Jos\u00e9 Francisco was our guide from SixThrills and he was outstanding. Knowledgeable, professional, friendly and very patient with questions, Jos\u00e9 was very accommodating to everyone\u2019s needs\u2014both young and old. SixThrills is a well-run, welcoming, first-rate travel company\u2014highly",

          "We managed to get last minute tickets online for \u20ac14 each rather than booking an expensive tour. Note that the timed entrance is to the Nasrid Palace not the complex. We had to rush all the way to the palace in time for entry. Take the audio guide. It\u2019s worthwhile. Beware",
          "We drove to the Alhambra from Nerja which was an easy hour\u2019s drive up the motorway. We arrived at 9.30 and car park 1 was already full. I had bought a senior concession ticket for my husband so we had to go to the ticket office to verify this. This was no problem there wasn\u2019t a",

          "There are so many beautiful places to see here. It is one of the most expensive tourist tings to see in Spain, but very much worth it. Bring water and a good packed lunch, because it will take you all day to see this wonderful place with so many gardens and beautiful buildings",
          "My younger son said that is annoying because is lots of walking but I would disagree. It is very interesting and unique place with influence of different cultures and times. If you would like to visit this place you need to buy your tickets weeks before unless you happy to spend",
          "This experience needs at least 4-5 hours so be prepared. Fantastic experience and exposure to what feels like another world. The \"city\" is at the top of Granada so recommend taking a bus or taxi up and walking down. The walk is beautiful but with all of the walking you will",
          "Wonderful to experience the 13th wonder of the world in October when the weather is still beautiful but not too oppressive - but don't think that means you don't need to book in advance to see the Nasrid Palace. We came across a lot of disappointed people.",
          "Well worth a visit. Simply stunning and great value at \u20ac20 including an audio tour. A must see whilst in Granada",
          "This is a must if you go to Granada. I will not go into details about how amazing this place is but to share some tips of how to get there. I did not do my homework until 2 weeks before my departure and to my shock and horror you have to book the tickets through internet in",
          "Palace is amazing and worth the visit but make sure that you visit it during the day. Access to many of the areas is restricted but I guess it's still an amazing experience. Even though I have seen a lot of spectacular and magnificent palaces in India, I was still very impressed",
          "The Alhambra and Generalife (garden) are expansive. The most important thing is to book a reservation to see the Nasrid Palace. One of the best way to do this is to buy a Granada card. The card allows entrance to other attractions and bus ride (recommended if you don't want to",
          "No amount of words or pictures can describe how incredible this place. The artistry and detail found in every corner of this palace complex is beyond what you could even imagine. There is truly nothing else like this on earth. A couple of items to keep in mind: Book tickets in",
          "Not this time for us to visit the Alhambra but another time when holidays can be planned 6 months in advance. Impossible for me. We walked around the free area and got some perspectives.",
          "We had a fantastic guide who made the whole trip amazing from start to finish it is definitely at must to see",
          "The Alhambra is beautiful. Definitely carve out a few hours to check this out. It is on top of a massive hill, so you will probably want to get dropped off!",
          "You cannot miss this if you are in this area. All parts of it were amazing. Just a tip , book way ahead as they are always booked. Also get the multiple ticket which includes the Granada Pass that lets I ro all the sites as well as other monuments in Granada as well as a bus",
          "Is it naiv to arrive at the ticket counter at midday thinking to get a ticket for the same day? Apparently, get your ticket way in advance. We made the trip from Malaga to Grenada for nothing.",
          "We only spent one night here and did a 3 hour tour with our private guide. It was not to be missed but for us, I cannot imagine seeing it without a private guide for the 4 of us. Crowded",
          "Jose Francisco with Six Thrills was a fantastic guide for our 3 hour plus tour. We had a great day in Granada!",
          "Not to be missed but a pain to organize. We bought tickets online for the palace 3 months in advance on the day they became available. Even then it said only 16 spots left for 10.30. Overseas credit card worked fine on their new site. Ignore old comments. We walked up at 8.30,",
          "The Alhambra is a must see at least once in a life-time. You will remember the beauty of the architecture and magical surrounding mountains for the rest of your life. I've visited several times and the most recent was in October 2019. My first visit was in May of 1981 and",

          "This is why people visit Granada!! Fabulous. Remember to prebook you visit to ensure entry, this place gets booked up. Only so many people are allowed in at a time, which makes the whole experience better. If you are a senior citizen or a student you qualify for discounts,",
          "Heaving with people but an amazing place which must be seen to be truly appreciated! Beautiful architecture stunning gardens and the tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and entertaining. We booked an independent guide which was well worth the money though pretty tiring after",
          "I wanted to come here after reading a book about Katherine of Aragon. Isabel and Ferdinand\u2019s daughter and Henry VIII\u2019s first wife. We had a private guide and that made all the difference. It is crowded and lots of big tour groups. Our guide asked several people to stop",

          "This was a bucket list thing. Absolutely wonderful, so much history, so much beauty. We booked a guided tour, there were about 15 in our group many other groups were larger and some as small as a party of four. We had not realised that to book tickets in advance meant at least",
          "Best thing about our visit to Granada. We booked online a guided tour, including the palace. I\u2019d highly recommend it. Pre-booking is a must & make sure that the palace tour is included.",
          "This is not the only reason to visit Granada, but it cannot be missed. Despite all the hype, you can book online for less than a week ahead. Night visit is cheap but very little to see. Daytime visits are excellent, but you pay to see the interiors of the palaces.",

        "wiki": "Granada Cathedral, or the Cathedral of the Incarnation (Spanish: Catedral de Granada, Santa Iglesia Catedral Metropolitana de la Encarnaci\u00f3n de Granada) is a Roman Catholic church in the city of Granada, capital of the province of the same name in the Autonomous Region of Andalusia, Spain. The cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Granada.\n\n\n== History ==\n  \n  \nUnlike most cathedrals in Spain, construction was not begun until the sixteenth century in 1518 in the centre of the old Muslim Medina, after acquisition of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada from its Muslim rulers in 1492. While its earliest plans had Gothic designs, such as are evident in the Royal Chapel of Granada by Enrique Egas, most of the church's construction occurred when the Spanish Renaissance style was supplanting the Gothic in Spanish architecture. Foundations for the church were laid by the Enrique Egas starting from 1518 to 1523 atop the site of the city's main mosque; by 1529, Egas was replaced by Diego de Silo\u00e9 who worked for nearly four decades on the structure from ground to cornice, planning the triforium and five naves instead of the usual three. Most unusually, he created a circular capilla mayor (principal chapel) rather than a semicircular apse, perhaps inspired by Italian ideas for circular 'perfect buildings' (e.g., in Alberti's works). Within its structure the cathedral combines other of the Vitruvian orders of architecture.\nSubsequent architects included Juan de Maena (1563\u20131571), followed by Juan de Orea (1571\u20131590), and Ambrosio de Vico (1590\u2013?). In 1667 Alonso Cano, working with Gaspar de la Pe\u00f1a, altered the initial plan for the main fa\u00e7ade, introducing Baroque elements. The cathedral took 181 years to build. It would have been even grander had the two 81-meter towers included in the plans been built; however, the project remained incomplete for various reasons, among them financial.\nThe Cathedral had been intended as the royal mausoleum by Charles I of Spain, but Philip II of Spain moved the site for his father's and subsequent kings' tombs to El Escorial outside of Madrid.\nThe main chapel contains two kneeling effigies of the Catholic King and Queen, Isabel and Ferdinand by Pedro de Mena y Medrano. The busts of Adam and Eve were made by Alonso Cano. The Chapel of the Trinity has a marvelous retablo with paintings by El Greco, Jusepe de Ribera and Alonso Cano.\n\n\n== Features ==\nGranada's cathedral has a rectangular base due to its five naves that completely cover the cross.. All of the five naves are staggered in height, the central one being the largest. At the foot of the cathedral there are two towers. The left one, called the tower of San Miguel, acts as a buttress which replaced the planned tower on that side.\nThe main chapel consists of a series of Corinthian columns on which capitals is the entablature and, over it, the vault, which houses a series of delicate stained glass windows.\nThe facade consists of a framed structure in the form of a triumphal arch with portals and canvas. It consists of three pillars crowned by semicircular arches supported on pilasters, similar to San Andr\u00e9s de Mantua of Leon Battista Alberti. The pilasters don't have capitals but projections sculptured in the walls, as well as attached marble medallions. Above the main door is located a marble tondo from \"Jos\u00e9 Laughing on the Annunciation\". Additionally, there is a vase with lilies at the top, alluding to the virgin and pure nature of the mother of God.\nThe sacrarium, raised between 1706 and 1759, follows the classic proportions of the whole, keeping the multiple columns of the transept the shapes of the compound of Siloam.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite of Granada Cathedral with relevant information\nGuide to monuments of Granada: the Cathedral (in Spanish)\nInformation about Granada Cathedral on a website devoted monuments of Granada, Spain\nDel arte \u00e1rabe en Espa\u00f1a A nook By Rafael Contreras y Mu\u00f1oz dealing with Arabs and Spanish art and architecture, pages 1\u20137.\nInformation on the Cathedrals of Granada on the Spain.info website.\nHistory of the monuments of Granada in English\nDetailed maps of Granada\nInformation on the Cathedrals of Granada on a Nicaraguan website\nGuide to Granada Cathedral and the city of Granada",

          "Gorgeous, get a guided tour. Well worth it.",

          "Breath taking architecture experience who shouldn't be missed",
          "This is a pretty spectacular building and worth the \u20ac5 admission.  If you want to visit several of the religious buildings in Granada, they have a combination ticket available, but you must buy it from the gift shop across from the \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Palacio de Generalife (Spanish pronunciation: [xe.ne.\u027ea.\u02c8li.fe]; Arabic: \u062c\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0641\u200e Jannat al-\u2018Ar\u012bf, literally, \"Architect's Garden\") was the summer palace and country estate of the Nasrid rulers of the Emirate of Granada in Al-Andalus, now beside the city of Granada in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe palace and gardens were built during the reign of Muhammed II (1273-1302), Sultan of Granada, and later by Muhammed III (1302\u20131309). They were redecorated shortly after by Abu I-Walid Isma'il (1313\u20131324). Much of the garden is a recent reconstruction of dubious authenticity. Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, a mid-19th century visitor, complained that:  Of the Generalife nothing now remains but some arcades and some large panels of arabesques, unfortunately plastered over with layers of whitewash that have been applied again and again with all the obstinacy of a dispiriting cleanliness. Little by little the delicate sculptures and the marvellous guilloches of this fairy-like architecture have been obliterated, filled up, and engulfed. What is at present nothing more than a faintly-vermiculated wall, was formerly open lace-work as fine as those ivory leaves which the patience of the Chinese carves for fans.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe complex consists of the Patio de la Acequia (Court of the Water Channel or Water-Garden Courtyard), which has a long pool framed by flowerbeds, fountains, colonnades and pavilions, and the Jard\u00edm de la Sultana (Sultana's Garden or Courtyard of the Cypress). The former is thought to best preserve the style of the medieval Persian garden in Al-Andalus.\nOriginally the palace was linked to the Alhambra by a covered walkway across the ravine that now divides them. The Generalife is one of the oldest surviving Moorish gardens.\n\n\n== 20th century ==\nThe present-day gardens were started in 1931 and completed by Francisco Prieto Moreno in 1951. The walkways are paved in traditional Granadian style with a mosaic of pebbles: white ones from the River Darro and black ones from the River Genil.The Generalife is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Granada, along with the Alhambra palace and gardens, and the Albayz\u00edn district.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThere is an imitation of part of the Generalife at Roundhay Park in Leeds, UK.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPalacio de Galiana\nSpanish gardens\nAlhambra\nGranada\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlhambra and Generalife Official Site\nAlhambra, Generalife and Albayz\u00edn, Granada\nMuseum With No Frontiers [1]\nBBC Picture Gallery\nGeneralife plan\nAlhambra and Generalife information",

          "As with Alhambra well worth the visit for those in Granada. There is a lot to take in so I suggest a guide",
          "A really beautiful sight, definitely worth the detour when you are visiting the Alhambra! Would highly recommend!",
          "BUT absolutely still worth a visit. Especially if you love gardens. Try for the late afternoon - less people and a bit more casual.",
          "Do not take a taxi to Alhambra around 9:00am-10:00am. We stuck in a huge traffic jam while going there and we pay a lot of for the ride :( My friends had also this issue.",
          "Well manicured and expansive garden of the palace. Get the audio guide to make the trip worth the while. Buy online way ahead to secure an entrance ticket.",
          "I really liked this garden and would like to see it functioning as a garden with herbs and fruit for sale, would be a great agricultural experience. Although you aren't supposed to pick the foliage a gardener picked a basil stem and gave the it to me, said it was good on pizza.",
          "SO many people, a lot of them in tour groups, it was very hot and humid and generally very busy. After a chaotic entrance (who knows which queue to get into??), we walk through the fantastic gardens. They must employ many gardeners to keep it looking this good \u2013 fantastic. The",
          "The Generalife is truly beautiful. Was busy today, we went for 10.30 a.m visit. It takes the 3 hours allotted time if you want to see everything. We strolled, sat a while, and absorbed the beauty. Gardens are great, people attending to them, small plots for vegetables etc.",
          "If you are visiting the Alhambra, make sure you visit the gardens of Generalist too, it's a very special area with a lot of history and the engineering of the water supplies are quite impressive.",
          "We were pleased that our ticket included a visit to this palace but really all there is to see is the gardens - you cannot see inside anything to understand what the rooms etc. would have looked like. The gardens were lovely in August and although it was pretty crowded, it was",
          "We loved the Alhambra and Generalife ,they are both stunning and in the latter there is a real sense of calm and tranquility .We recommend a guided tour of the site as they are extremely well organised and informative and add to the appreciation of this wonderful place",
          "One of must see places within complex of Alhambra, spectacular set of many various gardens, one different than the other. It\u2019s a real pleasure for an eye and amazing walk around. There are spectacular views over the place complex as well. Definitely one of the prettiest such",
          "Generalise is a modern garden with plenty of greenery designed and maintained within the historic Alhambra Fort. A walk inside generalife is interesting and worth it. The place within which generalife is created was the summer palace of ancient rulers. Water fountains, water",
          "It's grand, it's oppulent, it's everything you read and hear, yes, and it's large. We had the 7pm reservation which was a beautiful time of day, but wish we had booked earlier so we didn't feel rushed at the end. They have an 8pm closing time so even though an hour is typically",
          "This site is at the northeastern complex of the Alhambra and at the entrance ticket booth. The gardens are so beautiful. There are many water features and a beautiful view of the city of Granada from the hill. The building of the Generalife is also beautiful, although not as",
          "The idea is to get the heaven on earth and appreciate what God has created for us,in full harmony. Have a walk and imagine this area during the dark ages",
          "See also my review for Alhambra. This follows on from that. Truly amazing venues to reimagine that this was all built hundreds of years ago built, dug , planned and planted by hand Audio guide is a definite requisite!. Views are amazing",
          "Supposedly the summer home of the royals, Generalife is more surrounded by plants and fountains and is thus a little cooler in temperature. Perhaps not quite as impressive as the palacios, but still phenomenal.",
          "Spending a few hours strolling around these beautiful courtyard gardens and water features will be one of the highlights of a visit to Granada.",
          "Lovely garden with great views of the Alhambra palace and Granada. Beautiful water features and good planting.",
          "Surrounded by beauty, this is a place to relax and soak up the atmosphere. It is certainly worth a visit.",
          "Spending a few hours walking around the Generalife, one can only marvel at how it was built without modern tools. Indeed, the builders were very skilled at their crafts.",
          "One of the highlights of a visit to Alhambra is a walk around the gardens here at Generalife. Very photogenic - if you can avoid the masses of tourists.",
          "A lovely walk up the hill through the gardens for a view back to the Alhambra. Take the time to explore Generalife Gardens.",
          "Part of the Alhambra domain, the summer residence is less elaborated but cool with water parts, beautiful greenery and shade.",
          "I would highly recommend visiting the gardens in the morning as the light provides great opportunities for phenomenal pictures. I am sure it is possible in late afternoon, too. The gardens accent the beauty of this fascinating place.",
          "Sorry, it's a tourist milking mob scene. You wander about a lovely garden that with the exception of parts of a wall, had nothing to do with the Nasrid dynasty.",
          "We visited generalife in August. It was a beautiful day to see the summer palace residence of Muslim rulers of Granada. Place has been restored back well although it's not as incrdible as it might have been in 13th century.",
          "I found it a little cramped to enjoy it and too many areas were cordoned off. But OK when you are here anyway.",
          "If you are going to the Alhambra, be sure to book a tour that includes these beautiful gardens. The tours cover Alhambra, Nasrid palaces and the Generalife gardens all in 3 hours. The gardens are nice and cool on a hot day.",
          "So beautiful gardens, we were really in heaven, Granada is super hot in summer, do you can cool down here and relax.",
          "We will never tire of walking through the shady gardens and avenues of this place, accompanied by the calming background music of rippling water. The top flight of stairs with running water in the marble banisters (The Water Stairway) is simply sublime: cool, refreshing,",
          "Unbelievable flamenco performance in the beautiful gardens of Generalife next to Alhambra. It's 20Euros if you've already got an Alhambra ticket and our 14 and 16 year old kids were 6 Euros! At 10pm, it's not too hot. Dancing, staging, lighting, music was all wonderful. You can",
          "the design of the gardens and its layout is stunning. Beautiful fountains with summer houses in between the flora and forna. Incredible usage of water through the systems was an integral part of the Generalife.",
          "As a family we all enjoyed different parts of this tour. Our guide was a pleasure to spend the morning walking the gardens and the Alhambra. He gave the historical buffs in our family plenty of details and the rest of us fun stories about the people who lived there. It was great",
          "The Generalife gardens, vast and gorgeous, deserve ample time for basking in the shade, admiring the flowers (rose bushes and pomegranate trees were in bloom when we visited in mid-June), taking in the views, and meditating on the history of this amazing place.",
          "plan to spend several hours here as the gardens are meticulous and there is much to see without even going inside the cathedral, which is often impossible to get tickets.",
          "When visiting the Alhambra you must also visit the Generalife. It is magnificent with brilliant views of Granada and stunning gardens. There is a lot of walking involved so bring comfortable shoes and there are plenty of water fountains so bring a refillable bottle. Look out for",
          "Good to see right after the Alhambra. Gives you some different perspectives and the gardens are indeed quite nice.",
          "Generalfe was fantastic. So beautiful and so much to see. the gardens were all in bloom - it was crowded but we still loved every moment.",
          "This site is well worth the time and money to see. It's beautiful, the gardens are majestic, and you go back in history when you enter.",
          "Beautiful garden with breathtaking views of Grenada! We took a guided tour but i would have preferred to explore the gardens on my own (though this tour was included with the Alhambra tour). Really beautiful photo ops of Alhambra and grenada. Sneakers highly recommended,",
          "Stunning palace just like the Nasrid Palaces and absolutely amazing gardens (more like a park, really). It truly felt like walking in a little piece of paradise where nature and water overwhelmed us with a sense of calm and peace. We loved walking around and admiring the plants",
          "In the event that you are unable to get tickets for the Alhambra, it is still worth to visit the gardens and palace of the Generalife",
          "Plenty of drinking water fountains and shade, worth a visit. It was a busy and hot day, so maybe some extra sun umbrellas would have helped. Do it!",
          "We checked in very easily and quickly We were given a room upgrade for our wedding anniversary Stunning room in a half moon shape overlooking a traffic intersection but no road noise A balcony and some Palma ham,cheese and a bottle of wine Parking directly beneath the hotel",
          "Amazing views, far away and close by. So many hidden places to contemplate the gardens. Vistas deslumbrantes, de longe e de perto. Tantos lugares escondidos para contemplar os jardins.",
          "Spent hours wandering around the gardens and buildings enjoying the history and beauty of the location. Although it was mid morning I could get many photos without other people in them and highly recommend spending some time here.",
          "We loved spending time in the gardens on our visit to The Alhambra. It was very relaxing, with benches everywhere and lots of shade and views from every angle. Definitely recommend making the trek up the hill to see these spaces.",
          "I liked this as much as the Nasrid palace, perfect to be seen together as you get a feel of what life was like.",
          "La Alhambra and El Generalife are certainly the most anticipated visits in Granada. If you are in Granada, you simply must visit them. Do not get surprised and get locked out from accessing them. You must book and reserve weeks in advance before your visit. The best way is",
          "Beautiful gardens, stunning backdrop Spent hours just wandering around. Worth every penny and more. Even the walk up from gran via is a dream",
          "The whole Alhambra experience is well worth it but a morning in the gardens and associated buildings is highly recommended. We visited mid morning before it was too hot although there are many beautiful big trees and places to retreat from the sun. Your visit to the Alhambra",
          "Beautiful, beautiful! A very special experience - fascinating history, exquisite architecture. Tips for enjoying the day. It was a 40 degree day but luckily we went early 12.30pm palace slot. Take water and a hat. Started with coffee and brioche at the Hotel America just",
          "Having visited during winter I had the desire to return and see the gardens growing and in bloom. Unlike the general access ticket where you have a fixed entry time to the Palaces I only needed the 7 Euro Generaliffe and Alcazaba ticket. This was great as it gives you license to",
          "Best avoid the hot afternoon sun to visit this place best in the morning or late on the afternoon. Beautiful gardens and views",
          "Don\u2019t miss the general life at Alhambra. Take your time, wear good walking shoes, drink water and enjoy all that is around you. Although it was very very busy, we did not feel rushed nor crowded.",
          "Generalife is as lovely as visiting the Alhambra. The gardens are sublime that you can happily wander for hours",
          "When we began booking our trip too Spain, it was already too late to get tickets to Alhambra. This was the only option available and it was on our first night in Spain after getting into Madrid that morning. I worried I\u2019d be too tired but it did not disappoint. It is impeccably",
          "This is truly a special place. The gardens are incredible and to see how they used the water from the nearby mountains was very interesting",
          "In ask honesty, the garden needs at least 90 minutes to see it all. Beautiful arrangements of flowers and greenery. Some rare plants also. Reflects the history of the area.",
          "The gardens are absolutely gorgeous and by far my favorite thing by the Alhambra. The green plants and wooden benches fit so perfectly with the beautiful water spraying. It is also a great place to take many photos with memories of this experience.",
          "Lovely Gardens if that's your thing, but palaces and buildings are not as interesting as others in Spain. Nice views of the city but it was a bit hazy on the day. We were part of an organised tour of Spain. We were given an audio guide of the Generalife as part of the tour",
          "We visited in June, to enjoy the Martha Graham Dance Company's performance. A spectacular location, with a magical ambience, and the Alhambra Palace providing a priceless backdrop. The air was scented, thanks to the Generalife Gardens - Fabulous !!! The roses in particular",
          "It'a part of the same visit to Alhambra and really enjoyable. Again, one may admire what is made several centuries ago for all day.",
          "Walking through the Generalife, you can imagine the royalty over the centuries strolling through the gardens smelling the roses. This was spectacular at night, with impressive views looking down on the main palace, along with the various fountains and walls of flowers in the",
          "Upon entering the Alhambra we went to look at this first. Beautiful garden and buildings, well set out.",
          "The Generalife Gardens are well worth a visit. What an exquisite environment to meditate on the beauty of nature. The Spanish gardeners have actually been able to replicate the exact flowers that were grown in these gardens centuries ago. It's all very authentic and all very",
          "Beautiful palace, well located, with very interesting history and excellent view. Plan correctly your visit, with information and enjoy.",
          "Generalife is the quieter part of the Alhambra site but is definitely worth the effort to walk just that little bit more. As well as being attractive in its own right, it provides stunning views back towards the other palaces. Much fun can also be had watching the youngsters",
          "A guided tour is best another first class location for photos Popular spot be prepared for the crowds",
          "Generalife was part of the Alhambra tour. Our guide was knowledgeable.. The grounds are beautiful and provide many photo opportunities.",
          "Not bad I guess but I have traveled to so many palaces and seen so many courtyards that were better than the Generalife. The entire Alhambra and Generalife visit for me was a one time did it and checked it off experience.",
          "A delightful variety of fruit trees and flowers accompanied by neatly trimmed box hedges provides for an inspirational visit.",
          "with very cool gardens (literally) to cool one off. Amazing how the fountains, canals & bridges also flowed from upper to lower levels and had been engineered to do so for centuries.",
          "Great gardens and flower beds. Chilled atmosphere if not too crowded. Take your time and enjoy. There are plenty of benches for you to relax and enjoy the views.",
          "Great to see this special place which was historicly filled with romance. No need to miss this when your visiting",
          "Worth a visit. Alot of walking required. Not stroller accessible in some areas. Book tickets in advance, otherwise they will sell out and group tours from other companies will charge you a hefty amount.",
          "Not the best garden I\u2019ve ever seen but worth it for the views and the summer palace. When you buy your ticket make sure it includes this area as all areas don\u2019t appear to be included with some tickets.",
          "Go early to avoid the crowds and sit in the quiet of the beautiful gardens. Very well maintained. Stunning!",
          "The Generalife is adjacent to the Alhambra and can be and should be visited on same visit. Wonderful gardens and spectacular palace full of history and stories.",
          "Be sure to visit it before you go to Palacios Nazaries - very well manicured. Nice relaxing atmosphere and can make nice picture",
          "The recreational palace at Alhambra is of course not as impressive as the Nasir palace but very impressive in its own right.",
          "It is stunningly beautiful night view in Generalife. It's coolly in the night and less crowded as compared to the day time. The garden is neatly covered with different types of roses or flowers. The well-lit streets/houses seem like stars on the Earth from the windows of the",
          "Don't miss this area, and make sure you enter at the stated time on your ticket - or you may not get in at all! Take your camera / phone, lots of things to remember here.",
          "A very relaxing part of the overall Alhambra tour. Not too many elevation changes and can be done at your own pace when your scheduled tour has completed.",
          "The Generalife has a much different feel to the main Alhambra fortress. The formal gardens are amazing and so is the Generalife palace. You also get spectacular views looking back at the Alhambra. By far our favourite part.",
          "I wouldn't pay extra to see it unless you are into gardens. The gardens and surrounding area is nice to see but the inside is just ok and after visiting the Alhambra, kind of a let down. It's part of most tour packages but if you are going as an individual and paying extra for",
          "Along with the Alhambra, Generalife is a must see on your Grenada visit. Part of the whole Alhambra complex, be sure to give enough time to explore the beautiful gardens and relax in the shade. The fountains and water steps are sure to soothe the soul.",
          "We were only able to book tickets to the Generalife and Alcazaba on our trip to Granada. However, the gardens were overwhelmingly beautiful, shady and cool and entertained the kids for hours. In retrospect, more walking that the Gerealife and Alcazaba would have been too much",
          "The green space was very welcome after the bustle of the Nasrid Palaces. Beautiful gardens - just needs a little more seating areas in the shade.",
          "Very calming if it wasn't for the amount of tourists. Absolutely beautiful and gardens so well maintained.",
          "We had a guide - we listened through an ear piece . The tour was two hours- and very informative. Easy going and gave you the chance to stay after the tour and go back to places and take photos. A lovely afternoon.",
          "Combine this tour with the Alhabrama its well worth it. Go in the middle of the day and whilst it may be hotter the crowds are less",
          "Stunning views. Wear comfortable shoes. There are nice benches on the lower level facing Alhambra. Bring a camera or two. There are nice clean bathrooms on the lower level.",
          "The gardens were beautiful, as were the views. This was part of the Alhambra tour we took and we stayed in Generalife after the tour was over. The roses were in full bloom and magnificent. There are plenty of shaded areas and the gardens and pathways were exceptionally",
          "Stunning. Just beautiful. Very well maintained gardens with magnificent greenery and the most beautiful flowers. So colourful. So fragrant. The roses are truly amazing. The flows of water are so wonderful and lovely to hear.",
          "If the gardens had been maintained and/or restored to their beauty, it have have been worth it, but as it is now, it is not really that impressive. There are some good views of the ancient city and the nearby mountains from the garden though.",
          "We started our day at the Alhambra complex with a visit to Generalife. A great experience and a good introduction to the rest of the tour. Most recommended, especially with a guide!",
          "When I entered to this place i though Wowwwwwww........can\u2019t describe exactly how beautiful it is. Each corner is magic..... 5 hours spending in this place is worth it ... you will never regret to visit this place. You have to book in advance your ticket mainly 1 month in",
          "This is like a paradise with too many rare trees, flowers, butterflies, small water canals and stairs. This colorful and stunning gardens were the Summer palace and gardens of the Arab rulers of Granada. They were built during the reign of Muhammed II (1273-1302), Sultan of",
          "After a few hours walking through the palaces and the Alcazaba it was so wonderful to find these stunning gardens with their water features and vistas. Highly recommend.",
          "You will visit the Generalife as part of the Alhambra tour and it is fantastic. Its a bit of a walk up the hill but is worth it for the view of the Alhambra Complex alone.",
          "It\u2019s incredible how a garden can be so beautiful and colorful in a city with a semi-arid climate! You can spend hours just taking photos and looking at the flowers and small constructed lakes..",
          "The routes of the irrigation system is one of the most interesting things to see in the gardens. The restoration of traditional kitchen gardens is an interesting project. We saw this at the end of our Alhambra tour, and sadly, did not give it the time it deserved. Maps could",
          "We thought this was one of the most interesting areas of the Alhambra. The gardens and the summer palace were so very different and the views were magnificent.",
          "Worthwhile to see the historical site and associated gorgeous gardens. Nice vistas to be had. We would get a guide next time as being told during the visit gives you a better feeling than reading before hand.",
          "Visiting in May, the gardens were in full bloom. But these aren't just any gardens. Moorish influences are everywhere in the layout with fountains, plantings, types of plants and mixtures of veg and flowers to support every aspect of general life.",
          "Generalife Palace and gardens are separated from the rest of the Alhambra complex, and it takes 20 to 30 minutes walking through nice botanic gardens to get there from the area where Alcazaba, Palace of Carlos V and Palacios Nazaries are located. The gardens are very beautiful,",
          "I didn\u2019t plan ahead and couldn\u2019t get tickets for the main buildings in Alhambra, so I just got the Generalife night ticket. Was only 5 euros and I was so glad I did it. Pretty quick tour - stayed about an hour - because at night a lot of paths are closed off. But the gardens",
          "Well worth a visit, be sure to wear flat comfortable shoes and I would avoid summer peak season as very hot and its very open.",
          "Lots of different fountains around the property made this worthwhile to me. The gardens are well maintained and enjoyable to walk through.",
          "Most romantic summer palace. Not too opulent. Hut amazing natural beauty. The views are simply wonderful. Worth going with a guided tour",
          "So beautiful! If you\u2019re a history, garden or architecture lover, make sure you visit this place and plan to spend at least 2-3 hours to walk around and enjoy the scenery. I highly recommend a guided tour to maximize your experience.",
          "A wonderful garden to visit while inside the Alhambra. Well manicured. Interesting variety of plants. Beautiful views.",
          "Lovely but extremely crowded so there was no opportunity to spend anytime just looking. We were on a guided tour which I would recommend",
          "Part of the Alhambra complex, this is across a small valley from the rest of the buildings. There are several different gardens, all different in style and full of plants and flowers. We visited in early March and there were peonies, iris and the wisteria was just starting to",
          "This place is in Alhambra, definetely not in city center. Tourists can get confused a lot. Change the spot please.",
          "We walked here from our hotel and it was a great way to arrive. It was really my favorite part of the Alhambra. I suggest going early in the day to avoid the larger crowds.",
          "Generalife is a \u201cmust see.\u201d The Alhambra complex is quite amazing but the Generalife adds so much to the visit. This is the place the Moorish rulers went to rejuvenate and excuse themselves from the crowds. The flowers and water features are exquisite.",
          "As with the Alhambra, virtually all the negative reviews are driven by ticket issues. Book in advance and pay attention to ticket details and all will be well, and well worth it. The gardens were so beautiful that we came up with some ideas for our home efforts, and the palace",
          "I highly recommend visiting early in the morning, as we did. Easy parking, no crowds, lovely and cool. The gardens and palace are magnificent and extremely well maintained. The audio guides are excellent. Concise and informative. Thoroughly lived up to expectations",
          "This was the best part of our visit to Alhambra. It was not as crowded as the main area and had magnificent gardens and surrounds. Its a classic example of architecture that has been designed to accomodate the seasons with water features and the beautiful colours and scents of",
          "Let's put it clear: the garden is very beautiful and the view is amazing. However I didn't find this place as unique and original as it always presented. Just thinking about it for a minute and I could name a few almost identical places in other European countries. Considering",
          "If you can afford only to see the gardens then it is worth the time as they are absolutely exquisite. They are arranged over different levels, around small courtyards and fountains. You can lose yourself and the best time to visit is April to may when all the plants are in full",
          "We were there at the end of April and everything was blooming! Not hard to see why the Muslims envisioned paradise as a garden once you have visited these gardens.",
          "I could live here! Just loved the gardens and what I saw of the buildings, which wasn't much unfortunately. Go early or late - tour groups tend to spoil one's visit here.",
          "This is another must see place if you are visiting Granada. April was very busy so trying to get a good photograph was just about impossible, but it is worth visiting",
          "The area is huge and beautiful gardens including in courtyards inside the building. Very pleasant walk.",
          "Don\u2019t miss these gardens on your visit to Alhambra! If your lucky the roses are in full bloom! The beautiful gardens, the fountains, the majestic arches, all amazing!! Don\u2019t miss it!!!",
          "We went in April when the gardens were in full bloom, the scents of the different flowers was incredible. A combined tour of the Alhambra and Generalife not to be missed. Must pre-book.",
          "Luckily it was sunny (on a rainy day) and we managed to capture the beauty of the gardens. Definitely worth exploring.",
          "I visited here as part of my guided tour around Alhambra as the same ticket allows you access to Generalife. This was the summer palace and boasts beautiful gardens as well as interior design work with tiles and plasterwork. Well worth a visit for the beautiful interior and",
          "This is a perfect place to go and probably THE place, along with Alhambra to see in this entire area. It is also a MUST-SEE experience!",
          "This was the least appealing part of the Alhambra for me. The walk to the buildings has very nice views but the gardens, even though very green, were a bit underwhelming. The area with the fountains was pretty and one could just picture the king spending time here for",
          "BOOK AHEAD...way ahead! We were only able to get tickets for the Generalife and Gardens. The palace entry were all booked. Still, with the audio-guide, it was very enjoyable. The skip-the-line tours can be available last minute, but they're super expensive compared to what",
          "You need to have reasonable mobility to explore properly. Busy gardens, not really the place to stop and chill, though if you can grab a seat do! Views are beautiful and the mountains too. Busy",
          "Water symbolizes life for the ancient architects and residents of this garden and summer palace. This place is luxurious with water fountains in all directions, especially the Patio of the Sultana where it provides sound, beauty and natural air conditioning.. Geometry prevails",
          "The Generalife is out by itself but an essential part of a visit to the Alhambra Palace. Remember it's time orientated entry in relation to your morning or afternoon ticket.",
          "Majestic, large fruit, vegetable and ornamental gardens adjacent to the Alhambra. Impressive and enhanced by cats.",
          "take the time to walk the gardens during your visit to Alhambra. They are beautiful and the grounds are filled with all types of flowers, shrubs and trees and magnificent views of the Alhambra and the city.",
          "Even if you're not into gardens, taking a walk here is worth your time. The way the pipe in water via the stairs, the architecture of both buildings and gardens is amazing.",
          "And to think we almost missed it because we were exhausted at the end of our day. In hindsight, I'd have done this first and then move on to the main Medina area, especially as there are exits at the bottom of h tree complex which would see you so much closer to the city centre.",
          "This was a fascinating outside event around the alhambra.the guide gave us valuable insights into life at the alhambra.over time and the beaitoful buildis brought to life what life would be like in earlier times.",
          "Visited as part of a trip to the Alhambra (one ticket covers the Alcazar, garens and Generalife but not the palaces). The water gardens are beautiful and must be really cooling in the summers. The walk through the gardens also offers lovely views across the city and to Albayzin",
          "The Generalife is the \"garden\" part of the Alhambra and includes some buildings. It has sculpted shrubbery, etc.",
          "Beautiful gardens within the Alhambra complex, with lots to see even in January. Don't miss this off your Granada itinerary!",
          "If you're in Granada you have to visit Alhambra and Generalife. We chose a guided tour, and we are glad that we did. It was so beautiful and interesting. Lots of tourists, even if it's low season. Recommend this place, but remember to book tickets in advance.",
          "Generalife were the royal gardens and summer palace for Nasrid rulers (Muslim rulers) of Granada. Gardens are a part of Alhambra and as being on the top of the hill, are a perfect location for scenic views and shots of the city of Granada. While walking around royal gardens one",
          "The definition of sublime, shares the experience of Generalife: of such excellence, grandeur, or beauty as to inspire great admiration or awe",
          "In the heat of a Granada day the Generalife was a beautiful respite from the sun. To walk in the garden and hear the water running was heaven on earth",
          "Our lives are crazy. Going to the Alhambra and then to Generalife gives all a chance to regroup and unplug and remember what it\u2019s like to truly be in the moment. The sound of water, the beauty of the vegetation, the fountains, the gardens, the peaceful serenity cannot be",
          "Huge garden but the main attraction are the the gardeners who keep this place looking like an over-excessive garden of rich people. Note: it offers shade so scout that out at all times. The watering system is truly amazing - if you care. Also the people who cut the hedges are",
          "Be sure to include this with your tour of Alhambra. If you get a tour guide, be sure his/her English is not so heavily accented that you cannot understand the narrative. If we had to do it again, we would use an audio tour as we could not understand our guide\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d",
          "Generalife is a masterpiece! although it was renovated, im sure they kept the main lines of the garden setups.. its just a huge pleasure to visit the gardens and relax underneath a wild orange tree",
          "We toured Alhambra w/ a guide for 3.5 hours. That tour was wonderful, but Generalife was a real surprise. The gardens here were lovely and it was such a surprise to learn that it was their get-away next door to their permanent residence. We learned so much here that it was all",
          "If you can't get into the full Alhambra, this is well worth the trip. It's the Spanish portion of the complex.",
          "Compared to the Nazrid Palaces, which allows limited people at any time, this place was a madhouse. It was crowded and I felt I was back in India in a bazaar. There were busloads of Chinese tourists who were very rude, inconsiderate and pushy. Sad, considering the attraction",
          "Must visit. It's very maintained and offers lot of history. Do make sure to also visit the palace when you book thistrip",
          "This is not to be missed. The gardens are beautiful with rows of cypress trees. The gardens are similar to French gardens. Not to be missed",
          "It is difficult to explain how we feel about Generalife. It would be better to see the gardens and palace in separate days to allow the time needed to take everything in.",
          "The Generalife is a part of the Alhambra Complex and you will get in there with the general admission Alhambra Ticket. The gardens are so beautifully kept and the palace with the fountains is gorgeous. Dont expect any furniture inside, its just the shell, but the gardens, the",
          "The gardens were really beautiful. The water features were gorgeous and made for some beautiful pictures.",
          "If Adam & Eve were here they would have been obsessed with selfies like everyone else and the history of the world would have played out differently. The garden goes on forever and even offers shade.",
          "When you visit the Alhambra, you have the option to add on a visit to this palace as well. The gardens are lovely and the offer a great view of the town and the Alhambra.",
          "Part of the Alhambra visit and right after the palace. Excellent views. Well worth it and not to be missed.",
          "Another bucket list item, ticked off. Beautiful gardens and restoration. The fountains although not original to the Muslim version...where glorious.",
          "Not to be missed. Book your tickets on line and well in advance. Plan to arrive early as it gets quite crowded early.",
          "Visited the generalife mid morning following our visit to the Nasrid Palace. Fantastic views both down toward the old town of Granada and also up toward the Serria Nevada mountains (still with snow on in March). Like Alhambra the gardens are lovely, as are the buildings, but not",
          "Superb, details magnificient.Trees, flower blooming, the water, the silence... I wish just to see on the night visit 9in summer)",
          "We visited as part of a tour which provided interesting information and background history. The tour was somewhat rushed however and it would have been nice to have a slower pace to take everything in. Beautiful location above the Alhambra, very busy.",
          "This attraction is just outside the walls of the bigger attraction. It\u2019s on a hillside and is quite beautiful. The building itself is more of the same as to the other area. The gardens are very nice and have several water features. It\u2019s definitely worth seeing when on a visit",
          "Yup, this is situated just above and beside Alhambra. Beautiful setting and easy to find. Bring you camera and your walking shoes.",
          "Well, just go, it is incredible. Being camera and notebook. Very evocative. Extraordinary experience in a lifetime of travel.",
          "We toured this as part of the tour of Alhambra. It was very pleasant to view. We were there on a beautiful day and the views were amazing.",
          "The gardens will be amazing in the spring/ summer when all the blooms are out and the views are fabulous from the terraces",
          "Not the star of the show in Alhambra, but interesting as part of the overall experience. Maybe 40 minutes or so.",
          "We came on a private tour at 1pm and it was fairly quiet. The gardens are wonderful. A visit to Alhambra and Generalife is all together in my mind.",
          "Nice place to visit, quite calm, but overcrowded and rushed. Nice water features and some good restorations",
          "Spent the entire day in the Alhambra and Generalife and it was all stunning. Worthwhile pre purchasing tickets and organise your visit around the fixed entry time for the Nazrid Palaces.",
          "I loved the gardens and fountains of Generalife. It felt a world away from the rest of the Alhambra. So relaxing to just sit by one of the numerous fountains and enjoy the sun and serenity.",
          "Lovely garden with nice view to the Alhambra. The park is easy to access and is very clean and green.",
          "Beautiful gardens, right next to the Alhambra. Don't miss it out by only focusing on its neighbor. The most interesting part is the Generalife Palace, a recreational Palace where the sultan could escape the intrigues of the Alhambra court. Here are several gems to discover like",
          "Originally the Sultans gardens but taken over by some 'pesky' Christians a good few hundred years ago !! Even in winter these gardens are delightful. Plenty of garden architectuee to give height and interest. Imaginative use of water too. Just beautiful.",
          "Walking through, it is easy to imagine the Sultan spending time here. It\u2019s beautifully laid out and cool, just what is wanted on a hot summer day",
          "A guided night time tour is a great way to discover this always crowded gem. We had a great guide with many interesting stories and details about the buildings.",
          "A lovely part of the Alhambra. The sultan and his intimates spent summers here, to escape the court and the heat. It was lovely even in January.",
          "Beautiful gardens even in Winter. I think it would be worth visiting each season to check out the changes.",
          "I have never seen such a big and well made garden. Maybe the most impressive I have seen all over Europe so far!",
          "We visited in winter, so the gardens were not in bloom, but the symmetry, water, and birdsong is beautiful in any season. With little effort you can imagine the Sultans and Sultanas strolling through this lovely site.",
          "The stunning edifice, within the Alhambra is a must. It oozes palacial history. One can imagine the original residents relaxing in the gardens.",
          "We visited as part of our tour of the Alhambra but given the time of year there wasn\u2019t a great deal to see. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a very different story during spring and summer and the gardeners were hard at work. It does however provide some great views over the Alhambra and gives a",
          "If you see Alhumbra you see Generalife ... the winter Palace section of Alhumbra. This whole complex is a must see ...",
          "Well-manicured gardens and soothing sounds of water from the fountains that are gravity-fed. The water steps are particularly enjoyable. Relive the good lives of the Sultan and Sultana! (Though watch out for a knife in the back and for approaching Christians). Of course,",
          "Just before the entrance, the curator of the place built an amazing garden for you to walk through. The Generalife itself is historical and beautiful. Giving you a glimpse of how the sultanates of the past spend their time away from the palace (though not too far away).",
          "Generalife is attached to the Alhambra and was part of our tour. It is fascinating and well worth a visit!",
          "Entrance is via the Alhambra site and it is best to pre-book your tickets and don't be too late. If you get there too late they are quite strict and we did see people turned away - albeit very politely. As with the Alhambra I would suggest taking food and drinks in with you, as",
          "Gorgeous gardens and views, even in the winter! We loved the Alahambra and the gardens are great. It's worth the walk. Just make sure to book a reservation before you go, and make sure you are at the Palace no later than 60 minutes after the time of your ticket, or you will not",
          "The palace is beautiful, but people working in alhambra are not reliable when giving info. We have been told that generalife was accessible with strollers, but we arrived there after 20mins walk and they told us \"we know, our colleagues say it is accessible but it's not true\"...",
          "Nights in the Spanish Gardens by Manuel de Falla came to my mind when walking the gardens of the Generalife. What else?",
          "Went early and was nice to walk around prior to the crowds. Takes around 40 mins comfortably. Start here from the main entrance.",
          "Such an interesting history. The gardens are what gave this site its world heritage status as they carefully researched the plants and lay out of what would oriogionally be on the site.",
          "The gardens can be crowded so go early morning not first thing try around 10am. It helps to get some background reading in if you are not going to hire a guide. The plantings in October were sparse if you want to see them in full bloom you should go earlier than October",
          "You can't miss this place out when you go explore Granada! There is so much to shoot. Must b\u00e8 amazing in spring \ud83d\udd25",

          "After a good visit of Palacios Nazaries, what a good place to walk and appreciate the beauty of a typical Alhambra garden and an amazing view of the Sierra Nevada. And if some Sun is present, it's delicious.",
          "Excellent, perfect, enjoyable, knowledgeable, honest, fair, just, balanced, excellent teacher, patient and kindness. These are just some of the words we would use to describe our tour with Julio our tour guide. Both our languages were accommodated Spanish and English and the",

          "Realy fantastic day out. We went with our 6m old and it was pram friendly. With a few exeptions. They had designated areas to leave the stroller and luggage. They also had baby change in a few areas. The buildings and gardens are amasing. Worth the visit. Buy tickets online",
          "Located just a short walk from the main palace it is well worth to make the visit. It is included with the same ticket. This place has beautiful garden and they still Keep the farming going as it has been for centuries.",
          "I would visit Alhambra - Alcazaba and Nasri Palace, first, then visit Generalife. Not the other way around. Why? Generalife, which is a garden, has so much to see and you would be exhausted after walking on Generalife. Also there is a \"natural\" exit and walkways, coming out",
          "Where all types of flowers, fruits and vegetable are planted like pieces of art. Well worth a walk through, especially in the summer or autumn.",
          "A visit to the Generalife is a natural extension to one of Alhambra. It helps to make you understand the cultural excellence that was the style of the sultans who lived there. The courtyard gardens are delightful. The use of water and orange trees as well as the views over the",
          "the generalife is one of my favourite parts of the Alhambra. Everythign is well kept and the views from it are superb. Great place for photos",
          "Beautifully designed garden near the top of the Alhambra hill. It is a must see and it is included in the one ticket anyway",
          "The Generalife is the summer palace in Granada. The palace is lovely, not as lovely on the inside as the Alhambra is. The gardens are simply spectacular and are well worth walking through. I would strongly recommend visiting.",
          "The little sister to the Alhambra, with gardens and buildings in perfect harmony, wonderful colours, shapes and amazing views.",
          "We toured the spacious grounds of Generalife with our guide Carmen. What a magnificent place to visit. The history and beauty of the place is incredible. Each room in the Alhambra was more breathtaking then the one before. The gardens were spectacular. Carmen was an excellent",
          "We ended up going to generalife since the general ticket were soldout, it was great to see the beautifully crafted gardens from the old times.",
          "Gorgeous place of the Alhambra, with views that are breath taking! we visited in November so didn't see many flowers blooming, but did get to see some pomegranate here and there. The staircase of water is in this area which is also an amazing feat to see how they captured water",
          "As part of The Alhambra complex, the gardens are beautiful. So much history in the Moorish Gardens. We found them very well maintained. Such variety of plants, fountains and buildings. Take your time and enjoy.",
          "Beautiful landscaped garden with a diversity of plants, shrubs and trees. A water irrigation planted from history, which provides the multitude of small fountains with water.",
          "The garden and water features were peaceful and allowed you to sense the tranquillity. The views across to the main Alhambra site were excellent.",
          "Not like the Alhambra in terms of beauty and detail, but also worth visiting. I have seen beautiful gardens in other locations, and is comporable. The edge here is the history.",
          "This is all part of the Alhambra Palace - will need a ticket to get in but is definately worth a visit",
          "It rained when we decided to visit Generalife..well I guess you cant have it all..lol Mother nature was truly on the loose..lol Our visit was part of the ticket to Alhambra. This garden is stunning and truly makes you want to become an gardener.. (ok maybe not) but sure makes",

          "So nice to visit these beautiful gardens which are refreshing when facing the crowds at Alhambra. I took home a few ideas for my own gardening. If possible try to get tickets for a music or dance performance which occasionally take place in the summer. That would really make",
          "Having visited previously in summer a couple of years ago , this was my first late season visit . The gardens are still looking good with nice flowers and on a nice sunny autumn day a really nice walk round for an hour or so. There tends to be fewer people in here than in the",

          "We visited the house of the sultans, called Carmen and the adjacent, vast gardens during a visit to the Alhambra and Granada. The tour has to be prebooked through a guide. The venue is stunning and parts of the house are under restoration. The gardens are beautifully laid",
          "Even in the autumn, the Generalife is worth a visit. You won't have many flowers but you'll still get the greenery, the gorgeous layout of the gardens, and the palace of the Generalife with its fountains and spectacular views. If you have tickets to the Nasrid palace, when you",

          "I\u2019d fight the government to keep this too! What an incredible work of architecture and landscaping. The moors has an incredible knowledge about water. This place is amazing.",
          "my favourite part was the overlooks of the city through the archways . the crisp blue sky and the plaster and stone works, the detailed trimming of the dense foliage outlined against the ancient plaster works is picture perfect . a great respite for us in March while",

          "Very nice gardens and summer palace of the Alhambra. When we visited at the end of October I felt it was much smaller than I expected. I am not sure if some of it was closed or if it is actually smaller than I had imagined. However, it should not be missed on any tour of the",
          "Generalife is one segment of the Alhambra complex consisting of several stunning gardens and a sultan's palace. This is a place of remarkable beauty, that kept our camera shutters clicking away. If visiting Alhambra, schedule enough time to visit the entire complex, including",

          "We enjoyed the garden just fine. We could have skipped it all together but it was a nice stroll. Nice way to spend a summer day.",
          "It's confusing. The Palace, the Alhambra, the Generalife. It's really parts of the same thing, overall the Alhambra as the catch-all. The Alhambra though is really the fortress. The Generalife refers to the gardens and the Palace is the Palace. It's all accessible through",
          "By the time we got there it was very busy, but this did not detract from the delight of the place. Taking time to stroll slowly is a good thing to do. And the views across the valleys are amazing.",

Be careful of the Berger\u2019s and the fortune teller lady\u2019s stop you in the middle of the street touch you and start talking. We did not like that and you have to pay them if not they get rude",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Royal Chapel of Granada (Spanish: Capilla Real de Granada) is an Isabelline style building, constructed between 1505 and 1517, and originally integrated in the complex of the neighbouring Granada Cathedral. It is the burial place of the Spanish monarchs, Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand, the  Catholic Monarchs. Apart from these historical links, this building also contains a gallery of artworks and other items associated with Queen Isabella.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Nasrid dynasty of Granada was the last Moorish dominion of Al-Andalus to fall in the Reconquista (Reconquest). This occurred in 1492 during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, with the conquest of the city being an important stage of their combined reign. On September 13, 1504, they declared that they wanted their remains to be taken to Granada, and to this effect a royal charter was issued at Medina del Campo, Castile-Le\u00f3n, for the Royal Chapel to be built. The charter states:\n\nFirst we ordain that in the Cathedral of the city of Granada it made an honest chapel in which are, when the will of Our Lord be, our bodies buried. This chapel will be called Of the Kings under the invocation of Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist.\nThe Royal Chapel was built between 1505 and 1517 in Isabelline Gothic style and dedicated to St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, with the construction under the direction of Enrique Egas in Gothic style. Juan Gil de Honta\u00f1\u00f3n, Juan de Badajoz the Elder and Lorenzo V\u00e1zquez de Segovia were also involved in the construction project.\nThe 16th century was the century of the greatest splendour of the Royal Chapel. Construction occurred during the lifetime of King Ferdinand, and the Chapel flourished under his successor Emperor Charles V, with the church decorated, and the supporting institution being enhanced.\n\nThe late 18th and early 19th century brought difficulties to the institution. These were linked to political changes, economic difficulties and the profound change in church-state relations. The liberal regime ended with the Patronage regime and the original foundations of the institution becomes a fully ecclesiastical entity.\nSome stability was brought about by the Concordat of 1851 which was followed by a Royal decree of reorganization of the Royal Chapels. Isabel II, who visited the Chapel in 1862, promoted a new organization. With the Restoration a new balance is achieved, which is manifested from the years of the fourth centenary of the capitulation of Granada and the discovery of the Americas. As a result of this renewal, this period also witnessed the first scientific publications on the Chapel and its art collection.\nDuring the 20th century there was growth in the historical and artistic, archival and musical aspects of the Chapel. The museum was created by Royal decree in the year 1913. With the development of the tourist industry in Spain in the second half of 20th century, the Royal Chapel became one of the top tourist attractions of the city of Granada. Recently there has been a restoration with the collaboration of the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda and the Foundation Caja Madrid, along with other public and private contributions.\n\n\n== Architecture and sculpture ==\n\nThe interior of the chapel follows the same model as the Monastery of San Juan de los Reyes in Toledo. It has four side chapels, creating the form of a Latin cross and a nave with a Gothic ribbed vault. The choir has a centered arch down to its base, and a crypt.\nThe passage to the presbytery creates a luminous effect to symbolize the sun and the light of justice (in an Albertian, Neo-Platonic sense). There is a hierarchy of the transept dedicated to mausoleum, which is separated by a monumental decorated grille forged by Bartolom\u00e9 Ordo\u00f1ez.\nIn the center of the transept lie the tombs of Isabella and Ferdinand (sculpted by Domenico Fancelli) and Joanna and Philip (by Bartolom\u00e9 Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez). The tombs are set high and mark their priority and are almost at the height of the altar (symbolizes the closeness of the kings to God).\n\n\n== Content ==\n\nIn the Royal Chapel can be seen the graves of:\n\nIsabella I of Castile, Queen of Castile, and of her husband\nFerdinand II of Aragon, King of Aragon.The tomb is by Domenico Fancelli.\nIn another tomb, work by Bartolom\u00e9 Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, are represented:\n\nJoanna of Castile \"the Mad\", Queen of Castile and Aragon, and her husband:\nPhilip I of Castile \"the Handsome\", King jure uxoris of Castile; his heart is buried in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges, Belgium.In the crypt is also the sarcophagus of the  infante Miguel da Paz, Prince of Portugal, grandson of the Catholic Monarchs, who died as a child.\nThe most important parts inside the temple are its main altar, the main fence and the crypt with the five lead coffins containing the remains of kings and the little Infante, each recognizable by the initials of their names. However, since it still dedicated to Catholic worship, at certain times it is closed to tourists.\nOne may also visit the Sacristy-Museum, with the legacy of the Catholic Monarchs. Highlights of its gallery of paintings are works of the Flemish, Italian and Spanish schools, with paintings by authors like Juan de Flandes and Hans Memling as well as a rare example by Sandro Botticelli (Agony in the Garden) and other 15th century painters like Rogier van der Weyden, Dirk Bouts, Perugino and Bartolom\u00e9 Bermejo.  Goldsmiths work on display includes the crown and the scepter of the Catholic Monarchs; tissues and books of the Queen.\nIn the angle between the Royal Chapel and the Sagrario is the Lonja, constructed in the year 1518 and dedicated to banking and commerce. It has recently been restored and can be visited, both for its architectural interest (the facade, the coffereds) and for the objects displayed inside (paintings, furniture).\n\n\n== Chapel Masters ==\n\nSince its founding and for centuries, the Royal Chapel had masters who were in charge of the composing of music for liturgical functions, and direction of all matters relating to its interpretation. Between the functions of these musicians also found the education of the voices of the infantillos (or sixes) and care of the archive. To access to charge, applicants had to submit a public competition with ordeals of composition and musical knowledge, the result could only be the granting of the charges to genuine artists. Among the files that make up the music catalog of this institution stand out for their number and their extraordinary chronological extension, the corresponding to the work of Antonio Cavallero, who was appointed to the charge in 1757, replacing Pedro Furi\u00f3 and officially it leaves to die around 1822, closing an interesting relationship of tenured masters.\nOther notable chapel masters of the Royal Chapel included:\n\nBernardino de Figueroa \u2013 later bishop at Brindisi in Italy 1571\u20131591.\nRodrigo de Ceballos (1561\u20131581)\nAmbrosio Cotes (1581\u20131596)\nAlonso de Mena (1587-1646) born in Granada.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nSpanish Monarchs since Charles V have been buried in the crypt at the Escorial in Castile.\nPrior to Isabella I, royal families were buried in diverse cities in the Iberian peninsula.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "This is the first major Cathedral that I have been in while a mass was in progress. Preparations were also underway for the Jan 2 parade so the Square was full of trumpeters and officials in costume. The church is worth a visit, the parade not so much.",

          "Five euros to enter and unable to take photos, never mind. The audio guide is ok, to be fair half the time I wasn't listening. The interior is stunning though!",
          "This is worth a quick visit while you're in this part of the city, and it is near a location where you can catch a minibus up to the Alhambra. The tombs are elaborate and impressive, although you won't get a great view of the king's and queen's realistic marble faces because of",
          "Had a wonderful time at this beautiful chapel. The audio guide is difficult to follow, as others have noted. Outside the small chapel\u2019s exit and just down the alley on the left there is a free art gallery. The art is eclectic. There is a very clean washroom on the third floor.",
          "Recommend visiting it with the Cathedral combined - Good half day visit. Also do the walk of the old city around the chapel and cathedral.",
          "It is more interesting than the cathedral but with both venues being 5 euros each it's just not got enough to interest anyone who is not religious. Choose this over the cathedral if you wish to see the coffins of Isabella and Ferdinand and a couple of Flemish masterpieces.",
          "Worth a visit- allow about 45 min to an hour. The price includes the audio guide. This was fine but could have been split into shorter sections as it became difficult to work out where you should be looking. Interesting to hear more of Isabella and to see her lead coffin and her",

          "The visit to the Royal Chapel is good to combine with a visit to the huge cathedral next door. The audioguide is a bit long, but informative. Look out of the paintings of Botticelli.",
          "I enjoyed the chapel very much. We toured it with our guide Federico Abril who gave us great insights and information that I don\u2019t know that we would have gotten on our own. I was very disappointed that they do not allow photos to be taken inside the chapel.",

          "The cathedral and the chapel are both beautiful and were a real highlight of the day. I was on a bus and wish I had more time but I did get to walk around inside. It was a great spot and you can feel the history inside.",
          "Everyone is drawn to see the Cathedral of the Incarnation in Granada, but you could be so easily overwhelmed into thinking there is nothing else to see here. Well, just two right turns out of the Cathedral brings you to the Capilla Reial and a step back into history.",
          "I went on a really good walking tour on my second day in Granada. Our guide was excellent, and gave us lots of pointers for the rest of our time there. One recommendation was to visit the Royal Chapel. I am so glad I did. Filled with so many beautiful works of art, and kitted",
          "There were two items that made a big impression. The massive pipe organ that looked like golden layers on a wedding cake and the huge books/tombs, each drawn with incredible detail. My only wish is that I\u2019d been fortunate enough to listen to the pipe organ play. The",

          "The cathedral is beautiful and worth a visit in it's own right. The chapel was our favorite though, there is an audio guide that walks you through all the rooms and to the tombs of Ferinand and Isabella. Definitely worth your time!",

          "The Cathedral is slightly tucked away just off the Via de Colon and very close to the Plaza de Bib-Rambla. The front facade of the cathedral and the Plaza de las Pasiegas is a lovely setting and gives the best view of the cathedral exterior. Inside the Cathedral the most",

          "The audio guide (included in price) was having very long \u2018chapters\u2019; approx 4-5min each. Chapel was a nice watch but not a must-watch. In our experience The outside was more attractive than the inside. Haven\u2019t been into the royal chapel based on discouraging Rough guide",

          "First of all, I hate it when religious institutions charge you to see cathedrals because it doesn\u2019t seem very in line with their doctrines, but beyond that there was just nothing to see inside the cathedral. It was very bland on the inside and the audio guide was not well",
          "I have seen some cathedrals but this one must top the list as huge and very decorative. The royal chapel is a must. It\u2019s history alone is worthy of your visit. Inside lay King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. It\u2019s not morbid, just peaceful.",

          "This over the top chapel has to be seen to be believed. It is worth paying the extra to enter and the tombs are beautifully crafted; a must-see",
          "After the Alhambra, and a wander through the Albacin neighborhood, I would probably consider this the next thing to do in Granada. I found the audio tour frustrating. I am not a Christian, and the discussions of each site required some knowledge of the bible (seems to me) to",
          "Bang in the city centre, such a lovely place to walk through as you are on the way to alcaiceria and the churros are nearby!",
          "An absolute must when visiting Granada. The biggest & most impressive Cathedral we\u2019ve ever visited & the audio guide was excellent. Highly recommend.",
          "While we didn't have the time to see the inside of the cathedral during our recent short visit to Granada we did see it from outside. Close up you really don't get a feeling for how large the building is but we also saw it from the high vantage point of the Alhambra and this was",
          "Only saw it from the outside as it was closed by the time we got there. Magnificent in stature and design. Looked like it was golden in the afternoon light.lots of eateries surround the area. Delightful",
          "Sorry but another must see for you to factor in to your visit to Granada. The audio tour bought the whole thing to life although it did dance around the areas you were in a bit. The history is captivating as is the significance of the events that led to it being built. Takes 2-3",
          "Very nice cathedral with excelent guiding system. Furthermore we have visited the roof 211 steps one way. But is was very wortwihle because you have a wide view over the city with on the background the mountains. On the other side you will find the sea with the harbour. We",
          "In the royal chapel, pictures are not allowed. The Cathedral allows picture taking. Beautiful cathedral.",
          "Vaulted ceilings, precious artifacts, lots to see. Stop in and visit when in Granada. Tombs of Ferdinand and Isabella.",
          "Well worth a visit. Interesting background for Granada's history. Amazing carved guilded altars with figures representing various biblical stories, interesting paintings, fascinating visit.",
          "We had free admission to the Cathedral because we had the Alhambra card, otherwise I might not have gone in. It's a lovely cathedral, lighter than most and quite large. There is an audio guide included which is a little over effusive but interesting. Definitely worth a see,",
          "Beautiful cathedral, well worth seeing. As others have mentioned, the audioguide, included in the entrance fee of 5 Euros, is very informative, if a little long winded. Lost our place in it several times! But just to look at the treasures is enough. Due to queues and coach",
          "Beautiful in and out side. There was even and missa going on and the priest stoped the missa just for US to see. Nice part but was a bit occured. One thing to see. We just passing by during night and still beautiful.",
          "It is definitely worth a visit for people interested in art and history, the building itself is very beautiful. Also worth going to see the collection of northern renaissance paintings. The audio guide is very informative if a little long winded, photography is not allowed in",
          "We were in a bit if a rush visiting this cathedral and that was a pity as there is so much to see. Architecture and history comes alive with the audio guide and you need time to absorb it all.",
          "Husband and I visited in late September 2018 at 17:00, which gave us a little more than an hour to go through the Cathedral. We used the audio for a few of the areas but on others we just enjoyed admiring it without the commentary. This day, Granada was celebrating Patrona de",
          "The building is impressive and full of priceless antiques. Listened to the audioguide in the cathdrale but found the explanation a bit boring so when we visited the royal chapel, we did not bother with the audioguide again. I personally think that a quick look around is enough",
          "There is a charge but you get audio guide. Take headphones with you. I carry ear buds. The tour is about 30 minutes long. You can take longer if you want. The high lite of the tour for me was seeing the tombs of the king and queen.",
          "Spain is an incredible country with a rich history. When you see the Cathedral and the Royal Palace you realize how advanced they were at the time of Isabel and Ferdinand. The Cathedral and Royal Chapel are both spectacular. Do t miss either.",
          "100% worth checking out if your in Granada. It always amazes me how each Cathedral in Europe is independently unique. This one is no exception. Very astonishing architecture and well worth the 5 Euros entry fee. Don\u2019t miss this one. Also the audio explains everything very well",
          "This is an impressive Cathedral. Our visit coincided with Sunday mass so we sat down for the service. It was interesting to see the Mass even if we couldn't understand it. The organ music was beautiful and the singer had a beautiful voice.",
          "Not on the same scale as Sevilla cathedral or the Mesquita in Cordoba but still beautiful architecture.",
          "Spent an hour in this majestic Cathedral, audioguide excellent, the vestry was stunning. Artwork well worth seeing.",
          "Beautiful inside and out. Really large open space and so peaceful despite the number of visitors. For us,not as special as the sagrada familia but still well worth appreciating. The area around the cathedral is also great, with a souk area and plenty of cafes and restaurants.",
          "Reasonable entry fee, wonderful architecture and very informative pre recorded guide that you use on the way round.",
          "Situated near the Alcaiceria Bazaar at the centre of Granada, the construction of this wonder, started in the 16th century but hasn\u2019t been yet finished. Not that it displays any deficiencies from other Gothic Renaissance marvels. It contains magnificent carvings, paintings and",
          "The chapel is the burial place of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain. Beautiful architecture and art work in both the chapel and cathedral. Interesting history lesson - a must see in Granada. No photos allowed in the chapel, only in cathedral.",
          "The royal cathedral is beautiful, yet simple. The self guided tape tour is helpful and informative. There is access to the actual tomb of the ate royalty, as well as their artwork which has been beautifully preserved. Well worth the 5 euros.",
          "This Cathedral was beautiful! Is one of the biggest in the world. It also has the tomb of Christopher Columbus. Leave some time on your Sevilla trip to visit this marvel.",
          "This is actually two different attractions both of which cost 5 euros and have a free audio guide included. They have different opening times so it is worth checking before visiting. As they are two different sites I will review each separately. Granada Cathedral - This is a",
          "Both sites are worth a couple of hours. Audioguides were informative of strangely stilted. The sacrestries of both buildings contained some real treasures. Less interesting for our young teenage kids, for them one or the other might have been better.",
          "It\u2019s a great church to visit to see the architecture and stain glass windows. You get a free audio guide with the tour. The audio guide can be a little wordy in my opinion. If you have time, check it out.",
          "Really beautiful and worth a visit if you are around. Sit down for a few minutes and enjoy the rich history, nice decor and cool temperature inside. Just wondering why do you need to pay for visiting a church?",
          "The Royal Chapel is lovely. Audio guide is included with your ticket price- no pictures inside. The audio guide provided some great information, but it jumped around a bit, and we found it hard to follow. The cathedral is the second largest church in Spain. Its spacious",
          "The cathedral is beautiful and intimidating but that\u2019s the whole point of them. There\u2019s an image of a saint James (I think) standing on a soldier from the Islamic army. The English guide claims some outlandish nonsense mixed in with historical facts and stories. It\u2019s worth going",
          "We walked to the cathedral and found it Absolutely fantastic well worth a visit & the audio system was highly informative.",
          "Both are very nice to see and with a very rich heritage to discover through the audio guides. No pictures in the Royal Chapel, but the views are worth every minute of your visit. Don\u2019t miss if you are visiting Granada",
          "Liked the gold plated sculptures a lot. The audi guide is very helpful. I think it's the most gorgeous cathedral we have seen yet.",
          "Beautiful and well preserved building. It holds a small but important collection of Northern European paintings and some Italian Renaissance paintings including a Botticelli. Worth a visit.",
          "Seeing is believing, this was an amazing building with great history, the alters were stunning. This is a must see when travelling to the city",
          "The cathedral is vast (as they all seem to be in this part of Spain) but well worth a visit- audio guide included in admission price",
          "The Royal chapel is something special to me because it is the burial place of one of the most important and famous King/Queen duo in European history. Also the art is beautiful! The cathedral is not necessarily greater than any other Spanish cathedral for that time period but",
          "What a find-excellent audio guide means you don't miss anything. Uncrowded and well worth the 5 euro entrance",
          "The Cathedral is smack bang in the middle of town, surrounded by all sides with buildings, flats, cafes, restaurants. When you get inside you appreciate the sheer scale and majesty. The entrance fee is 5\u20ac per person and that includes an audio guide. Take your time and wander",
          "The cathedral does not look impressive from the outside, so I doubted why to pay 5\u20ac entrance fee. I am glad I did, the interior was well worth the money. A great place to visit.",
          "I wanted to compare the cathedrals of Seville and Malaga with Granada. Granada was well put together where the entrance fee included an audio guide in English. Lovely artefacts and architecture from the majestic centre piece to the intimate chapel at the end of the tour. Our",
          "The cathedral of Granada has some very beautiful exterior parts, inside I found it quite simple and empty in terms of marble and paint, it has also some chapels and a small display in the sacristy but no more I would recommend a visit inside though.",
          "We spent a lot more time here than we planned. The cathedral was really spectacular: even for a non-Christian like me! The building itself was spectacular, light and airy: really giving a sense of the divine. The various chapels and alters, many of them in different artistic",
          "I was very interested in the history of Queen Isabella, so I was drawn to this place. The artwork is beautiful. I highly recommend the audio tour.",
          "Beautiful art and churches. It\u2019s must see. I do feel though sometimes that\u2019s not for everyone but wow it\u2019s magnificent architecture",
          "Very majestic cathedral, especially interesting is the sacristy. But even more interesting is the Royal Chapel, good audio guide for both. There are some very significant Flemish works of art to see in the Royal Chapel.",
          "A very meaningful visit to this very beautiful cathedral steeped in history.Easy to spend at least 3 hours in total",
          "Its a very old and very ornate cathedral, with very high arch ceilings and beautiful glass art work in the windows it's worth a visit",
          "The outside is impressive, just because it is so huge. On the inside, lots of religious art, obviously. I thought it was nice that you didn\u2019t have to pay for the audio guide like, like everywhere else.",
          "This truly is an amazing building, the wealth is pretty overwhelming. It\u2019s worth doing the Royal Chapel as well although it\u2019s perhaps of more interest to art lovers.",
          "We visited both the cathedral and the Basilica de San Juan de Dios and ended up enjoying the Basilica far more. The cathedral is impressive to see from the outside, but in our view the inside did not justify the entrance fee.",
          "A very nice chapel excellent English audio guide take your own headphones as otherwise it\u2019s a phone to your ear. The tombs of the dead were quite creepy. Fantastic architecture.",
          "The cathedral was beautiful! The size of the doors and the hymn books were unreal. The burial site for Isabelle and Ferdinand was interesting, as was the chance to see their crowns, etc. I highly recommend! Watch out for all the gypsies around the area though that try to put",
          "This was an amazing experience! You have to pay twice as different groups run the Royal Chapel and the Cathedral, but it was only 5 Euro each. Very moving to see the burial place of the great Catholic Monarchs as well as their regalia and ancient artworks. The cathedral is one",
          "We did not really plan to see this, but when seeing the entrance (to the Royal Chapel) and no queues - decided to have a look. Was very impressed by the Royal Chapel - a dark austere place being the resting place of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Then more or less by",
          "Make this a priority place to visit. Fabulous art, architecture, statues and carvings. We went into the tomb and saw the burial site for Ferdinand and Isabella. Gives an insight into their world.",
          "called here after not being able to visit alhambra glad we did was awesome really big place takes time to go round",
          "Cheap, includes audio guide in different languages, full of history and beautiful to see both, inside and outside.",
          "The cathedral on Granada was built to proclaim the glory of the Catholic God and the design, scale and decoration of this building does exactly that. I've heard Renaissance Baroque described as the television of the 16th century, well this is definitely it. Don't miss it!",
          "Impressive. El Rey Fernando y la Reina Isabel La Cat\u00f3lica, financiaron los viajes de Colon Al Nuevo Mundo. The Catholics Kings were the only ones that believed in Col\u00f3n. This is a Sacred place. Col\u00f3n \"discover\" Puerto Rico in 1493. The Chappelle is beautiful, the tombs of the",
          "Spain and Europe have so many great Cathedrals that you get spoiled for choice\u2014 the Granada Cathedral is very impressive, but just below the top rung in terms of visual appeal. The Cathedral is the fourth largest in the world and is built in the Spanish Renaissance style",
          "Visited the Royal Chapel. Was amazed by some of its features , most notably the tomb and final resting place of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabelle of Spain. Amazed to view the actual caskets in which they lie. Many other noteworthy religious and historical icons on display.",
          "You are given headsets upon arrival to guide you through the tour. As it is an active place of worship, they ask that you not talk. The architecture and art of the building is truly stunning! It is well worth the visit and be sure to study the details before the headset hurries",
          "Worth every euro of entrance fee which is very reasonable. The building is stunning and the architecture and history amazing. Well worth a visit.",
          "The Royal Chapel is on a human scale and is the better for it. Everything about it small, very interesting, and this includes an excellent small Botticelli. We didn\u2019t see the main Cathedral but would recommend this adjacent Chapel for the reasons given.",
          "We first did the Royal Chapel with audio guides it a beautiful building outside and inside, with the tombs of Queen Isabel and King Ferdinard and plenty of their history, paintings, including Baroque altars. The Cathedral is connected to the chapel. Although you have to use",
          "My wife and I think that the Royal Chapel was a better experience than the Cathedral but both were very nice and \"must see\". (If I were to separate the two, the Chapel would get 5-stars and only 3 to the cathedral.) I personally thought that the audioguides were very good",
          "Great stop to see the sepulchers of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand and Phillip the Fair and Juana la Loca!! Especially enjoyed seeing the crown and scepter of the Queen! Just imagine a woman strong enough to rule Spain, stand against a male dominated society and commission",
          "Just a shame not to pop in even if more half an hour only. Get a recording headset and enjoy the cathedral and final resting place of Isabelle and Ferdinand. Well worth a visit. No photography or video allowed. No dress code.",
          "Be aware the rosemary sellers operate in this area as they will persistently shove them in your face. Entry to the chapel is 5\u20ac including an Audioguide, which is actually very informative, and not laden with mood music!. Absolutely no photos allowed. Although the chapel is for",
          "Totally in awe at this beautiful Cathedral. Amazing how it was built all those years ago. The Stained Glass Windows are stunning. They light up the whole Cathedral, using natural light.",

          "This gorgeous cathedral definitely deserves to be seen. We went without a tour guide and paid 8 euros each to get in and use the audio guide. We would have love to spend more time admiring the beautiful paintings and statues, but we only had 2 hours to spare. I wish we",
          "The cathedral itself is quite a sight and well worth a visit. The unique and most outstanding thing however is the chapel where the Catholic monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabel, are buried. Don't miss the Royal Chapel when you go.",
          "The cathedral is one of the biggest I. Spain and Europe. My girlfriend and I like to visit cathedrals whenever we visit a new city or country and we really like Granada\u2019s. While this is not the prettiest in Europe, it is rich in history and the audio guide makes the visit",
          "I always get absolutely astounded by the size and level of detail in these constructions. The cathedral is the burying site of 2 of the most important royals in history: the king and queen of Spain who financed the discovery of America and the recovering of southern Spain from",
          "The cathedral and royal chapel are a must....both have audio tours included in the price. Bonus is the collection of renaissance art!!! Worth the 2 hours",
          "This cathedral shows the power and influence the Catholic Church had on the kings of Spain. The architecture is unique as a Renascence church. It is huge and the audio guides is a must.",
          "Definitely must visit when in Granada. It is very impressive both interior and exterior. No queue and 5 Euro entrance fee. Audio guide is included with the entrance fee. Granada is not a beautiful city but the Cathedral is definitely the opposite. Surprised that dress code is",
          "good way to spend a few hours out of the heat. Not as good as Seville catherdal. Its a pity the local authorities do not do something about the local gypsies pushing rosemary sprig's at you and demanding money if you accept - a real turn off the area",
          "A place of cool reflection in a busy hot city The vast cathedral is wonderful explosions of Baroque and gold",
          "This is the best place to experience the grandeur of the Spanish Empire. The tombs of Isabella of Castille and Ferdinand of Aragon are luxurious and eye-catching. Interior is grand and impressive. Unfortunately no photo allowed inside.",
          "The cathedral is very impressive and provides hand wands for information at 9 stations. It's worth buying a \"Granada Ticket\" 40 euros which gives you entry into the Cathedral, Royal Chapel, bus rides and a ride on the Visitor Train which goes around the city. These tickets can",
          "A bit disapointing. We went early in the morning, before opening times, there were just a few people in the queue. As soon as it opened, we got in and received an audio guide included in the \u20ac5 ticket, but we were told we are not allowed to take pictures. We saw the tombs of",
          "After the conquest of Granada, Queen Isabella arranged for a Cathedral to be built on the site of an ancient mosque. It has impressive fa\u00e7ades and a stunning white interior with a grand altar and several chapels, the most interesting is the Chapel of Nuestra Senora de la",
          "Very impressive interior and exterior. A massive place with gold gilded altars, large organs, amazing paintings and sculptures.Final resting place of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Cost is 5 euros. Well worth a visit.",
          "One of the largest cathedrals in Spain. Was washed with lime (white) during times of disease and was so well liked they kept it. Giant columns, 2 large organs, incredible paintings, sculptures, detailed, gold gilded alters, and lots more.",
          "Dripping in gilt and decoration. And this church was supposed to symbolize charity and humility? Worth a visit to be awed by the unrelentingly over-the-top gold, silver, elaborate carvings and not a single inch of space left unadorned.",
          "It\u2019s well worth visiting both the Granada Cathedral & The Royal Chapel if you are in the city. We bought our tickets separately but I think you may be able to buy a combined tickets for the two which is slightly cheaper. Some days there were long queues for both visits but we",
          "The place is pretty massive. Very grand looking especially the organs. The audio guide which came with ticket was not good. As other people have pointed out, quite confusing when using it to look at the exhibits. I had to backtrack a few times when I realised I was in the wrong",
          "Two different pieces of Spanish history, yet connected by the fact that they are part of the cathedral though they have separate entrances (and separate entrance fees). While both are worth visiting, it works out relatively expensive and they should do a combined ticket for the",
          "My review of Malaga Cathedral mentioned that the audio guide was awful - well, this one was worse. The Malaga guide was long-winded and technical whereas this one was very difficult to follow. It directed you to various chapels and exhibits in the cathedral in no particular",
          "The Cathedral is the first Renaissance Cathedral in Spain and also the country's second largest. The main altar is ornate, fabulous d\u00e9cor and possibly unrivalled by any other high altar that we saw throughout our tour. The interior has various minor chapels, artwork, paintings",
          "The Cathedral is quite different from those of the other Andalusian cities as it is built in the Renaissance style. The interior is relatively plain except for some of the side chapels and the gorgeous main chapel which is brilliantly lit. Admission (5E) includes a free audio",
          "Inside Granada Cathedral is the Royal Chapel which is the is the final resting place of Queen Isabella & King Ferdinand of Spain. Entry cost was \u20ac5 each for our visit. We didn\u2019t ask for a audio guide. You will not need long to visit here but as with all Spanish history",
          "Steeped in history and tradition we see the the development of the deployment of primitive 14th century art to the renaissance. The crypts of the Isabella and Ferdinand and family are seen. The splendor and monies spent on this lavishness gave the artisans jobs and opportunities",
          "The Royal Chapel is the location of the tomb of Isabel and Fernando and her daughter etc, plus her crown, scepter etc in the little museum. This is what you want to see. There is a different entrance and you pay an entry fee just for the Royal Chapel, So combining these sites on",
          "Massive stone work, imposing church and a hefty entry fee. Nothing small scale here. Nice interior and connected to the Royal Chapel where Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand are buried. This is worth the Euros.",
          "After seeing many statues of Isabella and Ferdinand often with Christopher Columbus it was only fitting to see their final resting spot in the Royal Tombs. Moved by seeing Isabella's crown and very happy she and her husband funded and sent Christopher on his merry voyage. Also",
          "We love a church to look around when on hols but we\u2019re a bit underwhelmed I\u2019m afraid. Probably due to the audio guide which was frankly boring and delivered in quite a bizarre robotic style. No narrative so not engaging. Disappointing really. Compared to for example the Church",
          "Housed in the same structure, the Royal Chapel is exquisite while the Cathedral is grand. I would put them as number two place to visit in Granada after the Alhambra. There are entrance fees, but they are worth paying. Just as a note, there is a nice shop for spices, the name is",
          "Breathtaking cathedral, well worth a visit. The admission fee is 5 Euros and you are given a headset to listen to as you go around the cathedral.",
          "The Royal Chapel is The resting places for the Royal family Queen Isabella her husband and 3 children, they wanted a modest cript- later a beautiful chapel was built around it - note you cannot take photos inside",
          "You won't believe that in a small place like Granada that a cathedral like this exists. Take the audio tour and enjoy the many treasures inside. Then explore outside in all the little alleyways and shops in the marketplace. really a step back in time. I particularly enjoyed the",
          "This is a must visit. It ranks as one of the most impressive and beautiful Cathedrals I have visited. We had the Madrid Pass which included both the Cathedral and the Royal Chapel with audio guides.",
          "This cathedral is simply breathtaking and is easy to find in the very heart of the city. It has a mixture of Gothic and renaissance architecture. The dome is beautiful and the paintings and sculptures are truly magnificent. It cost just 5 Euro each to visit this wonderful",
          "When in Granada one of MUST to visit is the impressive Cathedral. Just in the center of the City, very easy to reach.",
          "Very beautiful and interesting building full of treasures. The free audioguide available in English was good",
          "Both attractions are as advertised, but I just didn't think they were that interesting. I wouldn't want to put anyone off, but if you're short of time and have an alternative attraction I'd go there.",
          "The Cathedral is worth a visit. The carved exterior facade is very impressive and beautiful. But as you enter the building - Wow! I was bowled over by the size, the dome and the various details. The huge interior columns are magnificent. The interior of the dome is painted",
          "The Royal Chapel holds some interest, being the \"final resting place\" of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castille. The Royal Chapel was built between 1506 and 1521. There are several sights to view, the most important of which are the Royal Tombs. The Main Altarpiece is",
          "We chose only to visit the Chapel and it was well worth the time and five euros. To see and listen to the commentary about this important time in Spanish history and about Queen Isabelle and King Ferdinand was enthralling to say the least. Would recommend taking the time to",
          "Wow what an experience so beautiful and so much history glad we had audio guide. Ano one going to Granada you must do the Cathedral and Alhambra.",
          "Speechless. Quite quite beautiful. Tip: If you are over 65 take your passport with you - there are always discounts for Senior Citizens.",
          "The carving and decoration is fantastic. This cathedral is also the buriel place of many spanish kings including Isabella anf Ferdinand.",
          "A truly great cathedral with so much to see and admire. The richness is beyond compare and a must-see!",
          "Great history lesion. Audioguide is excellent and well worth the money. This should be seen and experienced in Granada",
          "The Cathedral opens at 1030am and has a small entrance fee (I think it was 5 euros). They give you an audio phone for a tour and you can go around and see all the spots that are numbered and hear the history. The church is really ornate and beautiful. Probably plan to spend",
          "We found Granada Cathedral disappointing in comparison to many other cathedrals we have visited in Spain and France. There is not comparison with the fabulous cathedral in Burgos. Perhaps, it is because we prefer the Gothic cathedrals to this relatively modern Renaissance one.",
          "We stopped by to view this chapel and it was quite exquisite! The detailed work in it is lovely with many statues, carvings, and paintings.",
          "Spent some time wandering around the cathedral. Didn't bother with the audio guide as unless you want to know who painted every fresco, picture and stained glass window designer it was A bit too much I formation really. Quite a big queue to get in but moved fairly quickly.",
          "If you are going to Granada, do not miss a visit around this magnificent building. The Royal Chapel has a separate entrance and involves another ticket, however, it should not be missed! It is so beautiful with many amazing old paintings and sculptures.",
          "The cathedral is quite central and the tour is really well designed. You get in from the main entrance just like in any catholic place. You must pay 5\u20ac to continue from here but it includes a great audio guide that get you through the 9 steps of discovering the cathedral. You",
          "After about 10 days in Spain including visits to a number of ginormous churches, for me this one, while impressive in scale, lacks the drama and majesty of the older, gothic building. Don't get me wrong, this soaring renaissance building with whitewashed wall is still something",
          "Final resting place of Ferdinand and Isabella, this gothic chapel (really mausoleum) is interesting from an historical standpoint and has some beautiful art and artifacts including Isabella's crown and Ferdinand's sword. Pictures are not allowed out of reference to the dead.",
          "A very large cathedral. Towering pillars are an architectural delight. Lot of history here. Was the site of the Grand Mosque of Granada prior to the reconquista.",
          "This is the place where you can smell history, both the cathedral and royal chapels are a must go, beautiful, well conserved, they give you audio guides so you won't miss the history!",
          "Lovely cathedral with plenty of local history. The earpiece/ handset sets the story and the building is beyond beautiful. My only problem was that the commentary left me wondering which chapel or recess I was in\ud83d\ude33 Could do with slowing down a bit as there were a few people",
          "First visited 20 years ago, it was free at that time. Very little has changed in the Cathedral or the marvelous tombs. Not sure why it\u2019s necessary to pay for going in a church that is not that impressive.",
          "Granada has churches everywhere and of course the Cathedral is the largest. Excellent audio tour via a phone set in various languages. Also fab art pieces by the likes of Cano and access to the highly ornate and elegant sacristy. Royal Chapel has that regal splendour you expect.",
          "The cathedral is really huge in size and not so impressive in ornaments. The adjoining King's chapel is worthy to visit too. There are the tombs of the Spanish rulers Fernando and Isabella. The chapel is full of history.",
          "We did not have time to go inside but the exterior is very impressive. We were able to see the towers, along with the carvings and so on. A highlight was the door at the back that had the letters \"F\" and \"Y\" on - to represent Ferdinand and Isabella. Would like to visit inside on",
          "A beautiful cathedral!! Well worth the small charge to enter! If you\u2019re in Granada, does miss this! Stunning!",
          "We stay 3 days in Granada and had acommodation very close to cathedral. First time we entered (on right side of main entrance) were nothing special to see, we asked oursrlves what a usual cathedral. But...next day we went on free Granada city tour (included in ticket of train, 3",
          "After visiting the Alhambra in Granada, La Mezquita in Cordoba and the Royal Alcazar and La Catedral in Sevilla, the Royal Chapel and the Cathedral in Granada were rather underwhelming.",
          "There is an audio tour. It was hard to correlate what was being said to where I needed to look. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars. Listening to everything took a couple hours. It is amazingly huge inside with many alcoves, populated with many statues paintings and other",
          "As my partner and I are novice photographers, we decided to test our skills at the cathedral. We weren\u2019t disappointed as it provided plenty of material for us. Just watch out for the women attempting to sell you lucky charms or flowers.",
          "The cathedral is beautiful and worth the visit, but the audio tour is incredibly detailed, and I was never really sure what I was supposed to be looking at. I ended up ignoring it and just looking around instead.",
          "Place that merits a visit. Great story and architecture. Audio guides are too boring and long in description.",
          "A magnificent cathedral with striking tall pillars and a beautiful domed altar. The included audio guide added interest. Although you could not take photos or video inside the Royal Chapel, it was still fascinating to see the burial place of the Catholic Monarchs. The building",
          "Really enjoyed the Capilla Real(with tombs of Ferdinand and Isabella) and tiny museum with seriously impressive exhibits such as 15th century prayer book and crown used by Isabella",
          "Included in Grenada pass. Magnificient and come with audio guide. Nice painting and unbelievable murals.",
          "The Royal Chapel is on the back side of the cathedral and the cost is very inexpensive. About 5\u20ac for adults and 3,5\u20ac for students with an ID. An audio tour guide comes with the ticket and the audio tour takes about half an hour. The Royal Chapel is full of religious artwork and",
          "This is definitely a place to visit. You can visit part of the Cathedral for free, however the areas you get access to when you pay to visit are amazing. It only costs 4 Euros each and a audio guide is included. The audio guide is well written and spoken. The internal decoration",
          "It is said that Granada Cathedral was planned to be the largest in the world. Well, apparently it is not, but it is still huge. Though it is not as packed with artwork as St. Paul\u2019s in Vatican, it is still very impressive with many things to see. Due to long history of",
          "I enjoyed getting to see the inside of this cathedral, but I didn\u2019t love the audio guide. The audio gave a LOT of details & talked about almost every painting & window in the whole cathedral.",
          "If you stay in Granada, it is impossible to miss this gigantic cathedral. It is well worth to pay the fee to experience the history and architecture. Included in the fee are audio guide which l recommend.",
          "Dates back to 1523 and continued to be built over 200years encompassing many styles. The main chapel is inspired by the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. You get a multi lingual gadget that explains the history of the Cathedral...... well organised",
          "troubke with this is that after the Alhambra and the meaquita in Cordoba and the cathedral in Seville it seems a bit ordinary - but that's because the bar was set very high!",
          "Arriving at Granada airport and driving to the city by bus I was struck by the beauty of this place, and as soon as I had taken care of essentials, I set off on foot to find it. I was not disappointed. Situated in the heart of the city just off the main thoroughfare, it is hard",
          "This cathedral is massive so allow enough time to walk through it and see the royal chapel as well. We went at 6pm and it was not enough time. An audio guide is included In your admission but it isn\u2019t very good. Make sure to start at #1. They asked us to start at #6 and it",
          "Great building to see. Only the outside is already spectacular and really beautiful. Architectual Royal chapel is a must see. It is a pity it is not allowed to take pictures. Look out for pickpockets outside and the futuretellers with buxusleafs. Also great street entertainment",
          "The cathedral was spectacular & the details in each facade was intricate and beautiful. We used the Audio guides which were very detailed (perhaps a little too detailed for our liking), but learnt a lot about the cathedral. It wasn\u2019t very busy which allowed us to move around",
          "We only visited the Royal Chapel and it is very worthwhile. It cost 5 euro to get in and no pictures are allowed. The main altar is intricate and depicts the lives of John the Baptist and St John. In front of the altar are marble sculptures of Philip I and Joanna and",
          "What a stunning building ,and its amazing how it was built without todays modern equipment .The outside stone work is very ornate and imposing to say the least , then inside , well be prepared to be amazed ,its grand and huge .Sadly modern technology let me down and my camera",
          "This must be on your visit list and again the audio rental is great for getting the history of the Cathedral and surrounding area",
          "After visiting the Alhambra for a half day with our private guide Margarita Ortiz de Landazuri we headed to the Royal Chapel and Cathedral to visit the final resting place of Queen Izabella and King Ferdinand. What amazing foresight Queen Izabella had securing Columbus to",
          "The crypt with Ferdinand and isabells felt very powerful and special. Luckily it was very empty there when we went. Hard to feel spiritual with crowds.",
          "Well worth a visit for the history it contains. Let the audio guide talk you round all the different facets of the cathedral culminating in the tombs of Ferdinand and Isabella. Always lots going on around the perimeter of the building as well as the nearby squares.",
          "If you have 3-5 euros to spare, then you should pay to get inside. In the price there is a microphone included to listen to the history of the cathedral.. If you dont have money to spare, i personally think the cathedral is more impressive on the outside than inside. Ive seen",
          "From the moment of entering the cathedral the total tranquility is encompassing. The headsets supplied give an extremely concise and informative narrative of the various sections. An extremely beautiful and inspiring visit.",
          "Where king and queen Isabel got married. We were just able to get a peak of the cathedral. Be ready to pay 5eu pp and 3.5 for students. Check websites for free entrance on some days and time. You will need to make reservation for free entrance.",
          "Like most Spanish Cathedrals ,they are very impressive and the stone work is amazing , take time to look and be amazed to think all those years before mechanical equipment was around places like this were being built and carved by hand",
          "Another beautiful cathedral in Spain. Wonderful looming columns that reminded me of Jason and the Arganauts film. Huge doors, must be 30 feet tall. A very nice altar and stained glass windows. We didn't do the guided tour on this occasion but may do when we return in April",
          "I wasn\u2019t expecting such a grand building for a small sized city. Beautiful design inside and one of the most beautiful organs I\u2019ve seen in a cathedral.",
          "So much to see . Lots of walking so be prepared. Cobble stone streets so check out the weather for the days you are going to visit any sites",
          "The cathedrals in Spain are really worth visiting. You will pay 5 euro and get an audioguide. Thus is a very beautiful place full of important paintings and works.",
          "This cathedral is large and the audio tour is useful. Obviously based upon St Peter\u2019s in Rome. Not on the same scale though. If I\u2019m being honest it won\u2019t stay in my memory as the best I have ever seen.",
          "Don't miss The Royal Chapel Capella Real. a great historical site and gives a good history of not only the Chapel but the story of Isabella and Ferdinand. Their actual coffins of lead are part of the cathedral and you can see them, as well as many artifacts and part of",
          "Audio guide needs to be updated and edited. Difficult to follow, as the numbers were not in sequence and some areas were missing. Travelers need a simpler audio to follow. We are English speaking and we found it confusing.",
          "We visited the cathedral partly because we wanted to attend the Sunday service there. However, we like visiting churches too, and this one was certainly well worth seeing. It compares well with anything we\u2019ve seen in Rome or other European cities. The architecture, and its",
          "The cathedral and royal chapel are a definate must-see in Granada. The Cathedral and Chapel are separate. The Royal Chapel of Granada (Capilla Real de Granada)is the final resting place for the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile who completed",
          "The audio tour is full of interesting historical information and the displays are very interesting. It doesn't take very long to do the tour but is well worth the time spent. Admission is only 5 euros or is included if you get a granada card.",
          "Begun in 1500 just 8 years after the reconquest, the front and nave are pure Renaissance , astere and UN decorated. The high alter though is Baroque exuberance. Gold ,gold gold. A result of a raid on the new world.",
          "After seeing so many cathedrals, mosques and basilicas, this one does seem to go further down the list. But what you can see of this place it is magnificent architecture and worth a visit.",
          "The most beautiful take the walk and listen tour see the crypt of queen Isabel and Ferdinand amazing \ud83d\ude09 They are famous painting done in the 1600 Hugh organs and gold guilt and carerra marble not to be missed",
          "In my opinion this is a must see as well when visiting Granada. Not sure what we have paid to come in but the audio guide was included.",
          "Nice place to escape the heat and fill up a gap in your sightseeing schedule. In the centre of town so you're sure to pass by more than once. Not particularly religious but appreciated the architecture and the main alter. Wouldn't say it is a must, but likewise it isn't unworthy",
          "It is a must to see on your trip in Granada. The entry fee is 5 euro but its worth this price.Tge ticket including the a audioguide.",
          "We visited the church and pay for the ticket to go inside, the church looks ok to me cause we have just visited the church in Sevilla, compared between the two, I like Sevilla one better cause the construction and size was more impressed to me, but this church is still worth to",
          "It's a cathedral. A nice one, and immense, but only partially accessible inside. So it looks a lot bigger and more impressive on the outside than it does inside. Sure, it's a nice cathedral, with an impressively opulent altar wall, but imho it's a bit overrated. I've probably",
          "Beautiful and magnificent cathedral. Definite visit when you are Granada. Should read the history of the cathedral before the visit.",
          "The Royal Chapel has a wonderful collection of images and paintings as well as holy garments. Besides it has the tombs of Isabel the Castella and her husband Fernan de Aragon. They ordered the costruction of the chapel in order to be buried there. It is a visit with audio guide.",
          "Not an attraction you have to see in Granada. But if you are there, take the ten minutes to have a look.",
          "A magnificent setting. I attended mass here but you can visit without attending a religious service. It is a wonderful space with magnificent artefacts and paintings. Quite awe inspiring. So much history. A quiet oasis in the middle of the busy city.",
          "The Cathedral is a majestic structure--so much to see and all of it spectacular. On the other side is the 16th century Royal Chapel housing the remains of Ferdinand III and Queen Isabella. The crypt is worth the entrance money alone.",
          "This smallish Chapel is actually part of the main cathedral, but accessed by its own separate entrance (& another entrance fee!). To me much preferable to the massive cathedral. However I can't for the life of me see why there is a rigid ban - strictly enforced - on taking",
          "A very odd mix between very plain white walls and really OTT little side chapels. Such extreme over decoration somehow does not fit with the 21st century. The cathedral is very hemmed in by more recent buildings. More attractive to my eyes is the Royal Chapel, part of the",
          "Beautiful building from the outside but once inside cold and bare. Worth a look if you have an all included ticket but would not pay separately to visit",
          "I'd suggest getting the audio tour if you want to learn more about what you are looking at! This is the burial place of Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand.",
          "Cathedral is impressive and well worth seeing (you get a free audio guide with your admission ticket). However - Cathedral altar aside which is stunning - I was more impressed by the Capilla Real...again free audio guide included in admission - very thorough. I got a real sense",
          "While wandering through the Albaicin see the Cathedral. I wasn\u2019t able to go in but took some great pics outside and loved the little shops along the alleyways. My friend went in a different day and says it\u2019s amazing inside so hopefully you can have that experience!",
          "Worth a visit if you are in the city. Audio guide of the chapel is good. Interesting facade of the cathedral. Very photogenic",
          "I came to the chapel to see the tomb of the Catholic Kings of Spain, with my Spanish boyfriend. We both love history and so had to see this while in Granada. Unfortunately the cathedral was closing when we left, but we spent lots of time wandering around the chapel and tomb.",
          "The Cathedral is very big: big stones, big walls, big statues. Inside is incredible, with big and think columns.",
          "The cathedral is bright and white with quite understated decor and beautiful light flooding through the high windows. Informative audiotour. Chapel Royal full of history including the lead coffins of the Catholic monarchs.",
          "I have been in many Cathedrals and this might possibly be the most beautiful and amazing one. This rivals the Vatican!",
          "The Cathedral is really worth a visit for the chapels, alter as well as the art and treasury collection.",
          "For \u20ac 5,00 you wil be at least one hour busy seeing the blingbling inside this cathedral. It shows how rich the spain was at that time by taking all the gold from the south america. It's very big church with a lot of chapels. The organs are beautiful.",
          "This is a peaceful haven from the bustle of Granada. There are beautiful paintings and stain glass inside. As well as wonderful sculptures. Definitely pop your head inside the cathedral for a look.",
          "As many cathedrals in the catholic world this one is again a splendid example of how one can express the faith and how this looks if you have enough money to do so. You can hardly have a good outside view but the inside is spectacular enough and I strongly recommend using the",
          "The towering arched interior is quite majestic. The audio guide is helpful although it provides an overload of information. Magnificent altarpiece. The Royal Chapel is the burial place of Isabel and Ferdinand, their massive marble tomb along with that of their daughter Joanna",
          "Both are very impressive. The Spanish glory. These places are separately charged and entered. The royal chapel is a no photo place. Pretty strange. The cathedral is large, wonderfully decorated and a little bit overwhelming. A good lesson of history.",
          "Catedral de Granada is well worth a visit and is only 5 Euros for which you get a detailed audio guide. Imposing facade overlooks a small square. Difficult to appreciate the entirety of the exterior as its surrounded by buildings. Inside is dark with impressive nave and alter",
          "This is a truly beautifully ornate building which holds the crypts of Ferdinand and Isabella plus Philip the first and his supposedly mad wife. Very worthwhile visiting for people interested in either architecture or history.",
          "Beautiful cathedral and very easy to access. No tickets needed, which makes it all the more accessible.",
          "This must be one of the most impressive cathedrals I've seen in my life. Free audioguides with good information and beautiful architecture. I loved the two organs. The only issue I had with this cathedral was the enormous anti abortion poster saying that women who have had",
          "One of the most spectacular cathedrals we have visited in Spain! 5\u20ac for pensioners to enter with an excellent audio guide. The two organs are spectacular! Well-worth a visit!",
          "This is another beautiful church in Spain All start looking alike as do the pictures but did enjoy seeing the carvings",
          "The most impressive place is the crypt below the tomb. In it are five plain lead coffins two of which contain the remains of a pair of the greatest monarchs in the history of Europe. Isabella and Ferdinand finally defeated and expelled the Moors from Spain and also financed",
          "We did not go inside the Cathedral, but instead visited the Royal Chapel (please note it has a different entrance and ticket office). The Chapel contains the tomb of King Ferdinand and Queen Ysabel. It's a smaller space, yet grand in its own way. Photos not allowed inside.",
          "One would think that having seen the cathedral in Seville, would have cured us from seeing anymore splendor, but it so happened it was raining, so we went in. This cathedral was not as impressive as the one in Seville, but it can hold it's own. It's the 2nd largest in Spain and",
          "A must see if you are in Granada specially the Royal Chapel, for its links to catholic monarchs and Spanish history as their marriage marked the foundation of the current Spain. And it is a beautiful monument too.",
          "If you have any interest at all in Spanish history, then this Cathedral is a must! Queen Isabel and King Ferdinand lie burried here beneath their likenesses in statue. Look carefully and you may get a clear hint as to which one really had the brains and the power!",
          "Nice visit for the time in Granada, especially the Royal Chapel. Go toward the end of the day when the lines are short.",
          "Sadly the exterior was covered in scaffolding in several areas but what was on display was an impressive structure ! But as I walked up to the door an official stopped me & another lady from entering ? My Spanish being non existent , no English version was offered , the lady",
          "Cathedral and Royal Chapel have separate entrances and admission charges. Cathedral is impressive from the outside although difficult to appreciate as its obscured by buildings. The Royal Chapel has the coffins of royals Ferdinand and Isabella who liberated Granada and Spain",
          "A real breath of fresh air after visiting so many beautiful but enormously over adorned cathedrals and churches. Simple , classics focused and beautiful. If you are a bit over it all give it one more go, it is stunningly simple and beautiful",
          "I loved the Cathedral, we attended a guided tour. Super interesting history and the tombs were amazing! Loved the historical significance. However much of the outside of the Cathedral is under construction.",
          "We visited here because of history and design and it proved worth it. Busy with tourists so be patient and take your time to look around and enjoy each moment. Take your cameras and enjoy the surroundings too lots to see do and loads of places to eat and drink",
          "Well worth seeing. Thoroughly enjoyed visit. Fantastic architecture on a massive scale. Audio guide is a bit confusing.",
          "This is an impressive building, as you'd expect, certainly worth seeing. I think it was \u20ac5 entrance fee and 4 or 5 euros for the royal chapel",
          "Impressive cathedral! The cross shape of the different naves as well as the circular shape around the altar makes for a truly remarkable church. Entrance is cheap and comes with a free (and somewhat lengthy) audio guide.",
          "FYI the cathedral and chapel, while technically connected, are entered from 2 different locations and require separate \u20ac5 (regular) admission passes. The cathedral and chapel are beautiful historic sites that are definitely worth the visit, especially if you have any interest",
          "Very calm visit. Don\u2019t miss the model of the cathedral when you first come in to orientate yourself.",
          "The Cathedral itself is pretty well explained by its facade - it looks like a fortress more than a church. And that was the statement the builders and city fathers wanted to communicate. A guide told me that there was much better ground on which to build this cathedral perhaps",
          "You can visit part of the Cathedral for free, however the jewel in the crown is the areas you get access to when you pay to visit. It only costs 4 Euros each and an audio guide is included. The audio guide was well written and spoken. The internal decoration of the Cathedral is",
          "Amazing, that's the best word to describe this holy place. From its huge proportions to the fine details in the statues, it is all worth a closer look.",
          "very impressive cathedral, one of the largest in Europe. Immense columns, a bit reminding of St Peter's in Rome with the simple white reflecting the light from outside. The twin organs stand out, unfortunately not being played while we were there.",
          "We only visited the cathedral but the chapel looks superb from outside, we just didn\u2019t have enough time. I\u2019d recommend an hour to view the cathedral as you\u2019re given a personal device so you can listen to a recording of each section, in your own language, as you wander around",
          "Well preserved and beautiful old church with a lot to see and experience. Easily found and toured, it has special alters and sites that will amaze visitors,",
          "The Capilla Real or Royal Chapel is adjacent to the Catedral and is the place where the Catholic Monarchs (King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella), their daughter Joanna the Mad and her husband Philip the Handsome are buried. No photos or videos are allowed inside and the entry is",
          "Nice church, but does not justify the price of 5 Euro each, even if this includes the audio, which is boring and ultra-christian",
          "The Catedral has an imposing facade with an open square boxed by cafes and shops and in the surrounding lanes. Entry is \u20ac5 per person and the audio guides are free. It\u2019s magnificent inside and the altar is beautiful and ornate. You can sit on one of the numerous pews while",
          "Entrance is expensive because it includes an audio guide. The commentary, at least the english version, was fulsome to say the least.",
          "Great medieval architecture. One from the most meaning places in medieval and reinesance in Europe. Wooden medieval sculptures re great",
          "A must see if visiting granada. Extremely central. A fair fee charged which includes audio guide full of information. Very nice",
          "This cathedral was within walking distance of our hotel, the Eurostar Gran Via. The cathedral is one of the major tourist sites to visit in Granada and is well worth the 5 Euro fee per individual to visit. The photographs elaborate on the grandeur of this grand facility.",
          "Not to easy to find in the urban sprawl - keep an eye on the tourist signs.entry 10 euros for adults. Full of natural light - great for photography. Well worth an hour or two and it is surrounded by Plazas with shops cafes bars and restaurants. Great for tapas and people watching",
          "If it were not for the audio guide that they give you as included in the ticket probably you would spend only few minutes there. Besides the audio guide is really poor in details. Nice cathedral but nothing extraordinary neither memorable. For sure you will find more amazing",
          "i went to the cathedral because i usually buy a little something from the countries i visit. the cathedral is huge and when you go in 5 euros they hand you a hand set to give you the history of the place and were to go on the tour. you could spend hours inside there is so much",
          "Included in the Granada card. Royal Chapel is a little more interesting if you are time limited. Free audio guide was not all that good.",
          "Costs 5\u20ac entrance which includes an audio handset. Goes on a bit but is worthwhile. The organs are magnificent, and with several thousand pipes it is an amazing sight. The alter and everything around and about it is amazing. Always makes me think of the poor parishioners that",
          "We were too late purchasing Alhambra tickets and bought Granada passes to get in to the Palace. Since this ticket also included admission to both the Cathedral and the Chapel (2 separate tickets). I would not normally visit places like these but I am glad I did. What was most",
          "I\u2019ve seen a lot of European churches but this one was a little different especially since it had Isabella and Ferdinand\u2019s tombs. It was really quite spectacular and I recommend the audio guide",
          "The cathedral is already great as it's so beautiful and the royal chapel is just unbelievable. You can't help but admire the great history of Spain and you definitely get an hint why Spain's influence is stll so great.",
          "The cathedral, by it's sheer size is breath taking. The opulence of the baroque architecture is stunning and worth the 5euro entrance fee. I found the Royal Chapel to be a bit of an anti climax though, also 5euro entrance fee.",
          "This building is up there with some of the most stunning i've ever seen. I happened upon the cathedral on a walk looking for lunch. In the little streets of Granada it's easy to bypass such beauties. However this really stood out and took my breathe away! Worth a visit",
          "Worth turning up when the cathedral opens at 10am to beat the crowds. Cathedral is stunning; audio tour is good although I was suffering a little from information overload by the end. Royal Chapel is slightly less impressive & we were definitely crammed too full of information",
          "You're asked contributed 5 euros each for the upkeep of the building but for this you have access to an info-phone for your duration that explains various aspects of the cathedral. Not one of the best cathedrals I've been in but definitely worth a look",
          "One of the more impressive churches I have visited. The huge double organ was impressive. Seeing the tombs of Ferdinand and Isabella was very cool. The audio provided with the 5\u20ac admission to the church was extremely informative! Excellent stop!",
          "Well worth visiting it if you love architecture otherwise give it a miss. Cn be queues at busy times of the day.",
          "The Cathedral is not worth your time, when the beautiful Basilica is so close. The cathedral doesn't allow cameras and costs more. Not nearly as beautiful and other Spanish churches. I was very disappointed.",
          "This is a very large, open, bright church. The main altar is impressive, but the side chapels, with their altars and paintings, were even more so. Entry to the Royal Chapel is \u20ac5 and that includes a very good AudioGuide. You will leave understanding the history of the catholic",
          "Wow! We came out during the pouring rain to see the cathedral today and it was stunning! Well worth the \u20ac5 to get in. We didn't manage to listen to the audio guide much as the kids didn't want to stop for long but I imagine it's well worth it! It is absolutely beautiful!",
          "A rather plain interior to some in Spain but with many side chapels, and many painting, beautiful organ. I used the audio guild this was useful.However, a visit to the Basilica of San Juan de Dios should NOT BE MIST.",
          "Only thing is that you cannot take pictures in side but it definitely worth a visit get for the history and to see it the only picture are from the out side",
          "The cathedral is very nice as most grand cathedrals of Europe but the Royal Chapel next door is the place to be for those who enjoy history the most. This is where Isabella I & Ferdinand II, the two Spanish monarchs who got credit for expelling the last Moors from the Iberian",
          "The interior of this building is beautiful. For 10 euros (couple) you can go inside and take an audio tour, which is very informative. The paintings, sculptures and history is amazing. They do ask you to be quiet in the cathedral so I would not recommend this if you have small",
          "I took a Granada Card for three which has exclusive entrance to both Cathedral and Royal Chapel along with Alhambra and few other attractions. Have an audio guide along with you to understand the background and history related to it. Dont forget to see the crypt inside the",
          "Very impressive. Good audio. Informative. Can do at your own pace. Enjoyed more than some of the larger cathedrals. Short line that moved quickly.",
          "Absolutely a must to stop in and take a look. The audio tour lasts about 35-40 minutes and walks you through the cathedral at a perfect pace. The altar is magnificent to see even if you want to skip the rest.",
          "Great Cathedral, absolutely worth it with the audio guide . Entrance cost 5 euros . Splendid stained glass windows",
          "Royal Chapel really interesting and we had Audio Guide which was really good and worth having. Stopping and listening to the history of the chapel.",
          "Don\u2019t miss this attraction. You can\u2019t take photos in here, but just soak of the view of the cathedral and the tombs. It was a great place to visit.",
          "This is an amazing place to visit. It is a must. Included in the entry price, you are given headphones and it gives informative information as you follow the routes around the cathedral. Beautiful rose windows. A must.",
          "Burial place of Isabella and Ferdinand. Great audio tour of the Royal Chapel. Make sure you have both of these locations on your Granada list",
          "Very Informative visit to the cathedral and Royal Chapel of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. The audio guides give you much his background of the Royal Chapel.",
          "We really enjoyed the cathedral, not least of all because our ten and six year old kids were totally engrossed in the kids' audio guide. The cathedral is large and filled with light, rather than hordes of people, and although the audio tour is heavily focussed on religious",
          "Even if from the outside it is difficult to see the total monument when you are inside you can feel the grandeur. I recommend to use the remotes they give you to understand the place but it can be done without.",
          "The cathedral, with its colossally beautiful white columns and baroque adornments, is truly one of the most magnificent cathedrals in the world. The light streams abundantly through the many perfectly situated windows. The paintings and sculptures throughout are spectacular,",
          "The audio guide is essential, but can be pretty boring in places as there is too much information concerning famous Spanish architects and painters, maybe I'm just not educated enough! I preferred the Royal Chapel and seeing the sarcophagus of Isabel and Ferdinand was the",
          "A stunning example of a white Gothic Cathedral and well worth the visit. I loved that music was being played, adding to the atmosphere. Take you time to visit the side chapels.",
          "I'd suggest that you include these two attractions as \"must see\" items on your visit to Granada. Our Rick Steve's book gave enough info and background to greatly enhance our visits here.",
          "This I believe is the highlight of Granada. Well worth vis\u00ecting. Recommend visiting the tombs nearby which is a separate ticket and price. The streets around the cathedral are buzzing and interesting",
          "Well worth it. We skipped the cathedral...how many do you need to see in Europe but the chapel is much more intimate. And quiet because everyone else was on an audio guide. And no photos so you can actually look at the space and contemplate the history. Worth spending time on",
          "The small entrance fee includes an audio guide. Although interesting, the guide was possibly a little too detailed. Can be done in 30 mins unless you take more of a religious view. Impressive building.",
          "The Cathedral is well worth a visit. The tour costs a few Euros and comes with a personal handset to guide you around. Very enjoyable and beautiful",
          "One of the largest Cathedrals in Europe and certainly one of the most splendid. The detail inside is breathtaking, a place not to be missed",
          "Not so impressive. Have seen much more majestic cathedrals in andalusia (seville caathedral, cordoba)",
          "The chapel was outstanding with great artwork and a pretty good audioguide. I found the audioguide for the chapel to be okay but overly detailed. This is often a problem: there is so much history and information that COULD be presented, and the producers have to decide where to",
          "We strolled around the outside of this building to admire the Architecture before going inside. The interior was beautiful and the colours amazing. A place to visit when in Granada",
          "A beautiful building with lots of history. \u20ac5 entrance which includes an excellent audio guide. The construction and decor is phenomenal. On the downside, I hate the electric \"visitor\" candles that have obviously replaced proper candles that you can light for a loved one :0(",
          "Loved this Cathedral we went in the morning and was so impressed - you are asked to keep quiet which makes for a very relaxing experience",
          "We only visited the Royal Chapel (not Cathedral) - burial place of Ferdinand & Isabella - beautiful building and very imposing tombs. The audio guide for the chapel was excellent - one of the best I've experienced, as I usually dislike these, very clear and good information.",
          "Well worth the 5 euros entrance fee. The free audio tour is informative if a little quick on its delivery- you can repeat the info.m",
          "For \u20ac5 euros you are given a headphone set to wander around the cathedral. We all seemed to lose section 6 initially but lots to see. Even those of us who weren't too interested in churches couldn't fail to be impressed.",
          "Not as spectacular as the Cathedral in Seville, but well worth a visit. Entry cost is only 5 euros and you get a free audio guide with lots of historical information on. We enjoyed our visit.",
          "Although the interior is spectacular the audio guide (a literal translation from the Spanish) doesn't do it justice. It's quite difficult to follow and the sequence of locations it takes you to around the cathedral is not in an obvious order. Definitely worth a visit but with a",
          "It is easy to miss the Royal Chapel which has a separate entrance to the cathedral around the side. The cathedral has many fine paintings, statues and other works of art. Do not miss the chapel this has the tombs of the King Charles and Queen Isabella, a wonderful building",
          "Great cathedral and chapel. Get the free audio tour included with the ticket so you know what you are looking at. I got much more out of the visit with it.",

          "One of the best cathedrals I've been in. The natural light inside is amazing lighting the fantastic golden alter. The audio system is not great as in its out of order. Best to find the numbers around the cathedrel and just click the number rather that follow the guide. Don't",
          "Three of us visited this beautiful Cathedral. They provide an audio tour. Upon entering, there is a room that can be described as a museum. There were vestments and other religious items on display. No photography is allowed in this room. The church itself is huge. The altar",
          "This cathedral is in the middle of the hustle and bustle, it was not easy to find the entrance but well worth a visit ! It was 5E entry which included the free audioguide - brilliantly done at a leisurely pace, very informative and we all enjoyed it. It was nice to stop and",
          "Fabulous cathedral, price of admission includes audio guide, the architecture and history are fascinating. When groups arrived it got quite busy but they seemed to get whisked through very quickly so an independent visit is much better. The Royal chapel is a separate entrance",
          "This church is truly gorgeous and incredibly big. Can't miss it. The facade is impressive. The Catholic Kings and Queen built a cathedral of tremendous beauty. Pictures don't do this place any justice. You need to see it to believe it. I hope it gets much use. Like many",
          "So, are you into churches? If so you might like it otherwise paying five euros to go to church might seem a bit steep. Although that gives you an audio thing in your language. Must admit though that the audio was so boring and that the English guy doing it spoke so poorly it was",
          "...somehow it was a bit soulless. I didn't visit on a Sunday when they have services, so perhaps that's unfair. It is huge with ornate side chapels and central altar. For my part, this would not be a must-see for Granada but could be admired sufficiently from the outside.",
          "Both these sites are fabulous. With your ticket you get an audio guide which makes the visits very informative. Fabulous pieces to see.",
          "The Royal Chapel and Cathedral are 2 separate visits . Both chargeable at 5 euros. I did feel however that both of the visits were excellent value as audio guides were provided at each visit. These provided much needed detail about the history and artefacts in each attraction.",
          "For the 10 euros that we paid we were able to enjoy an incredible visual Feast of architecture and history. We went midday and they were very few people for us to contend with. We were offered phone devices which would give us English narratives of some of the art and",
          "We visited the Cathedral and Royal Chapel using the Granada Card. When visiting both buildings we were given a free audio guide. The Cathedral's audio guide was a little bit too detailed for us, so we decided to take in the beautiful interior without it. However, in the Royal",

          "With your admission ticket you get an audio guide which is extensive and very informative. It takes you everywhere around the cathedral and the chapel. The cathedral houses some amazing art work which is worth seeing. Should not be missed. Spend some time in there and make sure",
          "Right in the center of Granada - this is a must see. For about 5 Euros you get a audio guided tour. Tour lasts about 45 minutes or so. I can recommend highly.",

          "Beautiful cathedral - stunning altar and organs. Calm atmosphere , even with the multitude of visitors - we are asked to be quiet and most people observe this practice. Audio guide assist well with the many different aspects of this building and enables a firmer understating",
          "Good value for money and interesting for those who are not paticularly religious. The audio guide was very informative.",
          "Very informative Easy to find and interesting architecture nearby Audio guides are very useful and easy to follow",
          "I thought it was nicer, but the other churches are much better. I forced to myself to go in, because it is famous, but there are more beautiful churches in Granada. However, if you see outside in the early morning, it was a holy picture.",
          "It is a must do in Granada. The Royal Chapel hosted the mausoleum of the Reyes Cat\u00f3licos ( Isabel de Castilla y Fernando de Aragon). The visit includes an audio guide which gives you a details explanation of all that is in there.",
          "It is a good cathedral nothing like a Roman or Florentine masterpiece but good. The recorded tour you had to buy upon entry is however very very catholic biased. I understand it is a catholic cathedral, but it claims there was no Christianity in Granada before the \"reconquista\"",
          "The massive cathedral and Royal Chapel are examples of Royal ostentation with a vast array of bloody statues and gilding. I think that it certainly needs to be seen in order to get a feel for the importance and impact of Isabella and Ferdinand. The audio guide came at no",
          "This experience was amazing with so much to see and how beautiful it all was. The dictator phones were really helpful as there's so much to take in but the length of the dialogue can be a bit long and pitch too slow. Still a must see though.",
          "Beautiful church with graves of Isabel and Ferdinand (Felipe and Juana, too!) and their tombs below. The collection of Flemish painting (Memling and more) are also fantastic.",
          "This is a must see, we had breakfast in Ramblas cafe in the square behind the cathedral (very good) & then went for a visit. Took about 1-1.5 hours to see round, you get an audio guide which is really useful. You won't believe how beautiful this place is, the more you look at it",
          "Nice building. Plenty of interesting shops and cafe around it. The local food market at St Agustin is very near to you can combine your visit. Great tourist information office next to the building too.",
          "We visited both parts at 5 euros each. Very peaceful and they allow photos in the Cathedral but not the chapel.",
          "The Cathedral was extremely impressive. The Art and paintings were a must see. The audio tour went on too long and preached at times.",
          "We didn't actually do in the church, but enjoyed sitting outside a restaurant in the courtyard and sight seeing. A great place to take a little break and enjoy the massive visage of this building.",
          "The cathedral is beautiful and finely decorated, with many altars dating from the XVI century. At the entrance you will be provided with a free audioguide which will help you to discover the history of this amazing place. The Royal Chapel, where the Catholics Kings are buried,",
          "The Granada Cathedral was a little pricey for a family of six and I felt a little out of pocket by the experience. I guess the timing did not help being mid afternoon with the kids feeling tired and totally disengaged with the place. The Cathedral is grand and impressive as a",
          "Wow, an amazing place. So Spanish, so christian, so catholic, so much gold! Visiting this place is like being in a time machine. A really poignant visit as the crypt is stunning. A must in Granada!",
          "Wholeheartedly recommend these to anyone with an interest in history/the catholic monarchs. The audio guide really makes the visit and is very interesting and not too heavy going. Offers a welcome break from the summer sun whilst taking in the culture of Granada. No need to",
          "Went hear on the off chance - cost 5\u20ac to get in - free audio tour of the history of this neo classical designed cathedral- very interning facts with the tour. Would recommend",
          "We stumbled across this cathedral. Audio tour included in entry fee. Very interesting in regards to Spanish history",
          "Situated in the middle of the City the Cathedral is probably worth a visit. A typically high Catholic Church there are some interesting architectural features.",
          "My wife and I visited the cathedral near the end of February. Overall, we had a nice experience here. It's not the largest cathedral I have visited but we spent just over an hour there taking pictures. The only thing I would say is be wary of the gypsies/roma that hang around",

        "wiki": "Granada ( gr\u0259-NAH-d\u0259, Spanish: [\u0261\u027ea\u02c8na\u00f0a]) , locally [\u0261\u027ea\u02c8na] is the capital city of the province of Granada, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. Granada is located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the confluence of four rivers, the Darro, the Genil, the Monachil and the Beiro. It sits at an average elevation of 738 m (2,421 ft) above sea level, yet is only one hour by car from the Mediterranean coast, the Costa Tropical. Nearby is the Sierra Nevada Ski Station, where the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 were held.\nIn the 2005 national census, the population of the city of Granada proper was 236,982, and the population of the entire urban area was estimated to be 472,638, ranking as the 13th-largest urban area of Spain. About 3.3% of the population did not hold Spanish citizenship, the largest number of these people (31%; or 1% of the total population) coming from South America. Its nearest airport is Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca Granada-Ja\u00e9n Airport.\nThe Alhambra, an Arab citadel and palace, is located in Granada. It is the most renowned building of the Islamic historical legacy with its many cultural attractions and architectural elements that make Granada a popular destination among the tourist cities of Spain. The Almohad influence on architecture is also preserved in the Granada neighborhood called the Albaic\u00edn with its fine examples of Moorish and Morisco construction.  Granada is also well-known within Spain for the University of Granada which has an estimated 82,000 students spread over five different campuses in the city.  The pomegranate (in Spanish, granada) is the heraldic device of Granada.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Umayyad history ===\n\nThe region surrounding what today is Granada has been populated since at least 5500 BC and experienced Roman and Visigothic influences. The most ancient ruins found in the city belong to an Iberian oppidum called Ilturir, in the region known as Bastetania. This oppidum eventually changed its name to Iliberri, and after the Roman conquest of Iberia, to Municipium Florentinum Iliberitanum.\n\n\n=== Founding and early history ===\n\nThe Umayyad conquest of Hispania, starting in AD 711, brought large parts of the Iberian Peninsula under Moorish control and established al-Andalus. Granada's historical name in the Arabic language was \u063a\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0629 (\u0120arn\u0101\u1e6dah). The word G\u00e1rnata (or Karnatah) possibly means \"hill of strangers\". Because the city was situated on a low plain and, as a result, difficult to protect from attacks, the ruler decided to transfer his residence to the higher situated area of G\u00e1rnata. According to Arabic sources Ilbira (Elvira) was razed during Fitna of al-Andalus, afterwards it was not restored at its previous place and instead Garnata, which was a Jewish ghetto before, replaced it as the main city. In a short time this town was transformed into one of the most important cities of al-Andalus.In the early 11th century, after the collapse of the Umayyad Caliphate, the Berber Zawi ben Ziri established an independent kingdom for himself, the Taifa of Granada. His surviving memoirs \u2013 the only ones for the Spanish \"Middle Ages\" \u2013 provide considerable detail for this brief period. The Zirid Taifa of Granada was a Jewish state in all but name; the Muslim king is looked upon as a mainly symbolic figurehead. It was the center of Jewish Sephardi culture and scholarship.\n\nEarly Arabic writers repeatedly called it \"Garnata al-Yahud\" (Granada of the Jews).... Granada was in the eleventh century the center of Sephardic civilization at its peak, and from 1027 until 1066 Granada was a powerful Jewish state. Jews did not hold the foreigner (dhimmi) status typical of Islamic rule. Samuel ibn Nagrilla, recognized by Sephardic Jews everywhere as the quasi-political ha-Nagid ('The Prince'), was king in all but name. As vizier he made policy and\u2014much more unusual\u2014led the army.... It is said that Samuel's strengthening and fortification of Granada was what permitted it, later, to survive as the last Islamic state in the Iberian peninsula.\nAll of the greatest figures of eleventh-century Hispano-Jewish culture are associated with Granada. Moses Ibn Ezra was from Granada; on his invitation Judah ha-Levi spent several years there as his guest. Ibn Gabirol\u2019s patrons and hosts were the Jewish viziers of Granada, Samuel ha-Nagid and his son Joseph.\nWhen Joseph took over after his father's death, he proved to lack his father's diplomacy, bringing on the 1066 Granada massacre, which ended the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain.\nBy the end of the 11th century, the city had spread across the Darro to reach the hill of the future Alhambra, and included the Albaic\u00edn neighborhood (now a World Heritage site). The Almoravids ruled Granada from 1090 and the Almohad dynasty from 1166.\n\n\n=== Nasrid dynasty\u2014Emirate of Granada ===\n\nIn 1228, with the departure of the Almohad prince Idris al-Ma'mun, who left Iberia to take the Almohad leadership, the ambitious Ibn al-Ahmar established the last and longest reigning Muslim dynasty in the Iberian peninsula, the Nasrids. With the Reconquista in full swing after the conquest of C\u00f3rdoba in 1236, the Nasrids aligned themselves with Fernando III of Castile, officially becoming the Emirate of Granada in 1238. Most historians agree that Granada became a tributary state to the Kingdom of Castile from that year, although this was often interrupted by wars between the two states. It provided connections with Muslim and Arab trade centers, particularly for gold from sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb, and exported silk and dried fruits produced in the area. The Nasrids also supplied troops from the Emirate and mercenaries from North Africa for service to Castile.\nIbn Battuta, a famous traveller and an authentic historian, visited the Kingdom of Granada in 1350. He described it as a powerful and self-sufficient kingdom in its own right, although frequently embroiled in skirmishes with the Kingdom of Castile. In his journal, Ibn Battuta called Granada the \"metropolis of Andalusia and the bride of its cities.\"During the Moor rule, Granada was a city with adherents to many religions and ethnicities (Arabs, Berbers, Christians and Jews) who lived in separate quarters. During this Nasrid period there were 137 Muslim mosques in the Medina (city) of Granada.\n\n\n=== Reconquista and the 16th century ===\n\nOn January 2, 1492, the last Muslim ruler in Iberia, Emir Muhammad XII of Granada, known as \"Boabdil\" to the Spanish, surrendered complete control of the Emirate of Granada to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, Los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos (\"the Catholic Monarchs\"), after the last battle of the Granada War.\nThe 1492 surrender of the Kingdom of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs is one of the most significant events in Granada's history as it marks the completion of the Reconquista. The terms of the surrender, expressed in the Alhambra Decree treaty, explicitly allowed the city's Muslim inhabitants, known as Mud\u00e9jars, to continue unmolested in the practice of their faith and customs. By 1499, however, Cardinal Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros grew frustrated with the slow pace of the efforts of the first archbishop of Granada, Hernando de Talavera, to convert non-Christians to Christianity and undertook a program of forced Christian baptisms, creating the Converso (convert) class for Muslims and Jews. Cisneros's new tactics, which were a direct violation of the terms of the treaty, provoked the Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1499\u20131501) centered in the rural Alpujarras region southwest of the city.\nResponding to the rebellion of 1501, the Castilian Crown rescinded the Alhambra Decree treaty, and mandated that Granada's Muslims convert or emigrate. Under the 1492 Alhambra Decree, Spain's Jewish population, unlike the Muslims, had already been forced to convert under threat of expulsion or even execution, becoming Marranos (meaning \"pigs\" in Spanish), or Catholics of Jewish descent. Many of the elite Muslim class subsequently emigrated to North Africa. The majority of the Granada's Mud\u00e9jar Muslims converted so that they could stay, however, becoming Moriscos, or Catholics of Moorish descent (\"Moor\" being equivalent to Muslim). Both populations of conversos were subject to persecution, execution, or exile, and each had cells that practiced their original religion in secrecy.\nOver the course of the 16th century, Granada took on an ever more Catholic and Castilian character, as immigrants came to the city from other parts of the Iberian Peninsula. The city's mosques were converted to Christian churches or completely destroyed. New structures, such as the cathedral and the Chanciller\u00eda, or Royal Court of Appeals, transformed the urban landscape. After the 1492 Alhambra decree, which resulted in the majority of Granada's Jewish population being expelled, the Jewish quarter (ghetto) was demolished to make way for new Catholic and Castilian institutions and uses.\n\n\n==== Legacy ====\n\nThe fall of Granada has a significant place among the important events that mark the latter half of the Spanish 15th century. It completed the so-called \"Reconquista\" (or Christian reconquest) of the almost 800-year-long Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula. Spain, now without any major internal territorial conflict, embarked on a great phase of exploration and colonization around the globe. In the same year, the sailing expedition of Christopher Columbus resulted in what is usually claimed to be the first European sighting of the New World, although Leif Erikson is often regarded as the first European to land in the New World, 500 years before Christopher Columbus. The resources of the Americas enriched the crown and the country, allowing Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand to consolidate their rule as Catholic Monarchs of the united kingdoms. Subsequent conquests, and the Spanish colonization of the Americas by the maritime expeditions they commissioned, created the vast Spanish Empire: for a time, the largest in the world.\n\n\n== Heritage and monuments ==\nThe greatest artistic wealth of Granada is its Spanish-Islamic art \u2013 in particular, the compound of the Alhambra and the Generalife. The Generalife is a pleasure palace with attached romantic gardens, remarkable both for its location and layout, as well as for the diversity of its flowers, plants and fountains. The Alhambra is the architectural culmination of the works of Nasrid art that were undertaken in the 13th and 14th centuries, with most of the Alhambra having been built at the time of Yusuf I and Mohammed V, between 1333 and 1354.\nAt present, the buildings of Granada are typically bourgeois in appearance, with much of the architecture dating from the 19th Century, together with numerous Renaissance and Baroque buildings.\n\n\n=== Alhambra ===\n\nThe Alhambra is a Nasrid \"palace city\". It was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1984. It is certainly Granada's most emblematic monument and one of the most visited in Spain. It consists of a defensive zone, the Alcazaba, together with others of a residential and formal state character, the Nasrid Palaces and, lastly, the palace, gardens and orchards of the Generalife.\nThe Alhambra occupies a small plateau on the southeastern border of the city in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada above the Assabica valley. Some of the buildings may have existed before the arrival of the Moors. The Alhambra as a whole is completely walled, bordered to the north by the valley of the Darro, to the south by the al-Sabika, and to the east of the Cuesta del Rey Chico, which in turn is separated from the Albaic\u00edn and Generalife, located in the Cerro del Sol.\nIn the 11th century the Castle of the Alhambra was developed as a walled town which became a military stronghold that dominated the whole city. But it was in the 13th century, with the arrival of the first monarch of the Nasrid dynasty, Muhammad I of Granada (Mohammed I, 1238\u20131273), that the royal residence was established in the Alhambra. This marked the beginning of its heyday. The Alhambra became palace, citadel and fortress, and was the residence of the Nasrid sultans and their senior officials, including servants of the court and elite soldiers (13th\u201314th centuries).\nIn 1492 the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabela, expelled the final Moors from the city of Granada. They established permanent residency in the Alhambra, and it was here that Christopher Columbus requested royal endorsement for his westward expedition that year.\nIn 1527 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor demolished part of the architectural complex to build the Palace which bears his name. Although the Catholic Monarchs had already altered some rooms of the Alhambra after the conquest of the city in 1492, Charles V wanted to construct a permanent residence befitting an emperor. Around 1537 he ordered the construction of the Peinador de la Reina, or Queen's dressing room, where his wife Isabel lived, over the Tower of Abu l-Hayyay.\n\nThere was a pause in the ongoing maintenance of the Alhambra from the 18th century for almost a hundred years, and during control by the First French Empire, substantial portions of the fortress were blown apart. The repair, restoration and conservation that continues to this day did not begin until the 19th century. The complex currently includes the Museum of the Alhambra, with objects mainly from the site of the monument itself and the Museum of Fine Arts.\n\n\n=== Generalife ===\n\nThe Generalife is a garden area attached to the Alhambra which became a place of recreation and rest for the Granadan Muslim kings when they wanted to flee the tedium of official life in the Palace. It occupies the slopes of the hill Cerro del Sol above the ravines of the Genil and the Darro and is visible from vantage points throughout the city. It was conceived as a rural village, consisting of landscaping, gardens and architecture. The palace and gardens were built during the reign of Muhammed III (1302\u20131309) and redecorated shortly after by Abu l-Walid Isma'il (1313\u20131324). It is of the Islamic Nasrid style, and is today one of the biggest attractions in the city of Granada. The Generalife was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984.\nIt is difficult to know the original appearance of the Generalife, as it has been subject to modifications and reconstructions throughout the Christian period which disfigured many of its former aspects. All buildings of the Generalife are of solid construction, and the overall decor is austere and simple. There is little variety to the Alhambra's decorative plaster, but the aesthetic is tasteful and extremely delicate. In the last third of the 20th century, a part of the garden was destroyed to build an auditorium.\n\n\n=== Cathedral ===\n\nThe cathedral of Granada is built over the Nasrid Great Mosque of Granada, in the centre of the city. Its construction began during the Spanish Renaissance in the early 16th century, shortly after the conquest of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs, who commissioned the works to Juan Gil de Honta\u00f1\u00f3n and Enrique Egas. Numerous grand buildings were built in the reign of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, so that the cathedral is contemporary to the Christian palace of the Alhambra, the University and the Real Chanciller\u00eda (Supreme Court).\nThe church was conceived on the model of the Cathedral of Toledo, for what initially was a Gothic architectural project, as was customary in Spain in the early decades of the 16th century. However, Egas was relieved by the Catholic hierarchy in 1529, and the continuation of the work was assigned to Diego Siloe, who built upon the example of his predecessor, but changed the approach towards a fully Renaissance aesthetic.The architect drew new Renaissance lines for the whole building over the gothic foundations, with an ambulatory and five naves instead of the usual three. Over time, the bishopric continued to commission new architectural projects of importance, such as the redesign of the main fa\u00e7ade, undertaken in 1664 by Alonso Cano (1601\u20131667) to introduce Baroque elements. In 1706 Francisco de Hurtado Izquierdo and later his collaborator Jos\u00e9 Bada built the current tabernacle of the cathedral.\nHighlights of the church's components include the main chapel, where may be found the praying statues of the Catholic Monarchs, which consists of a series of Corinthian columns with the entablature resting on their capitals, and the vault over all. The spaces of the walls between the columns are perforated by a series of windows. The design of the tabernacle of 1706 preserves the classic proportions of the church, with its multiple columns crossing the forms of Diego de Silo\u00e9.\n\n\n=== Royal Chapel ===\n\nThe Catholic Monarchs chose the city of Granada as their burial site by a royal decree dated September 13, 1504. The Royal Chapel of Granada, built over the former terrace of the Great Mosque, ranks with other important Granadan buildings such as the Lonja and the Catedral e Iglesia del Sagrario. In it are buried the Catholic Monarchs, their daughter Joanna of Castile (Juana la Loca) and her husband Felipe I (Felipe el Hermoso). Construction of the Chapel started in 1505, directed by its designer, Enrique Egas. Built in several stages, the continuing evolution of its design joined Gothic construction and decoration with Renaissance ideals, as seen in the tombs and the 17th and 18th century Granadan art in the Chapel of Santa Cruz. Over the years the church acquired a treasury of works of art, liturgical objects and relics.\nThe Royal Chapel was declared a Historic Artistic Monument on May 19, 1884, taking consideration of BIC (Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural) status in the current legislation of Spanish Historical Heritage (Law 16/1985 of 25 June). The most important parts of the chapel are its main retable, grid and vault. In the Sacristy-Museum is the legacy of the Catholic Monarchs. Its art gallery is highlighted by works of the Flemish, Italian and Spanish schools.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Albayz\u00edn ===\n\nThe Albayz\u00edn (or Albaic\u00edn) is a neighborhood of Al-Andalus origin, much visited by tourists who flock to the city because of its historical associations, architecture, and landscape.\nThe archeological findings in the area show that it has been inhabited since ancient times. It became more relevant with the arrival of the Zirid dynasty, in 1013, when it was surrounded by defensive walls. It is one of the ancient centres of Granada, like the Alhambra, the Realejo and the Arrabal de Bib-Rambla, in the flat part of the city. Its current extension runs from the walls of the Alcazaba to the cerro of San Miguel and on the other hand, from the Puerta de Guadix to the Alcazaba.\nThis neighborhood had its greatest development in the Nasrid era, and therefore largely maintains the urban fabric of this period, with narrow streets arranged in an intricate network that extends from the upper area, called San Nicol\u00e1s, to the river Darro and Calle Elvira, located in the Plaza Nueva. The traditional type of housing is the carmen granadino, consisting of a free-standing house surrounded by a high wall that separates it from the street and includes a small orchard or garden.\nIn the Muslim era the Albayz\u00edn was characterized as the locus of many revolts against the caliphate. At that time it was the residence of craftsmen, industrialists and aristocrats. With the Christian reconquest, it would progressively lose its splendor. The Christians built churches and settled there the Real Chanciller\u00eda. During the rule of Felipe II of Spain, after the rebellion and subsequent expulsion of the Moors, the district was depopulated. In 1994 it was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site. Of its architectural wealth among others include the Ziri walls of the Alcazaba Cadima, the Nasrid walls, the towers of the Alcazaba, the churches of Salvador (former main mosque), San Crist\u00f3bal, San Miguel Alto and the Real Chanciller\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Sacromonte ===\n\nThe Sacromonte neighbourhood is located on the Valpara\u00edso hill, one of several hills that make up Granada. This neighborhood is known as the old neighbourhood of the Romani, who settled in Granada after the conquest of the city. It is one of the most picturesque neighborhoods, full of whitewashed caves cut into the rock and used as residences. The sound of strumming guitars may still be heard there in the performance of flamenco cantes and quej\u00edos, so that over time it has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in Granada.\nAt the top of this hill is the Abbey of Sacromonte and the College of Sacromonte, founded in the 17th century by the then Archbishop of Granada Pedro de Castro. The Abbey of Sacromonte was built to monitor and guard the alleged relics of the evangelists of Baetica. Those are of questionable authenticity, but since their finding the area has been a religious pilgrimage destination.The abbey complex consists of the catacombs, the abbey (17th\u201318th centuries), the Colegio Viejo de San Dionisio Areopagita (17th century) and the Colegio Nuevo (19th century). The interior of the church is simple and small but has numerous excellent works of art, which accentuate the size and rich carving of the Crucificado de Risue\u00f1o, an object of devotion for the Romani people, who sing and dance in the procession of Holy Week. The facilities also include a museum, which houses the works acquired by the Foundation.\n\n\n=== Charterhouse ===\n\nThe Charterhouse of Granada is a monastery of cloistered monks, located in what was a farm or Muslim almunia called Aynadamar (\"fountain of tears\") that had an abundance of water and fruit trees. The initiative to build the monastery in that place was begun by Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, known as El Gran Capit\u00e1n. The charterhouse was founded in 1506; construction started ten years later, and continued for the following 300 years.\nThe Monastery suffered heavy damage during the Peninsular War and lost considerable property in 1837 as a result of the confiscations of Mendiz\u00e1bal. Currently, the monastery belongs to the Carthusians, reporting directly to the Archdiocese of Granada.The street entrance to the complex is an ornate arch of Plateresque style. Through it one reaches a large courtyard, at the end which is a wide staircase leading to the entrance of the church. The church, of early 16th century style and plan, has three entrances, one for the faithful and the other two for monks and clergy. Its plan has a single nave divided into four sections, highlighting the retables of Juan S\u00e1nchez Cot\u00e1n and the chancel's glass doors, adorned with mother-of-pearl, silver, rare woods and ivory. The presbytery is covered by elliptical vaulting. The main altar, between the chancel arch and the church tabernacle, is gilded wood.\nThe church's tabernacle and sancta sanctorum are considered a masterpiece of Baroque Spanish art in its blend of architecture, painting and sculpture. The dome that covers this area is decorated with frescoes by the C\u00f3rdoba artist Antonio Palomino (18th century) representing the triumph of the Church Militant, faith, and religious life.\nThe courtyard, with galleries of arches on Doric order columns opening on it, is centered by a fountain. The Chapter House of Legos is the oldest building of the monastery (1517). It is rectangular and covered with groin vaulting.Mosque of Granada\nThe Mosque of Granada was inaugurated in 2003 on the summit of the neighborhood of Albayzin. The mosque was built near the Church of San Salvador and the Church of San Nicol\u00e1s. The Church of San Salvador was built on the site of the Great Mosque of Albayzin. The Society for the Return of Islam in Spain purchased the site in 1981, but it took many years for the plans to be approved. The mosque's initial funding was supplied by Shaykh 'Abdalqadir as-Sufi al-Murabit who envisioned providing Granada's new Spanish Muslim community with a mosque. Additional funding came from Malaysia, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. In 1991 the CIE (Comunidad Isl\u00e1mica en Espa\u00f1a) hired the architect Renato Ramirez Sanchez to design the mosque. In the 1990s, there was a heated debate pertaining to the design of the minaret. Construction eventually began in 2001. The mosque now serves about 500 people.\n\n\n=== Palace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar ===\nThe Palace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar was built in one of the most emblematic streets of Granada, the Carrera del Darro, at number 5. This place is an architectural example of the classical Granada during the Renaissance transformation of the XVIth century. It was built by the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar, great-grandson of both Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez del Pulgar (known by the name of El de la Haza\u00f1as [The One of the Valiant Deeds]) and Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (El Gran Capit\u00e1n [The Great Captain]), Captain-General of the Castilian-Aragonese forces that concluded the Reconquest of the peninsula. The palace is now the museum of perfumes El Patio de los Perfumes, with 1,500 square metres (16,000 sq ft) of floor space on two floors and 130 square metres (1,400 sq ft) of patio to relax surrounded by flowers and perfumes.\n\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nMonasterio de San Jer\u00f3nimo: monastery\nSan Juan de Dios Hospital\nCastril Palace\nMuseo de Bellas Artes de Granada\nMadrasah of Granada\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area of Granada ===\nGranada's metropolitan area consists of about fifty municipalities and the capital. Although it is not formally constituted as a political and administrative body, there are several public services that are combined. The arrival of many inhabitants of the capital and other towns in the province, influences a large Population growth. Despite the fact that the capital loses inhabitants, who move to neighboring towns. The main causes of the exodus towards the towns of the metropolitan area are, mainly, the difficulty of accessing a home in the capital because of the high prices it has and labor reasons, because in the towns of the periphery the majority are being located of industrial estates.\n\n\n=== Capital of Granada Province ===\nThe city of Granada is the capital of the province of the same name, thus all administrative entities of provincial scope dependent on the regional government and the state are located there. There is a provincial delegation from each of the governmental departments to the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, coordinated by a government delegate under the Ministry of the Interior. The national government of Spain has a sub-delegation in Granada, subordinate to the government delegate in the autonomous community.\n\n\n=== Judicial administration ===\nThe headquarters of the Superior Court of Justice of Andalusia, Ceuta and Melilla is in Granada, located in Plaza Nueva, in the building of the historic Royal Chancery, as well as the Superior Prosecutor's Office of Andalusia, located in the building of the Bank of Spain. It has a Provincial Court, located in Corteza del Carmen Street, and is also head of the Judicial Party No. 3 of the province, whose demarcation includes the city and 49 towns, some of them very populated, in the metropolitan area region.\nMost of the courts are located in two administrative buildings, in Plaza Nueva and Avenida del Sur. The set of judicial bodies is as follows: \n\nSuperior Court of Justice: President. Civil-Criminal Chamber. Contentious-Administrative Room. Social room.\nProvincial Court: President. Criminal: 2; Civil: 3\nCourts\n\n\n=== Municipal organization ===\nIts political administration is carried out through a City Council, of democratic management, whose components are chosen every four years by universal suffrage. The electoral roll is composed of all residents registered in Granada over 18 years of age, of Spanish nationality and of the other member countries of the European Union. According to the provisions of the General Electoral Regime Law, which establishes the number of eligible councilors according to the population of the municipality, the Municipal Corporation of Granada is made up of 27 councilors. In the municipal elections held in 2019 the constitution of the City Council was eleven councilors belonging to the Popular Party, eight to the Socialist Party, four belonging to Citizens Party, three to Vamos, Granada and one to the United Left-Socialist Alternative-For the People. After these results with the rise of the new political forces, PP and PSOE lost power; and after negotiations an agreement was reached with which Jos\u00e9 Torres Hurtado, mayor of the Popular Party, continues as mayor, under the supervision of the regeneration compliance required by the Citizens party. After his resignation, due to his involvement in Operation Serrallo / Nazar\u00ed, the socialist Francisco Cuenca was appointed mayor.\n\n\n=== Municipal districts and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Granada consists of eight districts whose population is distributed in the attached chart according to the 2009 census of the City of Granada. These districts formed a set of 36 neighborhoods. All boundaries of districts and neighborhoods were modified in February 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal service areas ===\nThe municipal government team has organized the distribution of management responsibilities, structuring itself in the following service areas: Weddings and Palaces, Equal opportunities, Economy, Education, Communication office, Unified license management, Youth, Environment, Municipal Office of Consumer Information, Citizen Participation, Group of Civil Protection Volunteers, Local Police.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n\n=== Realejo ===\nRealejo was the Jewish district in the time of the Nasrid Granada. (The centuries since the Jewish population were so important that Granada was known in Al-Andalus under the name of \"Granada of the Jews\", Arabic: \u063a\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648\u062f\u200e Gharn\u0101\u1e6dah al-Yah\u016bd.) It is today a district made up of many Granadinian villas, with gardens opening onto the streets, called Los C\u00e1rmenes.\n\n\n=== Cartuja ===\nThis district contains the Carthusian monastery of the same name: Cartuja. This is an old monastery started in a late Gothic style with Baroque exuberant interior decorations. In this district also, many buildings were created with the extension of the University of Granada.\n\n\n=== Bib-Rambla ===\nThe toponym derives from a gate (Bab al-Ramla, or the Gate of the Ears) that was built when Granada was controlled by the Nasrid dynasty. Nowadays, Bib-Rambla is a high point for gastronomy, especially in its terraces of restaurants, open on beautiful days. The Arab bazaar (Alcaicer\u00eda) is made up of several narrow streets, which start from this place and continue as far as the cathedral\n\n\n=== Sacromonte ===\n\nThe Sacromonte neighborhood is located on the extension of the hill of Albaic\u00edn, along the Darro River. This area, which became famous by the nineteenth century for its predominantly Gitano inhabitants, is characterized by cave houses, which are dug into the hillside. The area has a reputation as a major center of flamenco song and dance, including the Zambra Gitana, an Andalusian dance originating in the Middle East. The zone is a protected cultural environment under the auspices of the Centro de Interpretaci\u00f3n del Sacromonte, a cultural center dedicated to the preservation of Gitano cultural forms.\n\n\n=== Zaid\u00edn ===\n\nThis formerly blue collar but now upmarket neighborhood houses 100,000 residents of Granada, making it the largest neighborhood or 'barrio'. Traditionally populated by Romani people, now many residents are from North and West Africa, China, and many South American countries. Every Saturday morning it hosts a large outdoor market or \"mercadillo\", where many people come and sell their wares of fruits and vegetables, clothes and shoes, and other odds and ends.\n\n\n== Gastronomy ==\nThe gastronomy of Granada is part of the Arabic-Andalusian cuisine tradition, with a strong Arab and Jewish heritage, which is reflected in its condiments and spices, such as cumin, coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon, raisins, almonds or honey. The writer Miguel Alcobendas, author of the traditional cuisine of Granada, says that it has its origin in living together, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century (when Granada surrendered to the Catholic Kings), of Muslims, Jews and Christians in the Nasrid Kingdom from Granada. Subsequently there was a miscegenation with the kitchen of the Christians, in which the pork acquired an importance in the kitchen of Granada more than in the rest of Spain, since its consumption allowed its eaters to demonstrate a certain distance from the persecuted religions, since both Muslims and Jews have it banned.\nThe climatic differences of the different regions of the province, from the coast to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada propitiates a great variety of raw materials: vegetables], meats and sausages, fish that are combined in a multitude of dishes and recipes for soups and stews.\nThe famous and reputed Trev\u00e9lez ham comes from the Sierra of Granada, to which other pork derivatives are added, sausages such as chorizo, black pudding and pork tenderloin.\nHam and beans, two products of the land, are combined in one of its most typical dishes, beans with ham; Other known dishes are the Sacromonte tortilla, which among other ingredients must have cooked brains and veal crustaillas, chopped and sauted before mixing with the egg. It is also worth mentioning \"papas a lo pobre\", potatoes which are usually served with egg and fried peppers, as well as with pieces of pork or ham.\nAmong the stews and potajes, the pot of San Ant\u00f3n stands out, which is eaten mainly towards the second half of January; cabbage stew, which combines vegetables and legumes; the stew of green beans and fennel; The thistle and pumpkin casserole, with noodles and aromatic herbs, or gypsy pottery are other dishes of the land. \nConfectionery is well represented in the gastronomy of Granada, for sweets prepared by the nuns can be purchased in the numerous convents of the city: the pesti\u00f1os of V\u00e9lez or those of the Encarnaci\u00f3n, the puff pastries of San Jer\u00f3nimo, the moles of San Ant\u00f3n eggs, the Zafra biscuit, sweet potato rolls, cocas, roscos from Santo Tomas and mantecados. Aljoj\u00e1banas, honey and cheese dumplings and some of the fritters called almohados, as well as fig bread, Moorish roscos and an almond cake called soy\u00e1 are all of Arabic heritage. \nUnlike in other provinces of Andalusia, in Granada tapas (appetizers or snacks) are usually free in bars and restaurants. \"Bar hopping\" (Ir de tapas) and eating tapas in the time between finishing work and having dinner is a deeply rooted traditional activity among the people of Granada. There are different tapas routes around the city.\n\n\n== Leisure and entertainment ==\nIn Granada there is a wide program of leisure and entertainment, which covers a large number of fields, available to both visitors and citizens themselves. Of the leisure activities carried out, the following can be highlighted: \n\nThe zambras of Sacromonte. Old bridal parties held by the gypsies of the city, and that disappeared for years before their current vindication. They develop in the caves of the Sacromonte neighborhood and have a unique character in the world of flamenco. There are also more classic flamenco shows in the Albaic\u00edn. These flamenco shows, usually linked to restaurants, are one of the city's cultural attractions.\nFestivals. Granada has a very complete range of events: International Music and Dance Festival, International Jazz Festival, Granada Festival South Cinemas and International Tango Festival, among others.\nConcerts. Throughout the year there is a stable program of concerts in the Manuel de Falla Auditorium and theater and opera performances in the Congress Palace.\nParties. Throughout the year several parties are held on significant dates for religious, civil or cultural reasons.\n\n\n== Social welfare ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\n\n==== University ====\nThe University of Granada (UGR), founded in 1531 by Carlos I, meant the continuation of higher studies in La Madraza, when the city was the capital of the last Nasrid Kingdom. The University of Granada has become internationally recognized in all university fields: teaching, research, cultural and services to its members and its surroundings. It is therefore one of the destinations that receives more exchange students from the Erasmus Program13 and the fourth Spanish university in number of students, after the Complutense University of Madrid, and the University of Seville. \n\n\n==== Obligatory education ====\nIn the city there are a total of 69 compulsory secondary education centers. Infant and primary education is taught in 104 centers, distributed among private, concerted and public centers. There are also five adult education centers.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nIts public health system is the exclusive competence of the autonomous community, which provides two types of attention: primary, which constitutes the first level of access to the system; and the specialized one. Health centers and offices constitute the offer of primary care, differing from each other in the level of care they provide.\n\n\n==== Hospital network ====\nIts hospital network is basically composed of public hospitals managed by the Andalusian Health Service and other smaller private management centers. This network covers the needs of the city and its Metropolitan Area.

For this reason, the Social Welfare Delegation of the City of Granada has several municipal community social services centers, one for each local district, coordinated by Los Mondragones Municipal Administration located on the Fuerzas Armadas Avenue. In its internal organization the services provided are organized around each municipal center and therefore of each municipal district but also around groups. \n\n\n== Parks and gardens in Granada ==\nThe city of Granada has a significant number of parks and gardens, including:\n\n\n== Climate ==\nGranada has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) close to a cold semi-arid climate (BSk) Summers are hot and dry with daily temperatures averaging 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F) in the hottest month (July); however, temperatures reaching over 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are not uncommon in the summer months. Winters are cool and damp, with most of the rainfall concentrated from November through to January. The coldest month is January with daytime temperatures hovering at 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) and dropping to around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) during the night. Frost is quite common as temperatures usually reach below-freezing in the early morning. Spring and autumn are unpredictable, with temperatures ranging from mild to warm. Early summer in 2017 confronted the city with two massive heat waves that broke long-standing record temperatures starting on June 13, 2017, with a new maximum high for the month at 40.6 \u00b0C (old record 40.0), which was topped three times within the span of four days at 40.9 \u00b0C on June 14, 41.3 (June 15) and, eventually, 41.5 (June 17). The first two days of this heat wave ranked Granada first in both Spain and Europe, making it the hottest place on the given days. The second extreme surge in temperatures followed roughly a month later when readings soared to 45.7 and 45.3 \u00b0C on July 12 and 13, respectively, surpassing the old July record by almost 3 degrees.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nJudah ben Saul ibn Tibbon (1120\u20131190), translator and physician\nAl-Zuhri (fl. 1130s\u20131150s), geographer\nIbn Sa'id al-Maghribi (1213\u20131286), geographer, historian and poet\n\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n (1526\u20131588), admiral\nAlonso Cano (1601\u20131667), painter, sculptor and architect\nPedro de Mena (1628\u20131688), baroque sculptor\nJos\u00e9 de Mora (1642\u20131724), baroque sculptor\nFrancisco Mart\u00ednez de la Rosa (1787\u20131862), statesman, politician, dramatist and poet\n\u00c1ngel Ganivet (1865\u20131898), writer and dramatist\nMariana Pineda (1804\u20131831), liberalist heroine\nEugenia de Montijo (1826\u20131920), last Empress consort of France\nMariano Fortuny y Madrazo (1871\u20131949), painter, photographer, designer and scenographer\nPablo de Loyzaga (1872\u20131951), sculptor and professor of fine arts\nEmilio Herrera Linares (1879\u20131967), military engineer and physicist\nMelchor Fern\u00e1ndez Almagro (1893\u20131966), literary critic, historian and journalist\nFederico Garc\u00eda Lorca (1898\u20131936), poet and dramatist\nFrancisco Ayala (1906\u20132009), writer and critic\nLuis Rosales Camacho (1910\u20131992), poet and essayist from the Generation of '36\nJos\u00e9 Tamayo (1920\u20132003), theatre director\nManuel Jim\u00e9nez de Parga (b. 1929), lawyer, politician, diplomat and jurist\nMiguel R\u00edos (born 1944) rock singer and composer\nCarlos Cano (1946\u20132000), singer-songwriter\nManuel Orantes (born 1949), tennis player\nJavier Egea (1952\u20131999), considered one of the most important Spanish poets of the 1980s\nLuis Garc\u00eda Montero (born 1958), poet and literary critic\nChus Guti\u00e9rrez (born 1962), film director, actress and journalist\nMar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Rienda Contreras (born 1975), ski racer\nPablo Aguilar Berm\u00fadez (born 1989), basketball player\nLidia Redondo (born 1992), gymnast\nSam Hidalgo-Clyne (born 1993), Scotland international rugby union player (born in Granada, but moved to Scotland at age 3)It is the subject of the 1967 song \"Vuelvo a Granada\" by Miguel R\u00edos.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nConstruction of a light rail network, the Granada metro, began in 2007.

          "Great place to visit especially the Bio Dome. Wonderful for children, very interesting with lots to see and get hands on with. School parties will be there and maybe a bit noisy, but worth putting up with.",
          "The display of stuffed wild animals was cool, if not a bit bizzar. Reminded me of shopping at Cabela's at home. The birds of prey were cool, we just missed the show, but saw some outside their cages in the sun from not to far a distance. The other displays were mostly",
          "For all those wanting to spend a day learning in a fun and active way, this is the place to go. The park is huge and divided into so many sections. Go EARLY, or else you will not have enough time to see EVERYTHING!! It is exactly what the name says. A Science Park for both",
          "We loved the science park. The WOW exhibit was beautiful. I\u2019m not normally fond of taxidermy but the displays were artfully done in a way that showed how the animals would move. I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it. We allowed three hours for the whole park and it wasn\u2019t",
          "My favourite science museum is the one in Warsaw! All brill,whatever you touch is pure science,pure learning,no messing around with broken meaningless pieces...the one in Granada,on thd other hand,has meaningless,often broken pieces and installations....waste of time to a great",
          "Far too many highlights to mention. Must-sees are the Bioparc, the WOW Exhibition, the Music room, the Butterfly house. Not overpriced, good disabled access. Get there early to park in the small car park directly in front of the entrance. Make sure you hand in your car park",
          "In winter part is closed. but you still need at least 3 hours to get round parts. It's more a collection of several museums and not what I expected. Good for adults and especially children when fully open. Not seen anything like this elsewhere in Spain or UK",
          "Worth it for the BioDomo alone. Although fairly small, it packed a punch, and the kids loved it. You get given a one-hour slot in which to visit. The other exhibits, covering a range of topics such as the human body and music, were pretty good. Plenty of interactive things to",
          "A great Science Park just outside central Granada. Great interactive areas for both Kids and Adults. The BioDome is very good, with an amazing Aquarium, and various animals; some of which you can get very close too. The Butterfly farm is so interesting, we even watched a",
          "We spent over 5 hours here and still did not see everything. The biodome is very good, all the animals looked very well kept, and the display of stuffed animals is extraordinarily well done. There are hundreds of buttons to push and handles to turn. Not to be missed!",
          "Excellent mix of sciences. Biodome is a must if you visit. I enjoyed the music exhibition which is interactive, there is also a piano in the main circulation area that you can play. The views of the city and surrounding countryside are worth seeing from the lift accessed",
          "Who would have thought that there'll be a fantastic Science Park in Granada?! We went to the Biodomo and Museum. Our toddler loved the Biodomo. It's a very nicely maintained facility with lots of information. The museum is well worth a visit too. Lots of interesting exhibits and",
          "The Biodome is great,some animals roam free; Lemurs, Marmasets, Toucans and other birds.Care has been taken over habitat and they have successfully bred sloths this year. The outside, hands on , science and physics exhibits are well done and really interesting.There is also a",
          "Bit of a walk from the centre(25 mins), but for the entry price you get a lot. Loads to do and see, very nice, clean place. Kept us amused nearly all day. Staff all helpfull( especially the young guy in the Biodome). Nice cafe inside. Kids would love it( I did and I'm 64)",
          "What a find. We had a brilliant day out, both for the kids and the adults. A family tick was 40 euros, and worth every penny. There is so much to see and do here. We went into the BioDome first which contains a variety of animals and plants as well as a large aquarium with lots",
          "After surviving the tourism stampede and selfie-obsessed visitors of the Alhambra - discovering the Parque de las Ciencias was like a breath of fresh air. The scale and quality of the science exhibitions were very impressive. The welcome and advice from staff was wonderful. But",
          "I really enjoyed my day at the Science Park. I started with the Planetarium which was very interesting. Then it was off to the Bio Dome which is an aquarium and a tropical zoo with lots of wildlife. I then toured some of the exhibitions - the one about Music was outstanding.",
          "Located in an accessible, easy to find location. Well sign posted. Under \u20ac30 for two adults and a child. We went at the start of the Spanish school holidays. Activities from the moment you walked in. Demonstrations on various topics throughout the day. The bio centre and",
          "We went with our three kids, 14, 5 and 3. We all had a fantastic time. Price was very fair, around \u20ac50 for all of us including biodome. The planetarium was only in Spanish with no subtitles so we were advised against this when buying tickets as our Spanish definitely doesn't",
          "Lots of interesting activities for children. There is a cafeteria with hot and cold food. It is a little bit of walk to the metro station or bus stops.",
          "some really good informative and imaginative displays yet still so many static confusing displays. the planetarium was better than the london disneyesque planetarium- well done. but just so so many written information boards that one loses the will to read/live after a while- it",
          "The science park has interactive collections and displays that are interesting for all ages. I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone with a few hours to spare in Granada, as you'd want to stay longer to see everything. The Bio Dome costs a little extra, but it's worth it",
          "I couldn\u2019t imagine after visiting Granada so many times that this Science park/museum/city was here. It\u2019s a must if you have children and worth it at every age",
          "Oh, my, what a lovely surprise!! Exceptional for anyone of any age. The school groups did our heads in a bit :)) BUT 1)they are easy to dodge and 2)it's just delightful seeing children have FUN with science and not be attached to a screen. They're just so damn loud ahah Don't",
          "This is a delight to visit, full of interesting things to do for all ages, highly recommended during a visit to Spain.",
          "Had a brilliant afternoon at the science park, we are not kids but that really does not matter!! We loved the bio domo and all the exhibitions. Really worth a visit and allow a bit more time than you think!!",
          "A lovely selection of science displays, from the workings of the human body (with some real exhibits) through the Biodome of water, land and air flora and fauna (where we saw an amazing collection of stick insects - didn't know there were so many different types), to the",

          "The science Park is worth a look, it has something, I would say, for everyone, from the ' Journey through the human body' to the 'Planetarium' , which unfortunately only in spanish, but we were told this when we purchased our tickets. If over 65 take your passports to get the",
          "Lots has alreadt been said about the Science Centre. Great way to spend a few hours. Numerous interactive displays for all ages. The current Music exhibition is very good. The BioDome houses fish, reptiles, birds and mamals. Not very large but well laid out, easy to walk around",
          "Extraordinary birds demonstration. Large variety and very interesing demo and live class. Strongly recommend",
          "Although we\u2019re both in our 60s, my wife and I were like a couple of big kids during this visit! Simply, it is wonderful. So many things to see, experience and do. It made science really come alive. We wished school text books had been like this! We went for a couple of hours,",

          "What to do with a hyperactive seven year old visiting Spain? We spent six hours in the science park and didn\u2019t see it all. Our young nephew was totally enthralled but I suspect the adults enjoyed it even more. Really great day out at reasonable price. We will definitely return",
          "Can you believe it but we were unable to find a single car to hire in the whole of Granada today! Not one. So whilst the Alpujarras had to be delayed, we ended up going to this science park instead. Where did 4 hours go? It\u2019s just brilliant. From floating stones, to Einstein",
          "If you are in Granada and want to learn more about all sciences, the Parque de las Ciencias is a must. The main building, which has been standing for nearly two decades, still has very good and many zones where one can find out about optics, dynamics and several other scientific",
          "Worth a visit even if some of the exhibitions are a little dated. Some of the experiments are fun and interesting. Went up the tower, superb views of the city from up there. The butterfly house was fun to visit. Avoid the coffee shop. Ate a sandwich which was very tasteless,",
          "A great place to go visit to get out of the sun for a few hours, a mixture of science, history and live animals. Pay the extra to visit the biodome.",
          "A great place to relive your school day science experiments, all the hands on experiments takes ages to go through. Pay extra and visit the biosphere, well worth the visit and the staff are very friendly and willing to answer any questions about the animals. The planetarium",
          "The BioDome is worth paying the extra to go in. Highlight seeing the Sloth so close up. Some of the other attractions like the observation tower have odd opening times so we could not see them. The science exhibits look a bit dated in parts. Not seen that model Applemac",
          "Vast museum. In 6 hours we saw maybe half of it. The human biology and bio done were both exceptional exhibits. Absolutely worth a visit if you have any interest in science. Also makes a nice change after a few days of Renaissance history!",
          "We made the 2 hour drive, and it was well worth the distance. \u20ac35 for a family of 4 ( 2 adults, 2 children ages 11 and 2) this included the bio dome and planetarium. The planetarium talk is only available in spainish. Though, the lovely guide did he\u2019s best to explain in",
          "So glad we decided to put aside some time to visit this Science Centre. What a great family attraction. We have an 11 year old daughter and she really enjoyed trying all the interactive exhibits and visiting the biodome. We also had lunch in the cafe which was cheap and",
          "We spent most of a day at this science museum that includes many different activities all worth the visit. Be sure to include a visit to the Biodomo where you will see live animals including many different fish from around the world, lemurs, birds and insects. The museum is in",
          "Tons of stuff to see and do, very reasonably priced. families can easily spend a whole day and love every minute. I particularly loved the Bio Domes.",
          "So much to see! We escaped the 42 degree heat for a couple of hours and failed to scratch the surface. It is rare to find something a 10 year old boy and 15 year old girl can enjoy together! You could easily spend a day at the eclectic attraction. We loved the butterfly house",
          "The Biodome is not enormous, but certainly worth visiting. The aquaria are professionally presented while the terrestrial displays are very attractive. The Amazon area is especially impressive - Spangled Cotinga are a delight.",
          "We had a great day here. OUr kids (8 and 12) were there 6 house and felt like we didnt have enough time. The biodome. the outdoor play area, the butterfly garden, the building itself: it was great. I recommend it! (Take the city bus, it is a long way from city center)",
          "The human body exhibition was very interesting and covered a range of topics. The Bio Domo is an experience not to be missed - especially the toucans and lemurs. The wow exhibition was well crafted and informative on animal movement and hunting techniques.",
          "We visited on a Sunday as we didn\u2019t think it would need a long day we were wrong it was really interesting and nearly all in English and Spanish. The only let down was the planetarium which had no English but it was only a euro entry extra for this. The bio dome area was great",
          "Had a great 5 hours at the museum with our 12 year old. Did not buy tickets to the biodome and still was lot to see and do. Some were closed like the planetarium. Would recommed to anyone!",
          "Such a great experience for the whole family. We only had half a day and oilfield have spent a whole day!!",
          "We spent half a day here. Was surely better than expectations.The viewing gallery however was surprisingly closed for 3 hrs between 2-5 . Maybe the concerned staff were enjoying a spanish siesta.",
          "We were looking for a rainy day activity and found a description of the Parque de las Ciencias online. The biodome was definitely the highlight. Don\u2019t spend too much time looking at fish and reptiles. You've only got an hour, so save time for the upper level. Once you get to",
          "This is a large complex and the signage isn't great so it's worth looking at the maps dotted around to make sure you don't miss anything. There are exhibits both inside and outside to explore. It gives you a real 'hands on' experience. Many of the exhibits are interactive and",
          "We only had 2.5 hours and it was not nearly enough time. I cannot understand why this is not The Number One Thing to do in Granada. It is one of the best museums we have ever visited. There is an amazing amount of quality displays, most of which are hands on and interactive.",
          "As the title suggests, a visit to a place like this is not always something a family will choose, especially when time is limited and there are more historical places to visit. However, you won\u2019t be disappointed, and your kids including teenagers will certainly be entertained -",
          "Took the kids (9 and 1) here on a rainy day in April. We all had a fantastic time with the exhibitions, interactive elements and the knowledgeable staff. We have been to a few science parks/centres in the UK before but this one is far better. Strongly recommend.",
          "We stayed at a hotel not very far from this science park and musuem and decided to check it out after seeing the usual attractions in Granada. And we were very glad that we did. The grounds of the museum are quite large and contain a number attractions but the primary one is",
          "This was our 2nd attempt to visit the Science Park, we had originally tried on dia andalusia when there were queue around the block (we hadn\u2019t realised it was free to enter on that day) so had lots of anticipation building but and we have to say we were not disappointed! So",
          "I have to say that I had high expectations of this place which were sadly disappointed. I was expecting so much more than it delivered. In many ways this can be seen as Spain's answer to the Science Museum in London. Although some of the exhibitions were great and very thought",
          "Really great museum. The Biodome has a good variety of animals you can get very close to. The robot exhibit was well done. And there is an exhibit on animal biomechanics done with fabulous taxidermy. We spent 3 hours there as a diversion from churches and historic sites.",
          "So much to see here and you learn a lot. Takes at least 3-4 hrs (Some may spend whole day here) to get around and only 7 euros. Can't get nothing like this for double that price here.",
          "Granada is not just Alhambra and tapas. El Parque de las Ciencias has been an important place over the last 15 years for Granada. I\u2019ve visited few times, last one yesterday and was very good. Im not sure how no Spanish visitors will make to understand everything because I",
          "Very good for small kids, the Biodome and Butterfly park are small but well taken care of. The Wow exposition is impressive, even for adults . Good option to spend a few hours with the kids. They close at15h, so make sure you arrive early if you want to visita the whole park",
          "We\u2019ve been to the science park in Valencia and were interested to see how this compared. Some elements were very modern and engaging, whereas others were quite outdated and old fashioned. The signage (both inside and outside) is poor, we struggled to find the entrance on foot",
          "The Science Park is a must visit if you have young children. There is so much to do that you can easily spend a good part of the day. General entry to the park gives you access to everything other than the Bio Dome and Planetarium, both of which cost extra. There are a number",
          "Love the visit! It was a great day out especially on a Sunday where almost everything closes in Granada. We purchase the Biodome and museum tickets combo. Do note the park opening time is from 10-3pm on Sunday! This is a place to be visited for all ages!",
          "If you are a Science person, you don't want to miss this park. With a lot of exhibitions going on, special rooms and yard games, this is a nice way to spend a morning !",
          "We went to the Science Museum as it was a rainy day - and loved it! Fab modern buildings with easy underground parking. Very interactive and plenty of staff on hand to help at all levels. Lots of space, no crowding, light and airy and cool. Great modern displays and plenty of",
          "Great few hours at the science park. Nice walk to the park to see other parts of the city. Nicely laid out with various sections and it was nice to wander around all the exhibits. Some you can interact with and many with English descriptions. The BioDome is a must see and great",
          "What a great place for adults and children alike. Full of interactive hands on exhibits. Good for rainy or sunny day we enjoyed the bird of prey show ven though we did not understand what was said. Exhibits in Spanish and English. Tip take your own food there's was not good.",
          "I took my girl of 11 and boy of 9 and they loved it. We had a general admission ticket, with bio zone, which was well worth it. There are lots of things to interact with, both indoors and out. The restaurant was nothing special, but okay. The robot and body exhibitions were",
          "It's great. Especially the Bio Domo, that's a must. The guards don't like it when you pet the lemurs (so don't do it), but the lemurs don't seem to mind at all :) Also the current Wow exhibition was very well done and the Robots are also great - and there's an actual robot that",
          "Me and my children had an excellent time here. If you come to Granada, put some time aside to come here. Everyone enjoyed it. The staff were really helpfull and friendly.",
          "We had this as a feature on our Granada card and I'm not sure we would have known to go here otherwise. There were some extra features we paid for like the planetarium (all in Spanish, and my linguistic skills were not good enough to follow. However, the chairs were really",
          "Went here hoping to experience a natural environment for animals and birds. This is a science center that has a focus on teaching people about the environment and all aspects of natural science. With that understanding I recommend it for those whose interest is more suited to",
          "You can fill a whole day visiting this museum. Went as a couple but found plenty to occupy and entertain us. Good for all family members.",
          "I went to this park with my parents - as I'm twenty, we can consider between adults - and we all spent a very great afternoon there! It's a museum, but there's a lot to do in there! You can try everything, there's a room about human body, one about prevention, also one of robots",
          "As adults looking for something to do in the day, we really enjoyed the science museum. For the most part, the museum is aimed at children, and has lots of interactive educational elements. We however REALLY enjoyed the animal section, while the others laughed at me in the",
          "We had a fantastic half day at the Parque de las Ciencias with our 3 and 5yr old kids. The biodome in particular was fantastic - the kids loved the aquarium and walking through the tropical enclosures with tropical birds coming over to touching distance. They also enjoyed the",
          "We don't normally do science parks but visiting this one was a good decision. There was a good variety of activities which are interesting and also educational at the same time. We included a visit to the Bio dome which is a small extra cost but well worth it. You need at least",

          "The Granada Science Park and BioDome is a Must-do on your list in Granada. Modern and large compund with activities and exhibitions for all ages. Visit to BioDome is smart to purchase at entrance, they let people in in small pre-booked groups by the hour. Monkeys, sharks,",

          "We walked from our hotel Ibis on Sunday afternoon and had a very pelasant 20 minute visit before the warden told us the museum was closing! It closes at 3pm on Sundays, muc to our surprise... Pity as it looked like a really good place to visit!",
          "I was there in April this year. Very good organized, looks contemporary and most important thing -interesting for all members of the family. Look on the pictures.",
          "This was a very interesting place with lots to see and not too expensive to get in - just \u20ac8 if you just want to look at the main part then you can choose to add on the planetarium and /or biodome",
          "Robot exhibit not that interesting. Wildlife exhibition quite interesting. Lots space that could be filled with a lot more. However we didn't have time to visit the planetarium or butterflies exhibit. Restaurant good.",

          "The decision to visit the Science Park was well rewarded. It is a place which is very big with different expositions and scientific games to indulge with. I liked the exposition of BioDomo a lot. It includes different ecosystems (Asia, Madagascar, Amazon) along with the animals",
          "The Science Park in Granada is an array of really modern buildings that covers several acres in a coordinated plan by one of Spain's most famous architects. It stands in marked contrast to the historically rich architecture of the rest of the city. Well worth a visit!",
          "This park took it to the next level! Science immersion in the perfect way, worth a visit. Though some theaters were displayed only in Spanish, I wished they had at lead English translation.",
          "Even only visiting the museum and biodome but the experience is great..! Pay attention to visiting hours of the exhibits..",

          "Planned the visit well in advance. Used LAC bus to get close and then walked along the river. Entrance to the park is the same as the Biodome on the south side of the complex. Highlight of the visit was the lift to the top of the tower and the views from the tower. We",

          "Like a science theme park with many facets of science different exhibitions displays birds interactive learning similar to the science museum London",

          "What a fabulously entertaining way to spend a few hours! The complex is on the edge of the City and easily accessible for buses and cars. Good quality displays and the recent addition of the Bio-dome was inspiring. Good value too",
          "The Science Park is a 15-20min walk from the centre of town. We strolled alongside the Genil river and it's very easy to find from there. There's a general entrance fee, which provides a timed visit to the Bio Dome that you need to stick to. Apart from that, you're free to",
          "Well done to appeal to all . There is a raptor section and show well worth the time and effort. Heavily attended and all in Spanish. This does not detract from the bird show. The tower is also worth the ride up unless heights frightens you. Fantastic views. Many of the displays",

          "Took my 2 kids (4,7) here for the day - they both loved it. Tons to see, animals, interactive science / engineering type exhibits. We paid for the bio dome - it was worth the \u20ac6 or so for sure, decent sized aquarium, monkeys, alligators etc. Went up the observation tower, huge",
          "This is an interesting place with lots to see especially if you have a scientific mind. A change from the usual tourist places in Granada if ou wanted one.",
          "We spent a whole day at this attraction, it was interesting, varied and reasonably priced. I would recommend this attraction.",
          "Interesting interactive science park. A very large park with many different sections and exhibitions. Perfect for children and school-educational visits. Not enough thing directed to adults, for my taste.",
          "This is a greta place to spend time learning about the world and everything in it. Terrific for adults and kids alike. WE especially enjoyed the BioDomo. The Park is extensive and you could easily spend a week there.",
          "I came here with my boyfriend and we really enjoyed walking around and visiting the exhibits. The WOW exhibit is a must see, that was our favourite part. We did\u00b4nt see the space exhibit due to lack of time but great museum overall.",
          "This place is awesome - so much to explore! You'll need at least a day to really see everything. The complex is very impressive in itself, and between the butterfly house, the planetarium, the human body exhibits and the taxidermy, you'll never get bored.",
          "Our children ages 12, 8 and 4 enjoyed spending the day at the Science Park. We were there for 5 hours and did not get to see everything. This is a great quality museum that kept us all entertained with so much to discover. Even the food was good. Highly recommend if you are",
          "For a family that makes a point of visiting the local zoo, aquarium and science museum in each trip, this park was the best we have seen. Most important to the experience are the staff in each room who know the subject to the detail and are able to explain it the most",
          "If you're visiting Granada with kids and they're fed-up of history and cultural heritage, just take them to the science park. They'll have fun with its interactive activities and exhibitions specially designed for kids, the animals, etc.",

          "This is a nice leisure option for a day trip and an educational one for children, with dining options as well. However, keep in mind that this is Spain and even though this may be open during siesta hours, a lot of exhibits will likely be closed. We didn't get to see much of",

          "Being a huge science museum fan, it was a pleasure to visit the Parque de las Ciencias, Granada. The famous ants on the observation tower were something I had to see. I only had one day in Granada, so the visit was short to the park, and I elected to be there at opening time.",
          "I had been here before a few years ago, but was well worth a second visit as they had new exhibitions and areas to see. Watch out for the timings though, by the time we had had a good look around and some refreshments by the cooling water feature, the Bio Domo which we had paid",
          "One of the strangest science museums I have ever experienced. Written information was geared towards adults with master's level educations. Hands-on displays gave small kids something to play with while providing no education. Many displays were broken and some exhibits were",

          "After what we saw in Valencia, we didn't expect quite the same, but we did enjoy it almost as much. Compared to the Ciudad de las ciencias of Valencia, Granda's science park is smaller yet ti still offers plenty for the youngsters to enjoy. The Maze, the giant chess board, the",

          "We have been to the Science Park many times, but this year wanted to see the new Biodome. It is VERY impressive. It has been very carefully set out, and all the exhibits are of the highest quality, starting with an aquarium experience right through to the ring-tailed lemurs",
          "We have had a wonderful day here, there is so much to see and do we virtually ran out of time. Staff very helpful. English and Spanish spoken. Pay the extra to go into the Bio Dome, an awesome experience. Such a good value day for money.",
          "We took our 9 year old gran\u010fson here in August, it is a fantastic place for both young and old. Even before you go through into the park itself there are lots of hands on exhibits to interest all. We decided as there was so much to see and do we left the biodome and planaterium",
          "This science park is so large that its campus has several different buildings. Each exhibit is very well done in both Spanish and English. If you have only two hours to explore, take in a few of the exhibits. If you have more time to spend, take in the museum, the planetarium",
          "Spent a day here with the wife and kids aged 9, 7, 5 and a 6 month old baby. Found the review comparing it with the Natural History Museum a little bizarre, comparing apples and oranges in my opinion. I've been to the NHM, as well as Glasgow Science Centre. GSC is about double",

          "I went here with my boyfriend as we got entry to it with Alhambra Tourist Card that we payed for so we wanted to make the most of our money. Some areas are very good and interesting (journey through the human body, animal skeletons) but other areas only have interactive parts",
          "You would need a whole day to explore this park. We were there on a Sunday from the time it opened (10 am) to the last minute (3 pm), and we did not have a chance to see everything it offers. The observatory talks are very nice! There are a lot of activities illustrative basic",
          "Spent a whole Sunday at the Science Park - so many different attractions! As well as many hands-on activities (perfect for both children and adults), there were many other parts to the Park including a butterfly house, a bird display and a stuffed animal exhibition. My favourite",
          "We spent over 4 hours in the science park. The kids (9&12) had a ball and could have spent longer. Really well laid out, very spacious and lots of interactive exhibits. Plenty for older kids and adults as well. Strongly recommend it as an alternative day out- especially on a",

          "The science park always has great exhibits. I highly recommend seeing what they have on display. It is a great place to take kids.",
          "Excellent activities for kids (both you fog and teenagers). Plenty for adults and the exhibit on the history of Andalusia/al andaluz is world class in its conception and execution.",
          "This is an amazing place. We were looking for something to do with 3 young children to get them out of the midday sun for a couple of hours, we came to the Science Park without any expectations but ended up staying here all day - it's an excellent day out for all ages - from",
          "So much to do! This museum has a mix of things to see and things to do, with a fantastic range of topics. The static rooms are educational and open, and the temporary exhibitions/themes are always interesting. They are focussing more on having things explained in English, an",
          "My friend and I got the Granada card (definitely worth the money) and the science park was included with free admission. We decided to give it a shot. The bus system is easy enough but tell the driver which stop you're looking for and he will help you get off the bus - if no one",
          "I would have liked to visit this, but although advertised as open on Sundays it was closed without any explanation. Very disappointing.",
          "My kids loved their afternoon at the science park! lots of fun activities even if they did not understand Spanish (we did so less of an issue). Very nicely done, would love to have a pack/museum like this in my town/area!! Great for all ages, mine from ages 4 to 11.",
          "We spent the afternoon here as a change for our 11 year old from looking at historical sites. He really enjoyed it especially some of the interactive sections. We would have liked more of the museum to be hands on. Do check the handouts for various opening and closing times as",
          "My friend and I decided to visit just because we had time. It was very quiet when we went - maybe because Granada has so much more of offer. Still it was pretty fun and they have good facilities. Their planetarium was the best thing about it but probably wouldnt go again.",
          "We've been to a lot of science museums and this was one of our favorites! We were there 4 or 5 hours until closing, and we didn't come close to seeing everything. It was a great break from all the historical sites. There was a fabulous traveling exhibit about a prehistoric",
          "Frankly I was not amazed at all. It's a massive building but not properly optimised to host scientific things. The expositions were quite poor, but at least they made an effort to add short translations in English. Outside the main building there is a butterfly garden, with 10",
          "The exhibits and games are interesting. The only issue is much of the park takes a siesta 3-5, so that's a good time to avoid. Don't miss the butterfly building. In addition to large and unskittish butterflies, it has unusually colored turtles. A warning for the squeamish or",
          "Our hotel was a 13 minute walk from here so we popped in to take a look. Exhibitions were very good with lots of interactive displays which my daughter age 12, my husband and I and the grandparents thoroughly enjoyed! We went in Sunday open 19am till 3pm and there was still more",
          "Visited the science park as the weather was a bit cold and overcast. Was expecting to be charged quite a lot, as different areas had their own individual cost. Was pleased to pay just one price, 7\u20ac each was excellent value for the amount of time we were there. Particularly",
          "When I went there was an impressive mummy collection from all over the world. I must admit it was freakish. There was also an exhibit on \u00d6tzi and Neanderthals - the most in-depth I've ever seen. The gift shop has decent prices and a lot of neat curiosities that make good gifts",

          "First of all, our 12 year son is heavily into science. We (the parents) are artists. Enough Said. I was dreading a whole day in the science park. BUT WAIt TIL YOU GET THERE!!!! It is fantastic beyond your wildest dreams - an amazing array of different zones to cater to all areas",

          "Having encountered an unusually overcast day in Granada, we decided to take our three year old to the Science park. The site is pretty big, and took us the best part of a day to get round it all. The park is divided into several areas over a wide space, so comfortable shoes",
          "Good price for this attraction. Very well set up, nice staff and gift shops. The butterfly house was awesome, but Josefina and Angela and their hawk, owl, and falcon at the birds of prey exhibit were really special. The hawk flying nearby in the photo actually grazed me passing",

          "We had 2 kids with us, 10 and 12. They loved it, we did too. Have been in lots of science museums and this is one of the best. NB lots of interactive stuff. My wife is a retired nurse and even she learned new stuff in the body zone. All this for 6.5\u20ac !!!",
          "The science park is good value for money as there is plenty to see and keep you busy all day. I particularly liked the butterfly house there and the bird of prey show. The tower provides excellent all round views but be sure you don't miss out on it because it is closed for",

          "My sisters and their children visited the science park whilst my father and I went to Cordoba and although I didn't visit it, I sure wish I had! All of the kids and adults who went, without exception, could not fault this museum in any way and had lots of really positive",

          "Great fun, easy access from car park situated underneath which cost practically nothing when visiting the science park. The park is way to big to visit everything in one day with young children but great fun to pick and choose the areas that interest you. Great outdoor learning",
          "We all loved it here, esp kids, aged 3 and 6. They liked it so much we went again 6 months later.Kids favourite thing was the huge marble run. Only let down was my son was to young to go into the planeteruim. Value for money is excellant, you will need a whole day for this.",
          "I visited this expo/park on a whim as there was an expo going on to celebrate the park's 18th anniversary. It is a nice little centre with good examples of scientific principles and applications. Well worth the effort.",
          "an impressive science museum. I only had enough time to see the historic sciences from the moorish rule, and the human body pavilion and they were both awesome. This is also a good place to pick up the granada card, which includes entry to this science park, the alhambra and",
          "A very nice museum with a lot of activities and many interesting exhibitions. I didn't enjoy all of them the same, but most of them were really innovative and intriguing. I specially recommend it to families with small children, although it's not addressed only to them.",
          "So much to see and do. Well organized and interactive. Highly recommended for all ages. A variety of exhibits that will interest young and older visitors.",

          "I wandered into the science park not expecting to spend a lot of time there. I was wrong and spent the entire day there. The staff are all friendly and very informative. Should have taken a picnic as the food in the caf\u00e9 wasn\u2019t up to much. The butterfly house was very good",
          "As a non Spanish speaking family, this did not hinder what was a full on interactive day. It was a shame that on a Sunday it closed at 3pm as we still had areas to explore, even after arriving at 10am. I would fully recommend this to any family. A great day out.",
          "Probably would have not gone if the ticket for the Alambra included some other sites. Was very interesting, they had a short demonstration of Birds of Prey flying around.",
          "Stayed quite near by so just popped in for a look, and were not disappointed. the layout is a little confusing at first but once you have worked it out its fine. The puppet exhibition was excellent and lots of interactive thing to play with! we didn't have a lot of time so it",
          "The museum has a lot of temporary exhibit space along with their permanent installations. When I was there I saw the Puppets exhibit which was far more impressive and enjoyable than I would have thought puppets could be. There was also an exhibit on the human body and other",

          "We went here while visiting family in Granada and took our niece and nephew.. they absolutely LOVED it! Lots to do and see! Make sure you have plenty of time to look around- with smaller kids they may get a bit bored or tired out so take the strollers! Very neat place to visit!",
          "I'm conscious that many of the posts here from people with kids are very positive. So it may be that having no kids has impacted my view. I just felt the place was generally out dated and lacking much modern insight into science. For example it would have been fun to see the",

          "We came across the Science Park by accident whilst looking for our Hotel in Granada, and decided to give it a visit. It is closed on Sundays and Mondays. But we went for a quick visit before heading home on the Tuesday. Well.. The quick visit ended up being a full day visit!",
          "I could have spent hours in the butterfly house. The staff were very informative telling us about the butterflies and we watched as one hatched. Although we spent the day there I don't think we saw everything. Fantastic for children as lots of interactive exhibits.",
          "We got the \"bono tur\u00edstico\" and planned to spend half a day at the Science park, but there is so much to see and our children (aged 10 and 13) liked it so much, that we actually stayed there for the whole day! The food at the restaurant was also very nice and reasonably priced.",

          "I got there really late, so only had a short time to run through the exhibits. The dinosaur exhibit was amazing. Though, I should mention its been a while since I've been to one. The human body one was also very interesting, though probably not good to do if you've just eaten or",
          "Plenty to see and do for all the family. Changes of expositions.",
          "I went here with school while staying in Granada, I went to 2 exhibitions: human body and dinasaur, both were excelant. The human body one exceptionaly intresting and interactive. We also went to the planetarium, unfortunely it was all in spanish. I fell asleep. Overall this was",
          "We spent a rainy afternoon at the Science Park & it was a nice way to spend a few hours. The exhibits change so it won\u2019t always be the same stuff. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a \u201cmust do\u201d in Granada (because it could really be anywhere in the world it just happens to be in Granada)",
          "Lots of things to see and experiment, we parents loved it as much as the kids did. Our favourite were \"travel to the human body\": Very helpful staff too. Dinosaurs exhibition was on, that was quite good too. The Planetarium show was excellent, very informative. It's not hugely",
          "The Science Park ads and description sound much better than the parc actually is. It is very basic and unless you have small children with you (up to 10), it is a bit too simple to really tickle your brain cells.",
          "The science Park is amazingly varied from birds of prey displays to the history of Spain and the Middle Eastern influence and civilisation. If there had been another rainy day, we would have gone for a second day. Don't know if Thursday is school trip day but there were hundreds",
          "This attraction is well worthy of an entire day's visit. The restaurant (cafe with self service) is very mediocre. The only disappointment was the butterfly pavillion ... I only saw 4 butterflies! If one needs a taxi on exiting, this can be requested at the information desk,",
          "Great place to spend a few hours, especially if you like \"Science and Industry\" type of exhibits. Make sure you plan some extra time in order to view a documentary in the planetarium. A tiny and very cosy planetarium with a very low entrance fee.",
          "This museum is worth visiting when in Granada. All of there exhibits were very well put together and very educational. Getting there is doable by bus.",
          "I live in Valencia, home to the Spanish National Science Museum and wasn't really expecting very much but was very pleasantly surprised. The museum is really big with lots of variety and really interesting and interactive. Much better than the Valencia one! We didn't really give",

          "Great museum, very interactive and recently renovated. The butterfly house was especially gorgeous.",
          "we have a membership for Granada Science Park. Money well spent",
          "This was a pretty cool science museum and tons to do to keep the kiddos busy. We got there about 3 and it closed at 7, so 4 hours total. We still didn't get to see everything, so plan accordingly. Also eat prior or bring snack/meal. I'm not \u2026",
          "This was an excellent place to visit. The Biodome was by far the best part - there are parts you walk through that are completely open to the animals - the lemurs and marmosets come right up to you and jump over your head! We went on the \u2026",
          "Fascinating visit - really special exhibits very well presented.",
          "Awesome science museum with various exhibitions and workshops. Biodomo was a special experience",
          "What a great place. We are on a tour of Europe and this is our 4th science museum and this is up there with London. Kids just loved it, lots of interactive stuff for our boys (5&3) to do and the bio dome is fantastic. Bits of it are Spanish \u2026",
          "Good park and museum, after Valencian city of art and science it was not that interesting for me in museum, but still I recommend you to go there, also price 7 eur for museum is very good. Most of all i enjoyed wow exhibition, never seen  animals in such poses. Also nice area outside, and lots of wild birds you can see for free",
          "Very interesting exposition, especially a lot of it is interactive: you can touch / launch it and see how it works, e.g. Foucault Pendulum, water transportation system, solar fountain, mountain formation. About 95% of materiel is English-translated. The exposition is huge, I could have spend 3+ visits there.",
          "Amazing museum. The WOOW exhibition is one of the best animal exhibition I've seen!",
          "There's enough to do here to spend the whole day. The bird show is included in the ticket and worth going to. The biodome and planetarium are extra but all together still very reasonable. Some of the exhibits are broken and a bit dated but they will keep kids entertained.",
          "The place is amazing, the Biodome is beautiful although The Amazon section was closed. I\u2019m giving 3 starts only because the service is not as it should be. First of all they told us by phone that the Biodome opens at 13h, and when we \u2026",
          "A great science museum, for all ages. BioDome is a really cool small zoo, with high degree of immersiveness. A lemur pooed like a handspan away from me! So cool!",
          "Mostly for kids. As an adult there are a few interesting exhibitions, and there is a nice outside park to explore a bit. Don't expect any spectacular things though.",
          "Great place of culture and knowledge.",
          "Loved it! Can easily spend a whole day there and not see everything. Traveled around Spain and this was my favorite part of the whole trip. The bio-dome, butterfly enclosure and stuffed animal exhibit were highlights. So many interactive and fun science exhibits.",
          "While mainly targeted at kids, particularly the outdoor educational activities, you'll enjoy it too and there is more than enough stuff for adults. There were a couple of fascinating temporary exhibitions, and I got to reflect on a lot of biology and see some cool machines. The only danger is spending too much time here.",
          "Great day out for the kids. A wide variety of topics covered to keep their minds active. They especially liked the robots section. Staff were helpful and polite.",
          "Really fun day out. Loads to things to look at and explore whatever age you are!",
          "Very interesting and lotto do and see. The butterfly exhibit is beautiful, the different natural exhibits are fantastic, the stewards and stewardesses were very friendly and spoke adequate English. I will return!",
          "Very cool place. You can easily spend several hours here. Signs are mostly in English and Spanish.",
          "Excellent day out for all ages, I visited with 3 generations of my family and we were all thoroughly entertained. Spent 5 and half hours and didn\u2019t cover everything, Bio-dome is an additional charge but very worthwhile. Most of the \u2026",
          "Great experience!",
          "Great for the whole family. Be prepared to spend all day here with plenty to see and do. Show your children relics (windows 98 based PCs) and the wonders of science.",
          "Excellent for children, and adults. Kept all entertained for at least 3 hours.",
          "I would love to see the science exhibitions but I will not go because I do not support animals in unnatural captivity doing shows. I don\u2019t think anyone should enjoy seeing animals doing something they don\u2019t want to do so if you ever remove this part I will visit!",
          "Amazing place to spend a day... Especially if you\u00b4re with kids. There are so many interesting things to see, and you can also bring some food with you and make a picnic there as there is a place for it as well. Really there are enough sights and activities for the whole day",
          "A really good way of spending 2 or 3 hours.  Professor Hawking might find it limiting but for retards like us (who've forgotten most of any science we knew) it was fine.  Mostly English titling as well as the Spanish and plenty of hands on stuff.  Would interest anyone from 5 to 105 unless you've lost your interest in things. ",

          "Many interesting things. Different expositions. I was 3 hours there ",
          "Absolutely wonderful museum but leave enlugh time. It is huge and well worth the time.",
          "Fantastic place for kids",
          "Nice building and center, but aimed at children",
          "We loved an interactive playroom for the kids, and certain exhibitions, the tour on the tower with views over Sierra Nevada. The worst thing is that the place closes the most of interesting places for 3hr siesta. Feels incredible barbarity in the 21st century.",
          "Frankly I was not amazed at all. It's a massive building but not properly optimised to host scientific things.\nThe expositions were quite poor, but at least they made an effort to add short translations in English.\n\nOutside the main \u2026",
          "Good, I recommend you go up in the tower as you get an excellent view of the city",

          "This is a good little site, but really not enough for the \u20ac5 entrance fee (which also covers two other sites). The good thing about that is that you\u2019ll have the place per much to yourself for the three minutes you spend in there. Not much in the way of information",
          "Yes, the bath is old (11th century), but there is literary nothing to see. the ticket costs 5 EUR and it allows you to visit 3 other places (again not that interesting and not located closely to each other) - Dar al-Horra Palace, Horno de Oro House and Corral del Carbon. So, if",
          "We wondered from room to room. It was interesting to seen the columns and stars and circles in the roof for light but it would have been even better if there had been some explanations for each room. Free entry on Sundays.",
          "As has been said this is a small place but is only a short walk from the centre. You can purchase a ticket (5 Euros) which covers this and other sites around the Albacin. As has been intimated below it is a wonder this has even survived. The short visit does require imagination",
          "El Banuelo is well positioned on the side of the river walk in the Albaucin area of Granada. The smallish network of rooms are empty so you need to use your imagination to envisage the baths in use, but the architecture is authentic and the stonework helps create an atmosphere",
          "For the cost of an icecream you can step back in time, a small beautiful hamman. We loved it , yes you are spoilt by so many other great places in Granada but this is an understated little gem. If you are in the Darro area just drop in for twenty minutes of tranquility and rest",
          "We visited on Sunday and apparently it is free on Sunday to visit this place. Normally cost is 2 euros per person. I cannot imagine why they are charging for this place. There is really nothing to see here. You cannot even imagine what it used to look like. Maximum it will take",
          "El Ba\u00f1uelo is a nice example of Arab baths in Granada. It consists of three halls, and you access the bath from a small courtyard luxuriant in vegetation. The ceilings have holes (some of them in the form of a star) to let in some daylight, but not too much. It is restored, but",

These baths were built in the 11th century and are considered to be among the oldest baths in Spain. Apart from being a place of hygiene, this was a traditional meeting point",

          "This old home comprises the stone structures of a well-to-do family or extended family, but only the stone remains. I found it interesting, but not exceptional. What is would have looked like as an occupied home is left to the imagination. We see only what is left.",
          "The ruins are small but fully intact. They have iPads that show you what the space would have looked like when it was new which was really cool. Its 5 euros to get in which seems like a lot for what is there but it also gets you into several other sites around the city. Its",

          "Like most Moorish cities, Granada would have had plenty of public baths. This is said to be the only one to have survived \u2013 not as a functioning bathhouse, but as a relic. That said, it's worth spending a moment contemplating how people were once here leaning on the same stones",
          "Nice to see. Great 3D reproduction in iPad in last room. Awesome old city gate outside too on the opposite side of the road. The baths are very well preserved. I saw them in Ronda too. Very similar. Great to see.",
          "Slightly oversold by our guide book but great value at \u20ac5 for three sites (we saw all three). Pity the iPad interactive information in the rooms was flaky. Quite small so probably very crowded in high season (we went in January - very quiet!)",
          "This is the best preserved medieval hammam in Granada, if not in Andaluc\u00eda, and has thus mercifully been spared the over-restoration which characterises many other survivals of this period in Granada. The baths are quite small, comprising courtyard, anteroom, cold room, warm",
          "Lovely, well-preserved Moorish bath house. Fascinating as you imagine the Arab life and their deep necessity for cleanliness.",

          "I\u2019ve noticed that some reviewers aren\u2019t too impressed with these ancient Arab baths, but it is a wonder that they survived so intact, considering the reconquering Spanish monarchy and local authorities over the centuries worked so hard to remove most evidence of Moorish life in",

          "On the main street below the Alhambra but with very discrete signage means you could easily walk past it and not realise it was there. These well preserved moorish baths are one of the oldest buildings in the area and well worth a visit. Not huge and it won't take you long to",

          "Having seen many of the reviews on TA, wasn't sure about this, but was fortunate to visit on a 'free' day. Would have happily paid to enter, as the oldest building in Granada is wonderful. Just walking between the 3 or 4 rooms, it was easy to imagine how it must have looked a",
          "The Banuelo is part on a broader tour and can be integrated into a tour of numerous sites or independently. It is a mere 2.5 euros to enter and consists of an outdoor pool area and a small number of interconnecting rooms. There are monitors which tell you a little about the",

          "After quite a number of visits to Granada we FINALLY found the old baths! We honestly thought that they were the Hamman which were so widely advertised around town. They are close to one another so it was a forgivable mistake to make! These are tucked around a corner with almost",

          "You can easily walk past the entrance and as a result the visit is fairly quiet. Not that much to see. The three rooms and little courtyard. But only 2 euros. Troposo says it's free. Little video installation provides some computer graphic info. Ok but not a must do",
          "This structure is, I think, the only remaining bathhouse in the city, and you could tour it very cheaply. We enjoyed seeing the historic structure and imaging what it would have been like in the olden days.",
          "We popped in here as we had a bit of time to kill before going to the train station. The star shaped carved ceilings and the coolness of the rooms is nice but you need a lot of imagination to tell what it would have been like originally as there isn't much else to see.",
          "Ok, it's clear from the reviews on here that expectations will have a big impact on how you experience this astonishing survival, tucked under other buildings at the foot of the Albaicin. The only reason it's still there at all is that it was built over, when any other ba\u00f1uelo",

          "I note that at least one other reviewer says this attraction is free - we were charged \u20ac2.25 each. For that there were three empty rooms which were clean enough but showed little restoration. In it's favour there were good quality interactive terminals which allowed you to see",

          "From a total of 21 baths that were in Granada the El Banuelo is the oldest public building in the city. Also called a \u201chammam\u201d it is located on the street entering the Old Moorish District (Albacin). The main entrance is formed by a house remodeled in the Christian period",
          "We were lucky to be the only visitors when we arrived, and were given a personal tour by one of the guides. She took us around the baths and patiently explained their history while I translated to my two sons who do not yet speak English. They generously offered to keep our pram",
          "Made a stop here while wondering around the Plaza Nueva. Up along the riverside sits these old Arab Baths. The entrance is free and going around the first thing you notice is how the building has been kept to its original way. A very nice place to visit if you have 30 mins",
          "Need to point out, first, that on the day we went, there was no admission charge and it was explained that excavation/renovation work was still in progress, so by now they might be charging admission (so it's best to check ahead) .The guy at the front was very nice, cordial,",

          "If you've never seen baths, you should visit this place, but look carefully. The first day, we walked right past the entrance, then we saw what we thought was the entrance, which was closed. If you do the same, go back down & turn right. Look for the tiny sign.",
          "Not a big tourist attraction but worth the short detour to explore these Ancient Baths. Admission is free and it's nice to see something this wonderful without swarms of people. Quiet, beautiful and a wonderful little slice of historical Granada.",
          "Had tripadvisor not existed, we would never had stopped and enter this tiny place en la Carrera del Darro. These old baths are extremely well conserved and so peaceful. It really is amazing to imagine how they were used. A highly recommended visit.",
          "I knew of this spot but it is hard to find, and you must look out for a sign on the building as you walk up the riverside. Free to enter, it is very small and only contains the rooms but no water in baths as they are no longer used.",

          "First of all, it's free. You can't beat that! It's a little easy to miss like others have said. It's right on the corner and has a tiny door. The guy at the door was nice too :-) The baths are interesting for a historical purpose but the place isn't large at all. You can do this",
          "The baths are up the path on the Darro 10 minutes from the main plaza. Free admission and most importantly a great place to cool off away from he heat. The building itself is completely empty but restored nicely. You don't need to make an extra trip to see the baths but if you",
          "Very humble preservation of an Arab bath house. Free admission and information panels providing all you could need about the place. There isn't much left of the baths themselves. Only the foundations. TIPS: - It is only open from 10am to 2pm - Very close to the plaza Nueva -",
          "These arab baths are fairly hard to spot, but are located just up from Plaza Nueva on the Carrera del Darro. We've walked along on several occasions without seeing them. There is a ticket office with a man who asks where you are from and then tells you admission is free. I'm",

          "Very well worth a visit. Be there at opening 9.30am if you want to take pictures. The crowds will be a negative. We were there alone, and took all the pics we wanted. When we left, groups were coming in and it would have been impossible to shoot photos. It closes at 2.30 pm.",
          "Hours are limited and there's not a lot to see, but you can't beat the price (free). Still, it is worth a visit to get a sense of how these baths actually worked. The informational panels are multi-lingual and do a good job explaining what you can't see. Definitely worth a",

          "Having spent the previous two days exploring the Alhambra followed by the streets of Albaicin, it was pleasantly relaxing to discover this treasure. The gardens aren\u2019t over-ornate. The pond has clean, clear water fed by a small stream that runs across an interesting arched",

          "Nestled in the hills below the popular (and very busy Alhambra) this set of Gardens is certainly worth a look. There are walks along pretty flowerbeds with spectacular views over Granada. There are arches, statues and a large duck pond with some of the clearest water I've seen!",
          "Came up here towards the end of a 2 week stay in Granada and thought it was absolutely marvellous. The house itself is stunning - cleaners were in after a wedding allowing us to get a sneaky peek. The gardens were splendid but in a faded sort of way, far from perfectly",

          "Lovely place just to go around and avoid the crowd in La Alhambra for some moments. Gardens are quite nice.",
          "Mirador de San Nicolas has a better view. However, if in the area, this is quite an interesting garden to visit for its architecture. View of city is also not bad.",
          "This is a beautiful 'carmen', with a Nasrid courtyard, manicured gardens and a couple of peacocks hanging about, so it probably seems odd to rate it as average. However Granada offers so much beauty and there are so many awe-inspiring sights that I didn't find this exceptional.",
          "Came across these gardens by accident but we were very glad we did. Unbelievably in such a touristy city, these beautiful gardens and ponds are completely free and we spent a wonderful hour strolling around the site. They have ancient palm trees that are over seventy feet high",
          "This beautiful estate is now a publicly owned park that is free to visit. It's a bit of a walk, but well worth it, especially in the summer, when its considerably cooler than much of the city. Lovely, peaceful, and relaxing, with a lot of poetry to read throughout the park.",

          "Carmen de los Martires is an incredible park/garden! I was absolutely blown away by the views of Granada, the views of the snow-capped Sierra Nevada mountains, and the incredible gardens/walking paths/aqueduct/pond/etc on the enormous grounds. This is a truly spectacular and",

          "A park situated near to the Alhambra. Having been to the Alhambra twice, cost a lot and very crowded. We diverted into the Carmen de los martires. Beautiful park, fountains, water features, ducks, fish, pheasants...and all free. Very quiet and great for a picnic. Frankly nicer",

          "The area around Mirador de San Nicolas is perfect for some great views. We walked all the way up after wandering around the streets. It is a lovely location and the general area is quite beautiful. The walk up is definitely worth the effort.",
          "Good view, but crowded and a lot of drinking and smoking youngsters. Kinda it breaking the atmosphere.",
          "Go to this place for magnificent views over the Alhambra and Granada, you won\u2019t regret it, even better at sunset \ud83d\udc4d",
          "We were told this is the best view of the Alhambra but there are others and if you are there over a weekend at sunset it is too busy. Restaurants and pubs nearby also with views.",
          "You can drive up or take buses c - 31 and c- 32 from the center of town (1.40 one way - they run every 5 minutes). Make sure you arrive late afternoon for sunset and wait patiently until the sun is down and the Fort is all lighted up - and unbelievable view. Could not believe",
          "It is a hike to get there but worth it in every way. I have been there once in the day and this last time at night.... I recommend both",
          "This has to be the best view of the Alhambra in the whole of Granada; directly from the top of the Albaicin. I particularly enjoy it at night and if you can see it with a full moon hovering benignly over it, even better. It's always busy with street musicians and handmade",
          "If you visit Granada you can't miss this amazing view point. From here you can see the city, part of old town (Albaic\u00edn), Sierra Nevada, and the beautiful Alhambra Palace just in front of you! If you can, do it during the day but also at sunset, and even late at night! You won't",
          "Wonderful view of Alhambra and loved visiting and praying at the Mosque next door and relaxing in the mosque gardens.",
          "Walk up the hill to this wonderful vista of the city near sunset, and see the crowds, listen to live music, and soak up the vibes.",
          "It was a hike to get to this beautiful Mirador but it was certainly worth the hike! It offers a beautiful view of the Alhambra and a view of the city of Granada. Take your time and enjoy the shops and the view!",
          "Quite busy for an early evening in February. Quite a buzz with musicians and artists there,as well as tourists.",
          "It's a must visit place if in Granada; you can see the whole city and the Alhambra. There is couple of nice restaurants with terrace whici is worth while to spend a couple of ours and see the sunset over Granada and how the Alhambra comes alive at night.",
          "Great view of the city and Alhambra. We meandered up the neighborhood and ended up here. Definitely worth a stop. The views were beautiful. All of the city with Alhambra and snow capped Sierra Nevada as a back drop.",
          "The other best spot to picture the Alhambra is from the highest point while visiting it, from Generalife. To be explored the restaurants below to relax while enjoying the view, the sun and a great tinto de verano.",
          "Worth a visit on an evening Great view of the sunset across Granada & views of Alhambra lit up at night Lively atmosphere on an evening",
          "It is a gorgeous walk up to the Mirador. The view is spectacular but the hawkers have decided to take over all the benches. So there is no place to sit.",
          "We couldn't get tickets for the Alhambra so decided to go to this viewpoint. It's up hill all the way so wear sensible shoes. There are shops bars and restaurants along the way to stop off at if you need a rest. We went on Saturday just at sunset and it was crowded but the views",
          "This has great sight-lines for all of Grenada, the Alhambra, the surrounding countryside, and the Sierra Nevada range.",
          "This is worth the climb for an impressive view of the Alhambra. Arrive for lunch. There are good cafes nearby.",
          "Gosh, what a superb view from the old town in Granada! We trekked up here through the old town, not sure what we might find. The old town is alright - lots of narrow streets etc. Bit quirky etc. However, this wonderful viewpoint form the top of the old town is well worth the",
          "If you came all the way to Granada, \"La Alhambra\" is probably your main focus. So, after visiting the awesome palace complex, walk down to \"Plaza Nueva\" and then head to Granada's old Arab quarter - the romantic \"Albayzin\". After a nice and enlightening climbing (with many",
          "Beautiful place to finish the day, I recommend it to watch the sunset. Sometimes there are groups playing music so the atmosphere turns even more amazing.",
          "An excellent spot for taking in the views of the palace. We walked to here and it is a very pleasant walk. A great place to go to.",
          "This is a delightful place from which to view the Alhambra, the mountains in the background and views over Granada. You can catch a bus but the walk through the tiny laneways is delightful (just be sure you have moderate fitness and reasonable shoes). We did this as our first",
          "This stop is beautiful during the day, at sunset, and at night! We went multiple times, and it was absolutely beautiful! It can get crowded, but definitely worth it.",
          "Granada means Al-Hambra and this is the best spot to see it. You can reach here after a long but pleasant walk. So don't use the bus just walk. But it's little bit crowded.",
          "The view is heart-stopping. The ambience is unbelievable provided if you get to the terraced before 9am. After 9.30 the area is packed. People need to push their way to the front. It can get a bit chaotic.",
          "Superb views. We went on daylight and at night and views are spectacular at night. Long walk from our hotel in Santa Paula but worth it. Not a recommended walk for persons with health issues. But take a taxi. It drops you just in front of Mirador. Do not miss this at night",
          "We arrived here walking up hill in the morning, and it was a good workout. It was a nice experience. There are restaurants around, shops and it's fun to get lost between the narrow streets. Close by it is a path to the Alhambra which we took to climb to this unique gem. It's",
          "Go for the view; stay for the food or a drink. We had lunch, took photos, took in the area and headed back by city bus which added to the experience. All in all a very pleasant early afternoon.",
          "We took a taxi to the viewpoint in the morning due to time issues. Morning sun not so great for picture taking but still awesome view of the Alhambra.",
          "Albayzin is famous for its charming surroundings, cobbled streets, whitewashed houses and tapas bars. We walked along the little Albayzin streets and climbed up some steep steps leading to Mirador de San Nicolas located in the Albayzin neighbourhood for a spectacular view of",
          "I hate saying this because our last time up there was lovely, but this time the combination of smog ( not haze folk, it is smog ) masses of people, vendors laying wares on the ground so you trip on things, and so-so musicians blocking a large part of the wall, it was not a",
          "Mirador offers an exquisite view even though I expected to be even better. It is quite crowded but easily accessible and a nice place to take pictures, have a cup of coffee or buy some souvenirs.",
          "This is the place to visit to get the most fantastic view of the Alhambra and surrounding countryside including the Sierra Nevada. Well worth the hike up some steep roads.",
          "Arrived two hours before sunset to a packed terrace. At all times of the day this is a place to simply marvel at the sights of the Alhambra. Would suggest getting to the preferred area early and work your way in to a desired spot and stay and snap away. The views of the city",
          "Sunset came early in southern Spain in early November and we wanted to catch the view of the Alhambra from the St Nicholas viewpoint so we walked to the bus stop at Plaza Nueva and caught minibus C31 to Plaza San Nicolas (5.60 Euros for two seniors round trip). Fortunately we",
          "From here you have a great view towards the Alhambra complex and the Generalife. Especially the white peaks of the Sierra Nevada give an awesome picture.",
          "Fabulous views of the Alhambra but the area gets crowded so a bit of patience is needed before you get best view and photo opportunity.",
          "Everyone comes here for the same thing - the view of Alhambra with Sierra Nevada in the background. It is a lovely scene and worth a visit, but beware it\u2019s very popular and becomes overcrowded with tourists.",
          "Quite a hike up but you can catch the bus and then walk through the old town back. Bus goes from Plaza Neuva. This is, without a doubt, the best viewpoint, but check what time of day it is, because the light can be challenging for good shots, especially in winter.",
          "Even though it was crowded, it is a great viewpoint of the Alhambra. There are locals selling jewely and other things. The lighting was bad right after lunch so probably the best lighting for photography would be late afternoon. I`d try to find the same view without",
          "This was 2 mins from the place we were staying, so we got to see day and night views. Spectacular. And then seeing it as a landmark from Alhambra was wonderful as well.",
          "We arrived here with our Segway tour. Lots and lots of people trying to capture a view of the city below. The garden of the mosque nearby was a quiet haven and worth the little walk.",
          "Allegedly the most beautiful view towards Alhambra from Granada. It is a short walk uphill and always crowded. I actually enjoyed the view from the Cuevas museum in Sacromonte more. At least it was more peaceful.",
          "Taking the bus up was easy, although crowded. If you want the party atmosphere go to the San Nicolas. If you want a quieter, more introspective time waiting for the sunset, go to the Mosque's garden next door.",
          "Easy walk up the the lookout plaza in front of the church. A few restaurants right on the edge with spectacular views available too. It\u2019s the best spot to get a great overall view of the Alhambra and snow peaked mountains in the distance.",
          "Amazing viewpoint and best to go at sunset. We went on a Friday evening during a holiday....it was too full of ppl at that time.",
          "As i stated \"Best spot to view the Alhambra\" the panoramic is unique with the Sierra Nevada on the back with a incredible clear blue sky . Plus the walk through the Albayzin enchanting",
          "We arrived on the number 31 bus, which we picked up in Gran Via, and for the princely sum of \u20ac1.40 were dropped at the bottom of the short flight of steps leading up to the Mirador. Later we bought a city bus pass, from one of the grey machines by numerous bus stops throughout",
          "We went on a drizzly day. Its an open space so its open all the time. On our app it showed only a few hundred meters to the mirador. What the app doesn\u2019t tell you is how steep and slippery the cobbled stones are when wet. It was well worth the effort for the breathtaking views",
          "The view is worthy. The only problem the horrible flamenco singers hahahahha but it is very nice to walk up through the Andalusian narrow streets. It is recommended to go during the day or for the sunset but not at night because of pickpockets.",
          "Great views of Alhambra and Sierra Nevada. Gets busy and is a haven for buskers looking money. Better option for peace and tranquillity is the mosque gardens adjacent. Buy a mint tea from the mosque volunteers and relax",
          "The path to get there walkinh is a bit hard, specially if you are going with kids or older people, but totally worth it!!",
          "It is a long walk from the city centre, up narrow streets and alleyways, but once you get there, you understand that it was worth it. The view is absolutely beautiful. With nice bars, it's not even that arduous!",
          "Ohh mine... tis is one of the best views on Granada, you must be there around sunset, having the sun shining over the walls of the La Alhambra and the lights on the castle is really breath taking, if you add that lots of people gather there the ambience is really festive as they",
          "Magical views of the Alhambra (at any time). You can either walk up and explore the Albaicin or take bus 31. Come before sunset, stake out a spot on the wall and enjoy the show!",
          "The views just after sunset when the Alhambra is lit up are fantastic. While it was quite cold when I was there in mid-November the world class views made the trip up worth it.",
          "some of the most beautiful places are most beautiful from a distance, like the city of Carcasson take a cab up hill and enjoy an amazing view",
          "This is one of the typical sights of Granada; the Alhambra from the old city with the snow-covered peaks in the background. Worth the climb through the charismatic streets of the old town.",
          "From the Moorish ghetto on the hillside facing the Alhambra, one is afforded a comprehensive view of the majestic setting of the palace/fortress. We were immediately impressed by the strategic importance of the citadel as well as the statement of power to anyone entering the",
          "Visiting this Mirador is essential when you\u2019re in Granada. It\u2019s a lovely walk up from the centre through the cobbled streets of the Albaic\u00edn district. The view of the Alhambra is truly spectacular but it\u2019s very busy. Pop into the gardens of the nearby mosque and you\u2019ll get an",
          "Just the best thing to do following a day in the Alhambra is to head up here just before sunset and witness one of the most incredible views of your life! I came up here with my 26 Yr old son and we had just the best time ever before heading back down into town... Do not miss",
          "I visited jere during the city walking tour. You could get a good view of the city, and good place to take photos. There are some cafe nearby you could refresh",
          "You will have a great view of the Alhambra here. It's crowded with many tourists getting the pictures taken. There is a bus getting to here but you can also hike up as well. Getting down is not that hard and gets to enjoy the street views of the area.",
          "Nice square to see the \"Old Town\" from a distance point of view, very crowded, music, stalls, market. Pretty tough walking up the hill but it's worth it!",
          "All of the Albayzin is so wonderful to walk through. Unfortunately, as with every city you visit, you have to ignore and look beyond the ubiquitous graffiti. The walk is a bit steep but there's no need to rush. Take time to appreciate the handiwork, chat with a shop owner,",
          "A lovely place on top of \u00c9l Albaicin quarter, the oldest of Granada that is a must visit. Do not miss the Archivo Hist\u00f3rico de Granada and its luscious gardens on your way to the Miredor.",
          "We timed our wanderings through the Albayzin to end up at this Mirador a little before sunset. The views of the Alhambra, as we'd read, were indeed amazing, with the setting sun adding interesting colors to the scene. The small plaza area was very crowded, with those looking at",
          "What a discovery thanks to our friend and guide Jorge! Superb hang out. Visit the mosque up here and get a penny pressed with the Al Hambra on it! Fab mint tea and local biscuits for as well at the entry to the mosque.",
          "We saw the sunset from here, but actually there is a better view around the corner, where our guided tour ended :-) It is really crowded.",
          "Worth the cab ride or challenging walk up. Great views of the city and the Alhambra. Great area to wander the streets. Note the church is not open to the public.",
          "We did the tourist thing and WALKED all the way up through the Albacian which was actually really lovely but quite hard going for an old girl. When we got to the Mirador we could hardly move for other visitors. There are several marble seats but they are covered in tat that is",
          "Have a seat, enjoy the live music and the views. Great for sunset! You'll enjoy the walk here and back (wouldn't recommend driving here as the roads are very narrow.",
          "It is a long trek up cobbled streets to get there but I think you can get a bus. The views are amazing but it can be very crowded. There is very little seating except along the wall but then you have your back to the view!",
          "This is real tourist hot spot, so it gets busy, but that also means it has a great atmosphere. I'd got the city tourist bus to Mirador de San Cristobal and then walked the 5 minutes or so to here. The view here was slightly better and you get a much clearer view of the Sierra",
          "A must visit in the evening to see the sunset. Atmosphere is just brilliant. Nice cafes and bars to have a drink.",
          "The views of the Alhambra and Granada are well worth the climb. It\u2019s a bit of a tourist hotspot but not disastrously so (we were there at 3pm at the end of October). While you\u2019re in the area be sure to walk around the Albaicin part of town. Very \u2018traditional\u2019 Andalusian",
          "Nice view, but a way better one on up at the top at San Miguel! Take the bus up and walk down - if you can figure out which one! Buses changed routes three times lately so ALWAYS ask before you get on where it is going!",
          "The Moorish quarter is fun to walk through, the viewpoint is great, the atmosphere is enchanting. During your walk it looks like you ended up in the soukhs of Cairo! The arab shops and language, the smell of spices. Great fun.",
          "It has a nice view for Alhambra, but remember to go in the afternoon, not in the morning, because it is hard to take pictures if the light is in the right direction. I went there around 11am, it is not clear enough to see the Palace.",
          "This view point is always busy, doesn't matter when you go there. Artists, musicians, tourists create an atmosphere you can hardly find somewhere else in the city. If you want to take pictures of the Alhambra it's a good spot, but it won't be easy.",
          "This location has fantastic panoramic views of Granada and Alhambra. There are a few restaurants nearby that have a nice atmosphere.",
          "Another great view of the Granda AND the Alhambra after a bit of a hike up hill. You can take a bus part of the way but walking is a much better experience and gives you a real feel for the city. Views are breath taking. Very glad we did it. Walked back to the city centre",
          "Well worth the climb up through the Albaicin to take pictures from this view of the Alhambra and to enjoy ad hoc flamenco guitarists and singers while you watch the sunset. Not to be missed.",
          "For fabulous views of La Alhambra and the city, but without the march to the top of the city (which is a significant one), the Mirador do San Nicolas is excellent. It is busy at all times, but if you would like to take in the vista and the obligatory selfie without being",
          "A must go to to see the sunset. You Can see all of granada from this location.Bring A bottle of water if you are planning in walking there.",
          "The Mirador is not far from center of town. You can walk up or take the bus. The square is lively with venders and performers. At sunset it is packed. If you are not into large crowds, go during the day to enjoy the view.",
          "We wandered up away from the tourist shops and happened upon this great little hamlet with fantastic little streets some of which were traffic free. Overlooking Alhambra and offering a variety of fabulous views",
          "Yes, the sunset doesn't happen above the Alhambra as is a myth and stories made by so many. The place attracts a lot of crowd which makes the environment very happening. But if you want to see the real sunset, please go to San Miguel Alto for the best views.",
          "This small square(plaza) offer wonderful views of the Alhambra, so not to surprised as to how crowded it was bug the atmosphere was very good.",
          "The San Nicolas has the best view to the Alhambra and the Albayzin. Easily reachable by bus. It worth a visit both during the day and at night.",
          "I would strongly recommend a visit. The Alhambra both in day and at dusk produced great photos. It gets busy at dusk. Lots of restaurants and bars nearby. A super area of Granada",
          "Located at the top of the Albaicin, this plaza gives superb view of the Alhambra. When we were there it was very busy and surprisingly apart from the wall at the edge there was nowhere to sit! There was however a delightful restaurant just below the wall also with a splendid",
          "Don't miss Mirador de San Nicolas if you are fond of photography and the beauty of old architecture! A couple of years ago, in the middle of winter, I visited the place at sunrise and found myself virtually alone over there. This time, I went to the Mirador at sunset, and was",
          "This place is definitely overrated. First thing you see there after you arrive are the backs of people lining up the edge of the square trying to take pictures of Alhambra. You can see the castle from many places in Albayz\u00edn. Yes, probable the view from San Nicol\u00e1s is better but",
          "This is the best spot in Granada to watch the sunset and see the Alhambra at night. Come a bit early because it gets crowded.",
          "Took the bus which was free if you have the Granada pass. . This place is crowded with people selling from paintings to jewelry. Finding a good spot will be difficult if you are there at the time of sunset. The view of Alhambra and the city is breath taking",
          "While in Granada we walk from Paseo de los Tristes to Mirador de San Nicol\u00e1s, it was quite a walk but well worth it.there was a group of musicians singing flamenco songs And a lot a people watching and listening, but the view was spectacular!",
          "It is important to go to the mirador at the end of the day to see the sun setting over the Alhambra and the city. It is a vibrant place, full of people doing just the same as you, there are locals playing guitars and clapping.",
          "I visited st Nicolas viewpoint in a very hot Sep Saturday afternoon. It was very crowded including vendors of various trinkets. You can see Alhambra walls from the viewpoint - but there are some other viewpoints to see Granada so I was not that much impressed. There were also",
          "This photo was taken early morning so not many tourists around. Went back in the evening for sunset and the place was rammed, 10 or more deep. We got dropped off right into the square by taxi for around \u20ac5,. Still a great experience as there are stalls and musicians making for a",
          "A plaza where people of various ages gather. The view of the Alhambra was lovely. Buskers were entertaining the crowd. There were taverns around the plaza. Nice atmosphere.",
          "My wife gives it 5 out of 5. Glad we found which bus took us there. The view was stunning, the drive through the back streets an experience and the walk down gave you a feel for the place eventually coming out to the restaurants by the river. Not to be missed.",
          "Must see for sunset views of Alhambra. Lots of crowds but worth it. A hilly uphill walk so be sure to have good walking shoes.",
          "wonderful place to visit at sunset to enjoy the sights of the city and the surrounding area as the sun goes down. Becomes very busy in the build up to sunset, we arrived 30 minutes early to get a good location to enjoy the experience",
          "I've been visiting Granada for 13 years, and Mirador de San Nicol\u00e1s has always been one of my favorite spots for a view of the Alhambra. Unfortunately, on the latest trip, it was packed with tourists (most in large guided groups) and had lost its laid-back atmosphere. May be",
          "It's definitely worth a trip to Mirador de San Nicolas when you're in Granada. The main square is usually buzzing with life and atmosphere and the views over the city are awesome.",
          "Big walk up but absolutely worth it! Magnificent views of Granada and the Alhambra. Make sure you get to the top",
          "Great views of the Alhambra and the city. I visited at sunset and the views were spectacular. Hardly a hidden gem though as it was packed but definitely worth the visit.",
          "Most amazing views of Alhambra Palace. Uiu can catch a minibus up here from the plaza nueva- recommended as a steep climb otherwise better to walk down!!!- through the narrow streets of Albaizin and the selection of Moroccan shops and restuarants. A walk around the the area",
          "This is one of Granada\u2019s best known \u2018secrets\u2019 and fits wonderfully with a visit to the Alhambra. For the best views try to go in the evening or early morning.",
          "Well worth the walk up just to see the area as you go, clean, safe, and beautiful. View is amazing, especially at night. Plenty of people selling you things but not pushy. Listened for ages to 2 guitarists playing together, totally sensational.",
          "Well worth going up up to the Mirador de San Nicolas for the amazing views. We also had a lovely lunch in the restaurant at the side of the square.",
          "If you visit Granada you must come up to San Nicol\u00e1s and enjoy one of the best views you will ever see. The sight of the Alhambra Palace is just amazing from there. The area is lovely to walk around with some really lovely bars and restaurants. Enjoy!",
          "The best place to have a perfect view of the Alhambra, wille you enjoy a delicious meal and a nice glass you Spanish wine. Highly recommend you go to mirador de san Nicol\u00e1s at night !",
          "Large crowds gather at this spot below the whitewashed church of st nicholas. A railed walkway and square behind offers a vantage point with views of Alhambra. As the place is about 40mon uphill walk from the darro river it's a favourite spot for tourists and locals to gather at",
          "Beautiful view of Alhambra at night. Also fun locals playing guitar. It does get quite crowded, however.",
          "We visited late in the afternoon, it wasn\u2018t very crowded yet. Then went for some tapas just down from there, and walked back up for sunset. At this time it does get extremely crowded, but it\u2018s a peaceful gathering and great for people watching. We took a taxi up, and walked",
          "This mirador provides the Alhambra views you dream about. The Alhambra is framed perfectly, with green trees in the foreground and the Sierra Mountains in the background. Late afternoon and sunset are the best viewing times.",
          "It's all about the location location the time. Went at 1800hrs and again at 0745hrs the next day. Stunning vista and worth the trip up. Early was best for picture talking and soaking in the views in the peace and quiet.",
          "Well worth it. You can take a bus or get a taxi but my friend and I like the challenge of finding out of the way places. The square itself is quite small and there were a few sellers selling souvenirs and even some painters painting the Alhambra! We went in the afternoon and",
          "We almost missed this Mirador when staying in Granada but the views of the Alhambra were amazing from here - there was a little market there on Sunday too and it does get very busy around sunset time but definitely worth a visit",
          "Great view of Alhambra. Expensive restaurants serving average food though. The streets of Albaicin leading up to it are one of a kind. Beautiful architecture.",
          "In the beautiful area of Albaycin with its narrows streets and white houses is the Mirador de San Nicolas; well worth a 10 Euro taxi ride otherwise a very steep 30 to 40 minutes walk! A few bars and restaurants are close by for a drinks or tapas!",
          "30 minute hike though but you can see the shops along the way and enjoy the views. Lots of people taking photos. You can take a taxi or bus up but walk is enjoyable.",
          "Found the views from the nearby mosque of Granada (the small gardens are open to respectful visitors) to be just as good, and not nearly as crowded.",
          "Granada has many miradors - or vista points. We went to this one as we were taken then en route to a flamenco show. The views were spectacular. And the colors at sunset were gorgeous. Truly remarkable.",
          "Take bus c30 or 32 to get up the narrow windy road up the hill, from city center adjacent to the fountain. Walking back down to town was swift and easy. The view from afar is must ... as this is the only location where one can see the entire palace of the Alhambra.",
          "At the top of the Albayzin area this pretty little square has walls & space to sit/stand & admire a clear panoramic view of the stunning Alhambra. Obviously it gets more crowded in the evening but all is very civilised. In the daytime there are 1 or 2 buskers but again nothing",
          "We walked from our hotel, near centre. A lot of uphill steps, but took our time. Really hot in early September. Check the map,as there are many interesting stops on way to top. Little squares open up here and there. Churches might be open for you to have a look. Just look around",
          "We happened to be at this lookout close to sunset and there were plenty of people around to see it. It's not the prettiest view of the city but a good overview.",
          "Definitely the best lookout to catch entire structure of Alhambra at one photo and prime spot for a sunset with majestic view over the most popular attraction of the city and gorgeous mountain range in the background. It gets incredibly crowded in late afternoon.",
          "Absolutely worth the trek (or bus!) up the hill to see the breathtaking view over the Alhambra and the city.",
          "Nice to visit and make some beautiful pictures. Perfect to eat at nearby restaurant, drink some summer wine, enjoying the view.",
          "We had a blast taking photos- while it was definitely crowded, watching the sunset was gorgeous. There were folks playing guitar and singing, and somehow it was just perfect.",
          "This is the place to go to view the Alhambra at sunset. Get there early to find a spot! It is very crowded. There are a few restaurants with a view but you need to arrive well before sunset to get a seat.",
          "We took the little red minibus number 32 or 34 to the Mirador stop. Note it is not very obvious of a stop so be on the lookout for it. We stopped into the restaurant just under the walls called Restaurante El Balcon de San Nicholas. It has umbrellas which are needed in summer",
          "Amazing views of the Alhambra! We went at around 8:30pm and was pretty busy. Wear comfy shoes as its a bit of a trek (mostly all uphill on cobbled streets), however there is a bus and taxi option too. Definitely worth a visit!!",
          "Wonderful view of Granada The church is stunning well worth the visit. We took the hop on hop off train excellent value at \u20ac8 for all day",
          "We walked up from the city and visited about 11.00 am when there were few people. Great views of the Alhambra, a nice cafe nearby. It was great to explore the small streets, with interesting spots and lots of photo opportunities.",
          "Excellent for beautiful views of Granada and to see Albaicin neighborhood. My guide at Alhambra recommended this. You get views, you can see a mosque there, and there are restaurants.Instead of walking, I took a cab up, saw the beautiful views and then walked down through",
          "Especially if you walked up till here in the summer heat, the reward of this view is very sweet and gives you a nice view on the complete site of Alhambra and generalife.",
          "The walk to get there was comfortable. Small hill, but with a road to get there. You can also hire a taxi. The view is worth it.",
          "Great views for great photos! I recommend you take a taxi going up, unless you are super fit and want to be sweaty when you get up\ud83e\udd2a",
          "This is the most beautiful place to view the magic of the Alhambra and the city of Granada with the high Sierra Nevada Mountains as the backdrop. It is like being on a magic carpet and overlooking these sites. But not only for the views, this is a lively place where people",
          "If you don't fancy climbing the hill to get here, there is a C32 bus from town centre that takes you there. The view of the Alhambra from outside the church is one of the best you'll get. The \"square\" is lively especially at night and there are restaurants/bars around both",
          "This is a very nice place to view Granada though in the evening there are so many people you cannot even see out. Go early. Still a lovely view without the crowds. I would also recommend getting the bus there as getting to it involves a lot of walking of hills.",
          "After visiting the Alhambra we walked to the Mirador to get a flavour of Albaic\u00edn and to see the sun set on the Alhambra. It\u2019s a great place for the views. There\u2019s not much shade if you are there early. The bars & restaurants seem to be more pricey as the place is full of",
          "Walking up the stairs and turning the corner to see the Alhambra for the first time had me literally saying: \"Oh my gosh... wow\". This is a must-see while you are in Granada, and the best time is at sunset. The Alhambra is literally glowing in the light of the setting sun and",
          "For our first view of the Alhambra, we decided to go to the Mirador. Despite waiting until late afternoon, it was still very warm. And that walk is steep - and long - and hot! I was okay but teenage daughters were unhappy in the extreme and I incurred the wrath of a 13 year old",
          "A beautiful picturesque square that highlights the beauty of Granada. There are wonderful panoramic views that are great to see across the city. Tourists and locals alike flock to this peaceful location. Alongside the square is a restaurant for refreshments and you may hear",
          "I walked up to the Mirador de San Nicolas in the early afternoon and there were minimal people. Took in the great view and got my photos without the crowd. Didn't stop at the restaurants although looked like a good place for a refreshing drink. For me the walk up to and down",
          "This was a beautiful viewpoint overlooking The Alhambra and the city of Granada. There are many tourists here, so if you want to watch the sunset from here, I recommend grabbing your bottle of wine and heading up earlier.",
          "In brief, what a fantastic viewpoint to see the Alhambra Palaces and Citadel from. Our host recommended it and in truth we stumbled across it after taking a wrong turn whilst wandering through the Albaycin quarter, an easy thing to do. For a display of the changing colours of",
          "This is a great spot to get a view of La Alhambra. We were staying in a hotel near the river Darro, so it was quite the hike up through the Albaicin for us. It was a little confusing to get there, but once we did, the view was incredible and 100% worth the hike. It was crowded,",
          "Like any classic viewpoint, it is busy but worth the walk up the hill to take a good pic, a couple of a average cafes nearby for a cooling drink and a few traders in the square selling tat.",
          "You\u00b4re in Granada? Don\u00b4t wait any longer and visit this beautiful place to have a meal that you\u00b4ll remember for a long time. Everyone will find something to eat: from salads to vines and ice cream, from assortment of fish to pork loin or steaks. It\u00b4s unacceptable to visit the",
          "We walked from the Granada centre up to Mirador de San Nicolas in the early evening to see the sunset and then have a well earned gin and tonic. Fantastic views of the Alhambra and a lovely peaceful place to sit and drink.",
          "You can walk up rhe mountain or simply take a taxi to enjoy this breathe taking views. Or visit a restaurant and have sundowners .",
          "My girlfriend and I came here in August - the hike up was in the late afternoon and was very hot but not unbearable. We hiked up from the foot of the hill through the quaint villagehouses which I argue is an important part of this experience. Once we arrived at the top, we were",
          "I definitely recommend walking up to the views of San Nicolas at sunset when the lights of Alhambra come on! You can take a taxi up if it is too much walking but an easy walk down and stop at Paseo de los Tristes for a drink, dinner or dessert. We went to La Bella y La Bestia",
          "We got to the Albaicin area walking up to the top reaching the Mirador of San Nicolas, twice. One time in the day time and the other at night, and it is so well worth it! I recommend taking a cab instead if you are not up for the walk through the steep hills and climbing many,",
          "We went there as part of our walking tour bit was very crowded. The view is good but our guide showed us far better and quotes places for the view. Go for the trek as it's the highest point in Granada but look for better view along the way rather than on the top.",
          "Beautiful viewpoint in Albaicin from which you get the best view to Alhambra. If you go during the summer, take a lot of water, as it gets extremely hot on the way.",
          "Don\u2019t miss the opportunity to admire The Alhambra from here at sunset! What a view of a majestic place! You can also dine around here.",
          "Caught the C32 bus, which takes you near the area. Great views of the Alhambra, especially as the sun is dropping.",
          "You absolutely have to see the Alambra from this viewpoint it was one of the most special moments of my trip to Granada watching the Alambra light up in the sunset was spectacular everybody was happy singing dancing playing the drums eating drinking the atmosphere was incredible",
          "This lookout point has a great view but is too crowded to spend more then 5 mins at. Worth walking by, but not going out of your way to get to.",
          "Great place for views of Alhambra. We went right before sunset and it was very crowded. We were told to mind our valuables and placed our bags in front of us. I would not walk up to this view point with a pair of flip flops:)",
          "Although it is a place with nice view of the city - no doubt about that - and a beautiful mosque installation, it is confuse, crowded.",
          "Great views. But a lot of people so be very watchful on your belongings. Good walking up hill if funcy to absorb the architecture around. Best time to go is just before the sunset.",
          "Good views if you can find a spot at the front. Otherwise there are other places with a view of the Alhambra",
          "Nice view of the sunset and Alhambra. After all day of going around Alhambra, someone told me to visit mirador de san nicolas to see alhambra being lit up at night and it was indeed very lovely",
          "We staked our spot and enjoyed the view across the Albayzin and the Darro River to the Alhambra until the the sunset turned the Alhambra to a golden color.",
          "This is where you go to get that Christmas card worthy photo with the Alhambra in the background. Surrounded by great restaurants with spectacular views.",
          "Can get crowded but worth the trip up. Catch the 32 bus and save your legs. Hopefully you will see the artist up there that does amazing sketches on a easel that has a horn for a stand.",
          "We walked from the Alhambra at about 19:30, winding our way through the quaint streets and up alleys and stairways, along with a few other tourists looking for signs of which direction to go. Fortunately we used our navigation set for walking, as we would never have found it",
          "The area is interesting without feeling unsafe, quite happy walking up the hills and glad I took a taxi back as it's seriously hilly. The views are genuinely spectacular. Lots of tourists. Lots of crusties, beggars, alcoholics, sellers of herbal cigarettes, with cheap and",
          "If you prefer to eat your own sandwich, and want to skip the restaurants -or are just out for a walk in Granada, make sure to go the plaza: It comes with a climb, but the view is well worth it!",
          "This is one of the best spots to take pictures of Alhambra ....lovely views in the evening also...walk around and get lost in the lanes of this area...enjoy the music made by some locals in this area..carry your bottle of water and / or a snack...",
          "Small plaza that is crowded with folks gazing at The Alhambra. Not so crowded, however, that you couldn\u2019t get great views and pictures. Limited taxis available when departing the plaza.",
          "After a lovely stroll up through Albaicin this is the perfect place to catch some sunshine and take in the Alhambra.",
          "You get a great view of the Alhambra from the outside. Go as the sunsets around 9pm as you can get a view with the sun and also once all the lights turn on at the Alhambra. Buses operate well past 11pm so transportation from the Plaza Nueva will not be an issue.",
          "Nice views but expect to be sharing it with lots of people. We did a free walking tour and the guide showed us several other spots nearby with just as nice views but without the crowds.",
          "Worth the trip to the other side of the Darro, be sure to stop for a visit to this spot for not only amazing views of the Alhambra, but all of Grenada as well. Especially captivating as the sun sets and watching the lights come on at the Alhambra. Beware... tourists aplenty and",
          "This lookout provides an excellent view of the Alhambra with the mountains in the distance. Plan on walking uphill on cobblestones to reach the square. There are lots of food and drink options in the area.",
          "It is a nice place and a good opportunity to spend some time in the old neighborhood. Keep in mind that it could take about 15 mins walking time from the cathedral. There is a bus option too but we didn\u2019t try it.",
          "On the way up to the mirador we did get lost but finally after discovering more eateries and shops than you can imagine, up popped the Mirador with its impressive nighttime views of the Alhambra - lit at night. Felt totally comfortable at night and in the constricted alleyways",
          "A great view of the Alhambra. Friendly tourists, locals playing guitar, sometimes singing. Wonderful",
          "Its a long walk up here thru Albaizin or you can get the mini bus up from Plaza Nueva and walk down ! Amazing views of the city and Alhambra palace- in daylight and at night when the palace is floodlit. There are usually some flamenco guitarists and dancers and singers busking",
          "Lively place with the most beautiful views of Alhambra and the city. Very lively with people taking photos and the day we went there were locals playing Spanish Guitar and singing.",
          "It's a decent uphill climb from the centre of the city. It's much easier to get the bus up and walk down again. We found out the hard way. The view is amazing if you can see past The crowds. The restaurants behind the walls across the road in front of the lookout were",
          "This is a \u201cplaza\u201d where you can see the beautiful Alhambra and take amazing photos. There is also in the plaza a hippie fair where you can buy some earrings, paintings, all handmade. The way to get there is beautiful, surrounded by the Albaic\u00edn typical houses.",
          "This viewpoint is certainly picturesque with its unobstructed Alhambra view, but can be quite crowded. Jockey for a photo op spot at the wall, swap cameras with strangers to get that romantic photo. Several pricey tourist cafes nearby. Always someone playing music or selling",
          "A short walk up to a commanding lookout toward the Alhambra. Easily reached from the town center and the Plaza Neuva and/or Catedral. We enjoyed dangling our legs over the wall while people watching. Best on a bright, cool day, but I can see why this is a favorite of locals at",
          "We walked up to this viewpoint and loved it. It was very busy there is a small bus that goes up there as well. The views are great. Well worth a visit to roam around the narrow streets and sample the many eating places close by.",
          "After visiting the Alhambra walk down into the Plaza Nueva and catch the C32 minibus and ask the driver to give you a shout at the Albaicin and St Nicholas. Takes about 5 minutes to get there and the views of the Alhambra are tremendous. From this point we walked back downhill",
          "Incredible panoramic view of the Alhambra and the snow-capped Sierra Nevada Mountains from the other side of the valley. Well worth the walk up or take a taxi if you can't do the walk--it's like another world!",
          "The signs indicating the way to the Mirador de San Nicolas are almost missing, and I found it by trial and error. The view over the city of Granada and over the Alhambra from Mirador the San Nicolas is amazing, but the mirador itself was flooded with sellers of cheap tourist",
          "Have visited before on previous stay in Granada but would come back again & again for this amazing view. Walked up this time & although a little bit of a climb worth it for all the lovely areas you pass through.",
          "Beautiful views, especially during the day - panorama over the Alhambra and the whole city of Granada, with the Sierra Nevada mountains in the background. Would recommend Mirador de San Miguel Alto for a sunset at night.",
          "Great place to enjoy the romantic layout of the city below. The walk up to the mirador is also very enjoyable",
          "must visit this place to take photo for this beautiful Al Hambra. Also a beautiful mosque close by Granada mosque. 45mins is the time needed to stay there. I recommend people with heart issues or over weight to take a cab/ car to this place.",
          "We just went there during the sunset and we really appreciate the gipsy atmosphere. The panorama is amazing. You can see from there all the city center and the Alhambra.",
          "Well worth the walk up hill. The view is incredible and numerous bars are waiting at the hilltop to offer you an irreplaceable experience of a drink with a view of the Alhambra.",
          "Perfeckt view! Till you enjoy in view ,there is lot off street artists around you ,like example Spanish street musicians! For more information check my Instagram profil! __goran_p_",
          "Walk up here before sunset and watch Alhambra live up to its reputation as 'the red'. There is also a bus, but the walk is much better. There are restaurants nearby for dinner, too.",
          "Worth the hike up the hill but you can also take a bus. The best time to go is in the evening as the sun is setting and casts a glow on the Alhambra. You can see the Sierra Nevada in the background.",
          "Very popular and thus very busy with tourists and hawkers. Good views towards Alhambra. Be aware of pick-pockets.",
          "Definitely a place to go if you want a panoramic view of La Alhambra and the city below. Have some nice looking restaurants around and a killer ice cream shop that you should definitely try.",
          "The walk is nice as well as the view. We enjoyed the markets and music at the top and the characteristic shops and teterias.",
          "Wander through Albayzin to the top for a great view. Sunset must be wonderful though we were there on a rainy period. Lots of crowds from busses, but in between times are great.",
          "In our minds this was just one of our options but we are very glad that we did go. We are seniors of dubious fitness but easily managed to walk up, although there are transport options. The views are fabulous as others describe and it\u2019s a lovely spot to sit and take it all in.",
          "Wonderful place to see the Alhambra at sunset , before te lights highlight this piece of magnificent architecture. Yes a few people about , but pop into the many restaurants that are in the same area , for a drink complimentary tapas ,,, and get away from the crowd ....",
          "Beautiful view of the Alhambra with cute little cafes to have a drink after the long climb up. Most days, you can take a cab up to see it.",
          "Yes there is a great view here La Alhambra, but it is crowded, noisy, and full of vendors. There is a nice view from the Mosque next door without the noise, and several vantage points in the Albaicin that are just as nice, and often deserted.",
          "This takes a bit of a walk but there are panoramic views of the entire area and it is well worth the time.",
          "It takes a bit of a trek to get here, but the incomparable views of the Alhambra make every step worth it. During the day, artists sell their wares and musicians provide a lovely backdrop.",
          "We visited several viewpoints during our stay in Granada, this was by far the best - you get a full on view of the Alhambra. Absolutely beautiful and worth the walk!",
          "...for evening and sunset views of the Alhambra palace. Very popular and a steep walk. This is quite a big plaza type area where I can imagine people taking picnics in the summer. Well worth the climb from the old town. There are some overpriced tavernas where you can stop a",
          "Great views with an artisan market in the square. A few good restaurants close by providing drinks and good meals.",
          "San Nicholas square in the Albaicin is a must particularly for it's photo opportunity. It is from here that for me the most famous photos of the Alhambra Palace are taken as it includes the snow capped Sierra Nevada as a backdrop.",
          "Great view over the city and Alhambra but very busy on the evening we were there. Very worthwhile walk up through Albaycin to get the panoramic views.",

          "Visited here at sunset and at night and the views of the Alhambra were beautiful, but the plaza was so busy that it was difficult to get good photos. We found a better spot for pics a couple of streets below the Mirador on Placeta Comino.",
          "The Albaycin neighborhood in Granada is one of the oldest and most culturally rich to be found. You can take a bus to get to the top, but walking gives you the opportunity for a closer look at the houses, shops, and the people, and rewards you when you get to the top and Pla\u00e7a",
          "Great views and fantastic squares with restaurants which serve authentic tapas with every drink. Great to wander around the little cobble streets and explore. Always something else to see round another corner, some lovely little boutique shops and some traditional Spanish shops.",
          "The breathtaking views across to the Alhambra are not to be missed, the snow covered peaks of the Sierra Nevada ( March) behind. It needs to be seen both during the day , making sure you avoid the steep climb in the heat of the day, and in the evening as the light begins to fade",
          "I came a few times. Once mid-day and it was full of tourists and vendors alike. Then again with just my boyfriend early in the morning. It was much more enjoyable with less people but if you\u2019re looking to take a great picture, the morning sunlight doesn\u2019t exactly provide the",
          "You just found a haven for selfie takers - kill time trying to get a shot without a crowd in it. Then wait as your disappointment grows. You won't be alone. Everyone seems to be sitting around waiting for something to happen and nothing ever does. There are street musicians, but",
          "Magical but always crowded with lively tourists, unfortunately, which kind of dampers the magic. That being said, it is a place when one can gaze on the splendor that is the Alhambra, in all its eerie and surreal grandeur.",
          "It really worth climbing up to the viewpoint. The view to the Alhambra and overlooking Granada is a must on this stop. Local artesanato is sold there and also the mix between tourists and locals create a good vibe.",
          "This is basically a viewpoint for the Alhambra. The entire Alhambra complex with the Sierra Nevada mountains in the background makes the perfect photo. We also experienced great spring sun, youngsters performing musicals, artists preparing and selling paintings and of course",
          "Day or night, this viewpoint is the best to admire the Alhambra. During the day there are flamenco guitarists, singers and dancers to enchant the audience, also gypsies and artists. Lovely vibe!",
          "Exhausting hike to get there but well worth the effort - the whole meal was excellent. Not cheap but friendly staff, great views and for the quality of the food still good value.",
          "Really worth a visit at sunset to see the colours of the stone built Alhambra and the mountains change as the sun sets",
          "We went to this lookout point during the day time because it certainly does have an awesome view of the alhambra and the Sierra Nevada, however by sunset it is so uncomfortably jam packed with tourists that you won\u2019t be able to get decent pictures. Instead, you should be able to",
          "If you go to Granada, first you can go to The Alhambra, after that to Mirador de San Nicolas to see The Alhambra from the other side, nice restaurants, all walkable.",
          "We happened upon this overlook. You can see Alhambra from this site and the Sierra Nevada mountains. So incredibly beautiful.",
          "Walked up through the Albaicin district of the city - a fairly steep but interesting walk which took about 20 minutes although we weren\u2019t rushing. We visited at about 12pm on. Thursday and we were expecting huge crowds from the reviews that we had read but we were able to walk",
          "Great view that shows the Palace Of al Hambra , great to visit at night too that gives the rosen view of the Palace .",
          "It really isn't difficult to find, yes there are a lot of narrow streets and stairs to negotiate but if you keep heading up you cant go too far wrong. The square was very busy but it was a nice hustle and bustle, I could imagine it is somewhere you might want to keep an eye on",
          "It was a tough walk to get to this location but worth it for the fantastic view of Alhambra - and tour through Albaycin. Try to get there at sunset for a really spectacular view.",
          "This is a decent walking climb and you will need either a fantastic map and/or a Google Maps app to help you with the narrow streets. There is no grid system here. Once you make it to the top you have a fantastic view of Alhambra and the surrounding city. It is free.",
          "Yes this lookout is super touristy and heavily populated. But you can\u2019t miss it! Seriously so beautiful, especially with the snowy mountains you can see behind the Alhambra.",
          "My first place to go on arrival in Granada. Alhambra right in front of you in all its majesty. I walked around and discovered the area, so much history. Albayazin is enchanting!",

          "when you want to see alhambra and the city of granada at sunset, this is the place to visit. only problem is that the place is very crowded, so it'd be better to be there earlier.",
          "This is a very crowdy and touristic place in Granada, especially during the evening hours. You can Always enjoy some live \"flamenco\" music.",
          "I found this the best outlook to see the Alhambra complex, but also to see the city of Granada and surrounding hills. Must visit when in Granada!",
          "A demanding walk uphill on the narrow cobbled streets, brings you out into teh most captivating of views across the Alhambra, with a backdrop of the Sierra Nevada mountains was breathtaking. Be warned though, it is a steep walk up and roads are too narrow for most cars.",
          "The plaza in front of San Nicolas is crowded at sunset with craft vendors, musicians, and people waiting to watch the sun set over the city laid out below, and the magnificent Alhambra castle across the river valley. The view is beautiful; and while the walk up from the center",
          "The Mirador de San Nicolas is a decent sized plaza but it is very busy around sunset and it may be difficult to get a view. There are vendors in the plaza with wares laid out on blankets and musicians playing and singing, which can add to the atmosphere but it just seemed very",
          "The place is high up the hill in the city of Granada. We took a bus (search Granada buses) across the road from Plaza Nueva (5-10 minutes inexpensive Journey). We were there before the sunset, as heard from many travellers. It was just beautiful and breathtaking view of Alhambra",
          "This is the place where most people go when in Albayzin. It has a slight touristic touch to it I must admit. The view from up here is quite spectacular as you see the Alhambra before you and Granada cityscape beneath. In my opinion the view from the Torre de la Vela in Alhambra",
          "It is high up so if you are visiting from City Centre take one of the mini buses from plaza nueva up and walk down through Albazin. - so Moorish you will beleive you are in Morocco. The views across to the Alhambra palace are truly magnificent- both during the day- when snow on",
          "This is where the Alhambra backed by the Sierra Nevada Mountains photo is taken from. Nice bars .. worth the walk up or get the bus..",
          "Well worth the hike! (Not sure why you'd take a public trans option, unless you were disabled.) I visited near sunset and YES...there were lotsa tourists, quite a few vendors, and some gypsy musicians. As per another review, don't expect to get a clear photo without anyone in",
          "This is the really best spot to take a global picture of the Alhambra with the snowy mountain in the back.",
          "The views of the Alhambra with the snow peaks of the mountains from this lookout point are fantastic. It\u2019s about a 20 minute walk however it is mostly uphill. But you can catch a bus that will take you there very cheaply. There are several cafes that have outdoor terraces with",
          "Fabulous place lots going on , amazing views of the Alhambra. Walked up from the centre passing many lovely little shops selling almost everything!!! Flamenco guitarists, henna tattoos and many crafts stalls are on the square together with the unmistakable smell of herb!!!!!!!!",
          "If you go to Granada and don\u2019t see this sight, you have missed out on a piece of Granada\u2019s crown jewl. It does get very crowded at times, but it is well worth it!",
          "The view of the Alhambra from this view point is unbelievable, like a painting! However, this may be the most touristy place in the whole Granada. My recommendation is to go here to take some nice pictures during the day, but for sunset there are other nice viewpoints that are",
          "This place has one of the best views of the Alambra, the sunset should not be missed here. Its also got some lovely cave houses. People are usually playing some lovely live music at this mirador.",
          "We visited the Mirador de San Nicolas as part of a Segway tour of Granada. The view is fabulous. Come here to take your photographs of The Alhambra, with the beautiful, snow covered peaks of The Sierra Nevada as a stunning backdrop. Be prepared for a crowd, it is worth the wait",
          "The view over the Alhambra and Sierra Nevada is amazing! But be aware of how crowded it can be here! There were even lots of street artists and people who were selling their stuff. But the view is worth it.",
          "We got the cab there from our hotel in the town centre and it cost around 8-9euros. It was worth it as was uphill and very cobbly! I wore the wrong type of shoes so struggled to walk around. We visited the mosque, the square at the top and the museum and had lunch there. A",
          "i\u2019d say in the top 5 globally as breathtaking view of natural and man made beauty. a must when in granada, both daytime and nighttime",
          "Best view of the Alhambra from here , everyone sits on the wall and takes selfies or gets someone to take photos for them. The local gypsies and students gather here to play guitar, sing and sell their jewellery and paintings. Best time to visit is in winter when the snow is on",
          "An eye-popping view of the Alhambra from a hilltop next to the mosque in The Albaicin. Full of young people just hanging out with their dogs, sleeping puppies, etc. Lots of long hair, dreds, man-buns, etc. Very laid-back. Lunch there or at the fun local square a block west.",
          "Really a memorable view from this location. Go here at least once on any trip to Granada. You will see people of every background and walk of life here, all taking in the scenery.",
          "It has many many people , try and get early to view the Alhambra and the snow mountains behind , the views are great , the crowds are not .",
          "An uphill walk through an ancient hill top neighborhood provided a beautiful view of the Alhambra in front of the Sierra Nevada mountains. A few street performers and vendors added to the festive atmosphere. I wish people would leave their selfie sticks home and just enjoy the",
          "Went several times as I was staying close by. The view is really something special and thanks to a bunch of locals, this place is not just packed with annoying tourists, but it has a \"soul\". Locals are selling jewelry, playing music and interacting with tourists. But if you want",
          "We traveled to Granada in January and were blown away by the beauty of the city , there is so much to see and do and so many lookout areas that this one pales a bit , maybe it has recieved too much hype. Still worth the visit as it is on the way to many other great areas to",
          "Some say there are better viewpoints, but this is THE place to be for Sierra Nevada mountain views, Granada sunsets and illumination of the Alhambra all in one place. Just ask the crowd of people you'll have to fight through to get a prime spot at dusk. Being here reminded me",
          "Situated in Albaicin , the oldest area of Granada, this small square gives the most stunning view across to the Alhambra palace complex.",
          "The walk up to the mirador is simply like going back in time, the Albaycin neighborhood is just amazing, full of cobbled streets and little arab shops...once you get to the place the view is simply breathtaking, being able to contemplate the palace, and if you are going in",
          "There are several viewpoints in Granada but we were told that this one is the best. The view didn\u2019t disappoint us, for view of Alhambra or sunset it\u2019s indeed a good choice. The only down side is it\u2019s famous among tourists so expect a big crowd especially before the sunset.",
          "This is the spot a majority of people visit to view the Alhambra (although I personally think there is a better view from Sacromonte). When we visited there was a local three-man band playing guitar and singing traditional songs and it was a fantastic soundtrack for the view.",
          "People playing music, gorgeous view all the way through the city to the Sierra Nevada. People were playing guitar and enjoying the sites. Lots of restaurants in the area and though it is a bit of a trek up there it is worth every step. The winding cobbled streets and beautiful",
          "A lively area, its a nice walk from city center to the top of Mirador de san nicolas, its a bit uphill with some great alleys and old houses. Once you get to the top, they have live music and a nice view point. There are also a few cafes with great view of Alhambra, highly",
          "It\u2019s a short but a little steep climb up through the old town. Nothing really spectacular about the place. A few street traders trying to flog jewellery and leather ware at the viewing point and an annoying boom box blasting out a heavy beat.",
          "An absolutely incredible sunset, and great views of the Alhambra too! Very busy at sunset time (for obvious reasons) but not so much that it obstructed the view.",
          "Stunning views of the Alhambra - amazing free spectacular sunset displays with local arts, crafts and musical accompaniment!",
          "Its one of the main attractions of Granada. If your a Photographer then you will defiantly want to visit this location. I arrived early to set up my tripod so I could get the shot I wanted. But don't worry if you arrive late. People are always coming and going. They take",
          "Very nice atmosphere with great andaluz music background. From here, you can really admire the beauty of Granada and one of the best monument in the world: La Alhambra. Great experience",
          "It is a fantastic place in the city where you can see the Arab, the Christian and the Jewish city, all at the same time in a beautiful environment. Sunsets are recommended. If you go to Granada after the Alhambra the most visited place ... that makes many people always there.",
          "We visited just before sunset. Beautiful views. There was some Spanish music being played and some of the public joined in to dance. The view of Alhambra was pretty good and it lights up as it gets dark. There is a better view from the mosque close by. Worth popping in there and",
          "It is indeed a good viewing point over Alhambra and Sierra Nevada at the back. Very busy with crowds. To get there one need to walk up few narrow windy streets.",
          "You have a wonderful scene and great views of the Alhambra from this point, the only thing is very crowded for the sunset. We took a taxi from the city center. It was fast and not expensive. We really enjoyed this magnificent place from the distance. Just amazing, I highly",
          "It's a climb for sure, but through the most charming neighborhood toy can image. Very Old World with a complexity of nationalities. We couldn't get into the Alhambra so we check this out. Fantastic views of the valley below. Or was a national sunny Sunday morning. When we",
          "There are stunning views of the Alhambra from this spot, although the walk is quite steep. But the church of St Nicholas itself is currently closed for renovation (as at Dec 2018).",
          "View was amazing, lovely ice cream shop and mosque nearby which also had beautiful views. Lovely experience.",
          "Loved this place! Great view of the Alhambra and Sierra Nevada. Busy with tourists, but also there were local vendors and musicians. It was lovely.",
          "We didn't visit the place specially since other reviewers mentioned it was crowded. However, our walking tour of Albaicin and Sacromonte included the site. The view of the Alhambra is beautiful and Granada really has some of the most beautiful sunsets I have seen. However, I",
          "This is part of the little town Albaicin. We came via the tour bus from the other side of the mountain which is Alhambra. Breathtaking view of the old town including the Alps. There are quite a lot of vendors selling souvenirs. It was during lunchtime, many students and young",
          "Very nice with some musicians that play and make you feel in real Spain! I love Granada, people are nice and the place is also clean",
          "Just after getting off the plane we were having lunch around the corner so decided to stroll over. It was absolutely packed with tourists and we looked at the view and could tell why. There were also people selling tourist tat. However later in our trip we went to sacromonte and",
          "The most magnificent views of the Alhambra palace are to be seen from the Mirador de San Nicolas. The sight of the Alhambra, placed on a hill, rising out from Granada and with a backdrop of the snowcapped Sierra Nevada is one not to be missed or forgotten. There are a number of",
          "As all the other reviews state, the view is amazing. However, the venue is obviously cashing in on it as the prices are exuberant when regarding quantity and quality of the food. We were a party of 12 and paid over \u20ac450 for a couple of tapas, three salads to share and a main",
          "Is a beautiful place where you can look at the Alambra, if you prefer you should go at the sunset and the view is amazing!",
          "Great place to view the Alhambra and the mountains behind it. The first place I went to when I returned to Granada.",
          "Stopped off here on my way to another higher viewpoint, but this is a very popular spot as you get great views across to the Alhambra. It is very busy especially at dusk as everyone is up there trying to get pictures and selfies and its not to far from the centre of Granada.",
          "Yes there is a nice view of the Alhambra. But there are also certainly throngs of tourists and we observed several people openly doing drugs and acting in ways that you don\u2019t want children to visit. If you must see it, go and snap a quick pic or too, but don\u2019t expect it to be an",
          "Mirador del San Nicholas is the spot where you can see the view. Evening is a great choice. You don't want to drive your car there. Just horrific to navigate. Simply, take a taxi which costs you a lot less than 10 euros.",
          "Beautiful place to enjoy the gorgeous sunset views! The view of the alambhara set against the snow capped mountains on one side and the setting sun against the mountains in the distance created an unforgettable view! The music by local musicians, artists, some locals selling",
          "When in Granada a visit to the plaza is a must. It provides a good view of Alhambra and is especially nice at sunset. You can walk there from the main square but it is a bit of an uphill walk. For those who don\u2019t want to walk you can take the hop on hop off for 8 euros.",
          "One of the most amazing point of view for the Alhambra castle with the Sierra Nevada on background. It looks like all people all over the World are seatting here to admire this peaceful view.",
          "It is nice to walk in the little streets going up to the Mirador de San Nicolas. The view of the Alhambra is just astonished.",
          "Walk through the small alleys all the way to the top to have a good view of the sunset. It also provide a good overall look of Alhambra from a distance. Go early if you want to have some space at the front as there are lots of people there. A place not to be missed!",
          "Beautiful view and nice to stay and watch the sunset. Usually plenty of vendors and players in the small place.",
          "Sundown is the perfect moment but be ready to find lot of people with your same thoughts. Good idea to go in advance and take a good location.",
          "This is my favourite place in all of Granada. The ambience and crowd usually invlove a busker or musician adding to the feel. The views of the alhambra and sierra are unbeatable. The morroccan restaurant in the corner is fantastic!",
          "Stayed in Albaicin for a night and walked up to this Mirador at sunset. Didn't tour the church as it was getting late but if you go in the afternoon there are some lovely little bars around the Plaza for a pit stop or lunch and time to see the place properly.",
          "After we checked in at our B&B in Albayzin, the frontdesk person reccomended to check out the Mirador. We made our way up through the narrow streets on a rainy evening and there was a guitarist playing Spanish music on the guitar. Nice and peaceful place (but I don't know if it",
          "Great place to view the Alhambra and part of the city. Not that steep to get to. A nice viewing platform with telescopes. Was quite busy with people selling goods and some buskers. We unfortunately didn't get the bright blue skies we were hoping for! Perhaps you will be luckier!",
          "This is the best view of the Alhambra and surrounds, it is definitely worth visiting to take the best pictures in the city.",
          "It takes quite some steps of Carrera del Darro, but totally worth the effort. Whilst arriving there you might feel thirsty....have a drink at El Huerto de Juan Ranas. Not cheap but amazing views.",
          "this is the place to take gorgeous picture of the Alhambra. Try to visit in the evening, that way you can get a beautiful sunset in the background.",
          "A trip to Granada is incomplete, without visiting Mirador San Nicolas. Walking up here itself is a treat, as you observe the transformation in architecture of the buildings.",
          "When I call Mirador de San Niicolas \"the Hill of Magic\", I don't refer to the poor, unfortunate juggler, who kept falling off his rope, while trying to display his \"skills\"!. You think you have arrived in Heaven on Mirador de San Nicolas. Opposite, the magnificent Alhambra can",
          "The view is spectacular but people always sit round the edge so it\u2019s difficult to get the perfect photo.",
          "This square was busy with musicians and other just enjoying the space. The classic view across the city to the Alhambra, with the Sierra Nevada behind, did not disappoint. Consider getting the bus (No.31) up from the city centre as the little lanes are steep.",
          "This is a great viewpoint of the Alhambra. Even on a rainy day in November there was a guy beautifully playing classical guitar on the plaza. There is a minibus stop right below the plaza if you don't want to walk here from your hotel. This is a must see when in Granada plus",
          "I've visited this place at various times (10am - 10:30pm). It's always full of people, of life, of music, of dancing. And a great view of the Alhambra to be had, too!",
          "Never tire of being here Either night or day the view is indescribable You witness one of the finest palaces in the world At night the area is busy with some alternative types but it\u2019s still very safe",
          "The best view of the Alhambra, and perhaps one of the best views in the country! Stroll around while taking pics and enjoy the live Flamenco music in the area. Excellent spot for photographers & tourists!",
          "We we here at sunset on Sunday 11/11/18 looking at the beautiful Alhambra and snow covered mountains in the back ground. Our thoughts on the 100 years commemorations. Very poignant.",
          "The view to the impressive and beautiful Alhambra is just breathtaking! Even more with the different colors of the trees during autumn! Also the way up the the viewing point is beautiful with all its small streets and shops",
          "Visited day and night. Loved the views over the city and the Alhambra. The buskers, singing and playing guitar added to the atmosphere. Bar/restaurant (Juan Ranas) with lovely terrace garden just below is worth a visit.",
          "Walk up through the Albaicin. By the time you reach the Mirador de San Nicolas you\u2019ll need a break. It\u2019s a great spot to sit in the sun. There are some vendors but they\u2019re not obnoxious. Relax and enjoy it.",
          "You can walk up to the overlook or use some form of public transportation. Either way, it\u2019s well worth your time. You can see the Alhambra on the other side of the river, enjoy street performers in the plaza, and enjoy a meal or a cold beverage at a restaurant with stunning",
          "You want the best view to watch the sunset over La Alhambra and the Sierra Nevada mountains, then you need to visit here...",
          "Great zone to be able to see the Alhambra Palace, listen to the music which has always been played by local musicians whenever we have visited there. Well worth the effort to get there if you are walking or the local bus will take you there.",
          "We walked here one morning.very tiring but so worth the effort.the views are a,sizing,looking over to Alhambra .lots of artists about and music.people selling their crafts.lovely atmosphere.well worth the walk.",
          "A walk (or bus journey) to the top of the Albaicin area is rewarded with some fine views of the Alhambra. When we visited the Sierra Nevada mountains behind the Alhambra were snow-capped which added to its magic. As any such site, it can be busy. There are also buskers, people",
          "This is not a well kept secret so the plaza is packed out especially at sunset. The view is fantastic, but it is hard to get to the front of the crowd for an unobstructed look. Perfect conditions for pickpockets",
          "Lovely place to see the Alhambra, especially out up at night. Bustling square full of tourists with some artisan stalls. Loved the walk up there thru the narrow streets of the old Arab quarter...",
          "We took bus #32 up to Plaza San Nicolas and then walked the few steps up a staircase to hit the Plaza and see the view. Though the view was stunning, the area is so full of tourists and street vendors (who packed up very quickly when the local police stopped by) that it didn\u2019t",
          "Even on a damp drizzly evening, the climb to here is well worth it. Looking at Alhambra across the valley, as the night comes and the lights come it. It's mesmerising.",
          "Went here at sunset and the views of the Alhambra were incredible. Even more so if you can score a table overlooking the palace for dinner, which we did!",
          "Climbing all the way up was definitely worth it: the view of the Alhambra is stunning! Came here around 12pm and it wasn\u2019t crowded (it\u2019s autumn and rain season).",
          "Don't expect this to the the end-all of your visit. It gets a bit crowded to watch the sunset. The Alhambra at the sunset is just OK. Bring your own beer or wine and relax.",
          "Been here many times over the past 20 years, and this time stayed just above the Mirador de San Nicolas. The view is worth the walk. Over the years, it has become more crowded with street vendors, but in the evenings and nights there is decent flamenco: guitar, dancing, and",
          "We tried for 5 weeks before our visit to get tickets to the Alhambra without success so to be able to experience this view was the next best thing. We walked up to it which we found fine but most people seemed to get buses or a taxi! I would say even if You get tickets, still",
          "My friends and I got a local bus up here on afternoon.The views of the city are stunning as is the view of the Alhambra.There are people busking and selling bits and bobs but it all adds to the character of the place.Worth a visit",
          "Come a little earlier in the evening, just past sunset, and you'll have the place to yourself. At some point, street hawkers will arrive and set up their wares, followed soon after by the tour bus groups looking for the best night views of the city. Stay later, or come out",
          "Great spot to catch a stunning view of The Alhambra, if you can get a spot with good views. It was very crowded when we went, and we had to wait a while to get a good spot to enjoy the view and take some photos. We had more fun enjoying the view from one of the many nearby",
          "Watching the traders pack their bags as the Police car came into view was interesting. And for a couple of minutes it was quiet - but then they all came back.. The views are amazing, but can be seen elsewhere in the Albaicin.",
          "We walk up here on a hot sunny day to take in the atmosphere and to take some great photos. The Albaicin area is quite bohemian and fun to visit with some places to have a drink and gaze at the Alhambra.",
          "The best view of the Alhambra (without actually being in the Alhambra!) particularly at night. It is a bit of a climb up but worth it, there are a couple of bars and restaurants to rest in. It is popular with tourists so can be busy and there are street musicians and sometimes",
          "As all the tour guides suggest, San Nicolas square is indeed the site to get a magnificent view of the Alhambra. Crowded with hippie type vendors of unnecessary stuff, but the views are great!",
          "We went there at night time and the view of Alhambra from here is mesmerizing. Strongly recommended to visit this spot at sunrise, sunset and night time for amazing view of Alhambra.",
          "Tons of people jostling for position, lots of street people and street artists selling cheap trinkets. The view of the Alhambra is worth it but there are some other more pleasant restaurants and such for that.",
          "Heard a lot about this place and the views to the Alhambra. Agree the views are good especially at dusk when we visited. However we found it be be overcrowded and a bit wild with a street bazaar feel. Not ideal with younger children- loads of people smoking at close quarters.",
          "This is a lively plaza, with some souvenir vendors and street musicians (pretty good Santana wanna be when we were there). The view of the city and of the Alhambra is great. A better view of the Alhambra than you would get from Mirador San Cristobal - that view is of the City,",
          "Just a wonderful place to watch the day end. Lots of different nationalities enjoying a beautiful and historic view of the Alhambra and Granada plain.",
          "The view on the Alhambra is great go in the late afternoon or at sunset. Otherwise you are looking straight into the sun! Lots of street-sell and some gypsy musicians.",
          "We saw this by taking the red bus at the Alhambra for \u20ac1.40 and got a receipt/transfer. We hopped off when the driver stopped at the mirador. The view was fantastic and the Albaic\u00edn neighborhood was incredible. The busses run every 10-15 minutes, so we hoped back on the next one",
          "We went to watch the sun set over the Alhambra so we got to see the transition of lighting from day to night. Great and totally free.",
          "Popular and crowded lookout to the Alhambra, probably because the bus stop is right below it. Better to get there early or late, but either way you will have to claim your position for the best pic. If you're in the neighborhood, it's worth checking out.",
          "This place is the center for all the hippies of Europe! So it seems, anyway you will see a lot of young - and not so young anymore- people dressed and hair like 30 years ago!! They are centered around this place and very often there are outdoor concerts taking place at the",
          "It\u2019s quite a hike uphill through Albayzin but very much worth it. The view of the Alhambra is amazing, and at the top there are a number of cafes and restaurants, a few souvenir shops and also a mosque. The are is very crowded and popular with tourists, especially in the",
          "This is definitely THE place for views of the Alhambra, especially at dusk. There were lots of people there, and you'l have to do a bit of jostling to get to the front for your photo. There are a few bars and restaurants nearby if you want to stay longer. The tourist train stops",
          "The views across to the Alhambra are superb. It was very busy, a lot of people hang out here, and there is a buzz here from the various buskers trying to make a dollar. plus you have the restaurants and lanes of the Albaizin around you-well worth a visit.",
          "We walked, an easy climb of 20 minutes if you are in a reasonably fit. It was interesting to walk on those narrow roads sandwiched between ancient houses kept in good condition. The view was spectacular. Only problem was the place was teeming with tourists (it was Spain",
          "Basically a 10-15 minute steep winding climb up from the Plaza Nueva which avoided the need for further exercise that day! Basically a viewing platform that looks across the valley at the Alhambra. View is amazing and well worth the effort. The church there was wrapped in",
          "The views over la Alhambra from this mirador are awsome. However, the \"chipie-hippie\" people around selling \"chippie-hippie\" bracelets with \"hippie-chippie\" melodies totally dimms off the magic of this historical place. A much nicer option for good views over La Alhambra is El",
          "After a lovely uphill walk through quaint cobbled streets, I made it to the lookout point and was not disappointed by the spectacular view over the city and, more importantly, the amazing view of the Alhambra. This was really a must.",
          "This viewpoint gets very crowded, but gets you an amazing view of the Alhambra in all its glory. Great point for panorama photos.",
          "The beauty of this viewpoint is undeniable, with the Alhambra and the Generalife face to face, the city at its feet, and the magnificent Sierra Nevada behind.",
          "Not only were there great views, but local vendors, artists and musicians made for an enjoyable evening.",
          "The ones who go up there will have lovely view over the city, nice to watch sunsets or sunrises from up there",
          "Nice view in Granada and alhambra. In the evening full of people looking sunset. Look for pickpokets.",
          "We undertook a walking tour of the old town and Abaycin leading up to the Mirador San Nicolas. While a rather steep climb the walk through the quarter revealed small patios, small vendors and traders in traditional goods, arriving at a wonderful view of the Alhambra.",
          "From here you have a magnificent view of the Alhambra and a pleasant place to have coffee or a meal.",
          "Worth visiting to see the Alhambra at sunset. We had an apartment next door so it was easy for us but the tourists loved it. The gypsies came on Sunday to sell their crafts and sing. Wonderful!",
          "walk there and the view will be worthwhile, but be aware that a few hundreds will be there, including many youngsters that spend much time there with drinks and smokes. some good restaurants around to replenish fuel. Good plan",
          "If you're staying anywhere neaf the Cathedral itnis really easy to get here, although a bit of a steep walk up. (Apparently the tourist train goes up bit I didn't use it). The walk up is a great way to see the Albaicin area. It took me about 25 minutes at a steady but not speedy",
          "Don't miss this for a view of the Alhambra. During the day it is spectacular but it comes alive at night with music and dancing. If you thought the Alhambra was beautiful by day its even better at night. Drop down a street or two for some awesome food. I would recommend you",
          "This is a open-air plaza that offers an excellent view of the Alhambra. It is usually crowded with tourists but is large enough to accommodate everyone comfortably. There are artisans selling jewelry and we were treated to two Spanish Guitar buskers. Half a block away is the",
          "Steep walks up to all the Miradores on the Albaicin but wll worth the effort to see the Alhambra peeping through gaps between buildings on the way up. Rather busy at this particular Mirador but nearby restaurants provided a break",
          "Waliking through Granada this point should not be missed. The way up to the hill through the arabic shops is worth for its own, but the view on the Alhambra is unique. Should perhaps be visited in morning or evening since otherwise the sun over the Alhambra spoils the quality of",
          "If in Granada you must do this. Some uneven walking up steep hills though so fitness is important. It is a very old part of Granada and some of the area is hundreds of years old.You could easily spend half a day around there and you have a great view of the Alhambra the other",
          "Without a doubt the best views of The Alhambra in Granada. It is quite a steep walk up through the narrow streets and alley ways to get there but the photo ops are amazing and you can take the little municipal bus for \u20ac1.40. Often there are merchants and performers in the square",
          "We took a taxi from the hotel well worth the 5 euros as very steep. The views are beautiful and once in lifetime .",
          "Well with the walk up to this vantage point. The views are spectacular. You can pin point the cathedral in the centre of the town as well as view the Alhambra on the hills opposite.",
          "Long climb up the hill from the city but worth it to see the view with the Alhambra palace. Stopped for lunch in a near by cafe followed by ice cream at the little ice cream shop just below the square. Entertainment in the small square as well.",
          "This is the second time i am visiting this place at sunset and really enjoy it. Make sure to arrive slightly before sunset and stay till it get dark in order to see the beautiful colors on the sunset light on the Alhambra walls and than the yellow lighting after dark.",
          "Do not try this is you don\u2019t like steps!!! Yes, it\u2019s a long way up with lots of uneven steps to deal with but wow! What a vision when you reach the location! It\u2019s busy, as to be expected, especially around sunset but it\u2019s a great experience. Wonderful way to get into the Granada",
          "It's a steep walk up and down but the view is breathtaking once you get up there. Lots of local vendors selling jewellery and artisan items. You could sit for hours but I would guess sunrise or sunset would be spectacular.",
          "Steep winding narrow streets and stairs lead you there. With the view, especially before sunset, most beautiful panoramic view of Alhambra you are rewarded. Difficult to occupy a good spotting point because it\u2019s always packed with tourist in late afternoon. After taking pictures",
          "But very crowded so it is best to go to one of the restaurants just a few steps away to soak up the views in a much quieter environment",

          "After a climb through the historic district of Albaic\u00edn you reach a flat square, from which you can take photos of the Alhambra and of the mountains surrounding the city. There's also a mosque, don't forget to see it while you're there.",
          "Visited twice, late morning and again evening/sunset. The view is great - obviously - but it was crowded (esp. at sunset) so you have to wait for a gap to get in for a decent photo. Also felt a bit tacky with all the sellers especially when the police turned up and some of them",
          "This place is worth the selfie you\u2019ll post on social media. However don\u2019t plan on just being here. Take the bus up to the viewpoint about an hour before sunset. After sunset walk down the narrow winding streets of the Albaizin back into town. Its a beautiful downhill walk not to",

          "If your up on the higher side of town above the Arabic district this lookout is worth checking out. Views of the Alhambra are best during the late afternoon and closer to sundown. Then it\u2019s all down hill towards the city center",
          "Surely the best views of the Alhambra of all Granada. Recommended to visit at night or at sunset. I recommend visiting the restored Juan Ranas Garden where you can enjoy the best gastronomic flavors of Granada.",
          "This is one of the places to get the best view of the Alhambra. You can reach it on foot but if the weather is hot I recommend a bus or taxi as it\u2019s quite a steep climb up and then walk down through all the beautiful streets, although it can be a maze. I have only visited in",
          "It\u2019s a good walk up the the Mirador, but worth the effort as the views of the Alhambra are fantastic. Good eating places to sit and take in the view with a couple fo cold beers.",
          "Although not as spectacular as the view from higher Miradors, at least this one is fairly easily reached on foot, or indeed accessible by bus with just a short walk up to the viewing patio. Seemed quite lively at various times of day.",
          "This a great stop on your visit to el Barrio Albaicin. There are many restaurants near this viewpoint, and the views of La Alhambra and the rest of Granada are fantastic. I recommend strolling along the residential streets if you are in need for a more relaxing walk away from",
          "Excellent views of the Alhambra and lovely atmosphere in this popular terrace. You can visit a chapel and go up the tower for the perfect view. You may find live bands performing making your visit a little bit more special. After you visit make sure you get lost on your way",

          "Took the hop on hop off tour bus to a nearby stop and made our way to the viewpoint. Incredible views of the alhambra and alcazar, its just a shame it was a little overcast when we went. If we had more time it would have been great to go at sunrise or sunset. There's a little",

          "The best spot to see Granada City and Alhambra for free. Located in Hill of Albaicin area. About 300m away from the city center. The best time to get there is before the sunset, to see Alhambra's magical side, while the sky is changing its color. A must thing to do while in",
          "This is a great place to visit as it moves towards sunset. The place was very busy with lots going on. The views over the Alhambra are exceptional as the sun goes down. We found the place very busy so headed down to one of the restaurants just below and had a drink looking over",
          "Our visit the Mirador San Nicol\u00e1s was even more wonderful than we had expected. The weather was perfect. The crowds were minimal and the flamenco musicians playing in the plaza were entertaining. The view of the Alhambra was exquisite. We highly recommend a visit to this spot",
          "This \"big picture\" view of The Alhambra is not to be missed at the Mirador. It gives you a spectacular overview of the magnificence of this majestic and historic layout of Moorish history, followed by the Spanish who then went on to lay claim to this incredible site. A view",
          "Beautiful observation point. Definitely worth the walk:) We went in the evening to watch the sunset over the Alhambra and it was spectacular. Also wait a bit until it gets dark, so you can see the lit Alhambra.",
          "It was certainly worth the walk up from town to this spectacular mirador! A great spot for photos of the Alhambra...",
          "This has a very good view of Alhambra evening and day. The first route we ended up taking to this place was the residential part so it seem very steep. Go through the route with the shops and monastery so it does not seem too far.",
          "Get around Albaizin and make your way through the narrow streets to the Mirador. The best view of Alhambra.",
          "Amazing view of the building. I actually like the place a lot more from the outside than the inside to be honest. Incredible architecture. Never seen anything quite like it. Great spot to take some pictures and soak up the atmosphere. It does get pretty crowded at key moments",
          "It got much more crowded in the past fifteen years so it's not that easy getting a 'first row' spot, but it's absolutely worth the wait. Try the caf\u00e9 in the street below. It's even better and you can enjoy the view while sipping something.",
          "My son had spent a couple of weeks in Granada so he prepared an itinerary for us which included a walk through the old town up to the mirador of San Nicolas. Best to walk up in the evening as the sun can make it very hard work bu this is 'the' view of the Alhambra from which",
          "Nice place with a spectacular view of Granada and the the Alhambra in particular and Granada\u2019s main mosque is right next to it",
          "The view is breathtaking but worth the uphill climb. There\u2019s a mosque ( Mezquita Mayor de Granada) that you can visit at certain hours as well; it\u2019s worth it",
          "The walk up can be a challenge on a hot day but it's worth it in my mind. Ice-cream, smoothies or beer and tapas awaits at the top as does a spectacular view of the old town nestled under the impressive Alhambra.",
          "The walk to the Mirador is worth every step as it delivers the classic view of the Alhambra..... busy often with music it will be even better when the restoration of the Church is complete and it re-opens",
          "Went there by taxi as one of us wasn\u2019t feeling too well in the heat and the climb is really steep. Once at the top, outside the church (which is being restored), the view is phenomenal from the terrace. It\u2019s a great spot for pictures of the Alhambra and panoramic views of",
          "I knew the view would be good but I wasn\u2019t quite prepared for exactly how utterly breathtaking it was. It\u2019s quite a steep climb through the streets of the old town but you suddenly turn the corner and there it is. Definitely worth the effort.",
          "It's a hike up there, or you can cheat and take a Taxi. We cheated on the way up. The walk down is easier. Great pannoramic views of Alhambra and at dusk it is illuminated.You cannot see the sunset from here but Plaza San Cristobal is near by and faces west.",
          "Good view over the city and to Alhumbra, not far from cafes etc too so if you want to stay for lunch it is an easy option",
          "Nice place to watch the sunset with a view of the Alhambra. There isn\u2019t much in the plaza so you need to time it well for the sunset unless you like sitting on a wall.",
          "Fabulous place to watch the sunset over Alhambra and next to the Mezquita de Mayor (Grand Mosque of Granada). Fabulous atmosphere, with buskers singing in Spanish and playing guitar. Fabulous views of the whitewashed houses of Albaicin and Alhambra.",
          "We got the number 32 bus up here from Alhambra Palace and walked back down the hill after sunset. The views are awesome looking out to the Palace, Granada and the Sierra Nevada. Buskers are playing which affords a wonderful atmosphere and it gets quite crowded. Love it here!",
          "In the height of summer, the walk up here is a challenge but definitely worth it (my partner and I are 48 and 40 and reasonably fit). The view of the Alhambra is stunning, but there are better in Sacromonte. San Nicolas is tourist central, and it\u2019s easy to see why. We walked",
          "Don\u2019t miss this fantastic viewpoint just a few steps off the main road. We found it quite easily after asking a local shop owner. Quite hot in August. Fortunately there are many places to stop for a cold refreshment along the way!",
          "This little square starts filling up a couple of hours before sunset. Musicians come out to entertain you before the real show begins. Stay for the full sunset and snap some amazing pictures. Suggest taking a taxi up here- it's very steep.",
          "Although Mirador of St Nicholas is worth visiting due to the views of Alhambra, it is not the only site you can admire the Alhambra in Albayzin and Sacromonte. Very often it is crowded, so you always can find other similar sites in Albayzin and Sacromonte.",
          "I travelled on the hop on hop off train/bus. I went during the day time and night time. Granada is pretty pretty. You get a great view of the city.",
          "Great views of the Alhambra and mountains beyond. Does get crowded though. The views are supposedly best at night but we did not experience this.",
          "The view of the Alhambra and the city is very nice for a couple of pictures, but that\u2019s about it. Good proximity to the nice moorish quarter of Albaicin allows you to take a nice stroll down towards the city center without too much effort",
          "Toured Alhambra by day and spent the evening having cocktails and tapas watching the sun set on this magnificent building and the Sierra Nevada's behind it.",
          "Great views of the Sierra Nevada. You can see many peaks from here and there are these tufts of vegetation on their slopes.",
          "You can walk up to this viewpoint or grab the tourist mini-bus or tourist hop-on hop-off train. Well worth it. Always some guys playing music up at the viewpoint. Also a well priced snack, ice cream, drink store below the viewpoint.",
          "We took the tourist train to San Nicholas during the day time when it was too hot. You can see Alhamra from there. But since the train ticket is valid for the whole day, we visited the place again in the evening. And what a transformation it was. The colours of the sunset was",
          "We spend a whole afternoon up here till the sun set. Had set of just wondering the streets without any plans so when we realised we weren't far from the veiwing platform we made our way up. Half the fun was getting lost and finding it! We had a few drinks and snacks in a little",
          "Hard to walk there in summer ... but offering a great view of the city and Alhambra. Next to it (to the left) there is a mosque with even a better view.",
          "A great place to stop if you are walking through the Albaicin. There was a fabulous atmosphere with musicians playing and a group of young tourists joining in and dancing. View is incredible too.",
          "I planed to visit Mirador de san Nicolas before our Alhambra visit. It has a great view to the city and to Alhambra as well.",
          "The Mirador viewpoint can be reached by foot, taxi or the hop on/hop off bus by getting off at Stop 5 followed by a short stroll. The view is spectacular so bring your own food and drink for a 2hr sojourn. There are lots of people there throughout the day. Alternatively, eat",
          "The view in the evening around sunset was gorgeous enough, and then they turned on the floodlights and it was even more breathtaking! There is also a little pizza/panini shop on the corner that provided the perfect snack while taking in the view. Definitely worth the 27,000",
          "The views of the Alhambra are just breathtaking. It is as the hill where it is was just place there intentionally. Besides, the atmosphere is always cool and although it is most of the time crowded it is an amazing place and certainly a must do.just below the place there are",
          "It was suggested that after visiting the Alhambra we should walk up to Mirador de San Nicolas which offered great views of the Alhambra. As it was so hot, I decided a taxi was the better option and then walk down into Granada via the narrow streets of Albaicin. Taxi cost 7 Euro",
          "Only one flight of stairs down from the Mirador, get an ice cream (and a beer) from Heladas San Nicolas ... voted one of the top ten ice creams in Spain. Enjoy a spectacular view of Alhambra across the horizon.",
          "We took taxi up from city center for 7 euro. Walk down is easy and fun during the evening. We arrived the square a little early. So we walked around Albayzin . The streets are beautiful! There are a lot of people at square. We stayed there for a while and moved to bar/restaurant",
          "The Mirador de San Nicolas provides a beautiful view of the Alhambra on an adjacent hilltop. Spreading off into the distance is a panoramic view of Granada. As we were enjoying the historic architecture and natural beauty, we (and others at the Mirador) were serenaded by a",
          "Going at sunset was absolutely fabulous! Be prepared for lots of people, but it's totally worth it! If you want to eat at a restaurant up there, I would completely recommend the ones just below the Mirador, but don't dawdle around as they fill up quickly.",
          "Climbed up to this look out on our first day in Granada. Was a little surprised by the hills and steep ascent of some of the roads but was rewarded with a wonderful view of the Alahambra. decent food choices at the top but perhaps better off eating elsewhere, before or after.",
          "This is one of the best places to watch the sun go down on the Alhambra. The square is filled with tourist, with lots of musicians to entertain in the square. Best to catch a taxi there and back as its quite a long up hill walk especially on a hot evening. Taxi will cost 5 euros",
          "This site offers a stunning view of the Alhambra and Granada at sunset. It is definitely worth the time and effort to be there. The musicians also added to the beautiful atmosphere.",
          "Took about 20 minutes to climb up to this viewing point of the Alhambra on the adjoining hill. The climb takes you up through a maze of small cobbled streets and squares. Went early evening, as the guide books recommend, when the sun is setting and got some wonderful photos. A",
          "If you have enough time, don't take a bus there. Streets of Albayzin worth being walked around thoroughly the the Mirador with its view on Alhambra will be a reward for you. Also, it is not difficult to walk up there.",

          "Thiis is where to see the Alhambra at night. The lights came on about 9.30pm after a bumpy bus ride up the very steep hill but we sat and watched the sunset on the palace it was amazing and the photos are fabulous. There was a fight between the street sellers when we where",
          "We ended a tour of Sacromonte here and it was such an amazing view! Worth the walk to see the alhambra from this spot.",
          "Literally opposite to the Alhambra, in this place you can admire all its extension and beauty. I recommend to go during the day and at night to compare the views.",
          "Great view specially after 19:00, when the sun is not sooo hot! Usually are musicians there playing Flamenco. A grwat atmosphere.",
          "It is a very good vista to view the Alhambra and Albazin (the district) in the valley. It is a good hike from Albazin. Cabs also go there.",

          "El Mirador de San Nicolas became famous after Bill Clinton, who studied in Granada, said it was his favourite place. El Mirador offers you an amazing view over the city, but it is very crowded, due to tourists and locals. It is better t go there after 6 pm, when the lights are",
          "Well worth the hike up the narrow winding streets, no right angles. Nice artesania market, jewelry, ceramics.",
          "We stayed in the Albaic\u00edn, just below the Mirador de San Nicol\u00e1s. We walked up for dinner at Kiki and it was really good. There is also a yummy little ice cream shop just down from the plaza. The view of the Alhambra is amazing from up top and lots of people come to hang out and",

          "Lije all the other tourists we went there.. made some nice pictures and bought some nice souvenirs. The view is magic!",
          "It is worth climbing up narrow streest to get to Mirador de San Nicolas. Thera many street singers and guitar players and flamenco dancers that perfom there. Take care about your belongings.",
          "Yes, it\u2019s a sweeping view, but you don\u2019t see a great deal extra here if you\u2019re spending at least 2 days in Granada. Winter-time, with clear skies and serious snow on the mountains will likely be much better than hazy summer.",
          "This is a fun plaza. While we were there they had some very good guitar players and vendors selling jewelry, etc. We took many pictures of the Alhambra as it is beautiful as the light changes and we also ate lunch at Bar Kiki which is just off the small square. Lots of fun",
          "I highly recommend adventurers visit the view of the Alhambra at san nicolaus. And walk up the hill through the meandering passage ways through the market. It is worth it especially at night.",
          "The square outside this (currently-being-renovated) church provides the best place to view the Alhambra at any time of the day, apparently especially at and after sunset (although we were there only during daylight). The square seems to be a magnet for a few souvenir traders and",

          "You have to go on a clear night! The reason is the gypsies sometimes come to play music there. People crowd around to listen and dance, which photographing the Alhambra. It\u2019s a beautiful spot to sight see. A workout for your legs, but worth it. Lol",
          "The photographs are inadequate in describing this mirador. You really need to see it for yourself. While we were there there was typically Spanish music by a group of musicians and a few stalls selling the usual stuff.",
          "As if the view weren't enough, there were some excellent musicians singing and playing guitar. With the Alhambra as a back drop they might have sounded better than they really were, but in any case, it was memorable!",

          "Nice outlook over the city and the old palace.  Rough cobblestones so be careful when you walk around.  We were there in the at the end of the shoulder season and there were lots of people there so expect it to be croweded during the height \u2026",
          "If you want the best view, this is the place to visit.",
          "Absolutey gorgeous views of Granada. You will have to leave your car and walk to this place. Access is only for locals or taxis. However its definitely worth getting here and enjoy the view. There are several restaurants around this place that also have views. Definitely worth it",
          "It's a  long. steep climb but definitely worth the effort. Don't forget to pay a visit to the grand mosque of Granada. It  is located next to  the Mirador. It offers a different but equally amazing view.",

          "Beautiful spot to see the sun go down but very busy",

          "So many tourist... very difficult to find a spot to take photo.  Better to pay a bit more to find a restaurant nearby for a better photo spot.",
          "A must see place if you visit Granada. You will enjoy a great view of Alhambra specially at sunset. Usually crowded place so be patient and wait to get your photo. Bring a tele objective to get closer details.",
          "A very good place to enjoy the city view of Granada, you could sit there watching sunset with some beers.",
          "Finishing off the work week seems like such an accomplishment after leaving such a beautiful country like Spain. While the weather was a little more chilly than we expected, it still did not disappoint. Even though I didn't put my four \u2026",
          "Come before sunset for a good views a lot of people here and also good to have a preview of Alhambra before your actual visit",
          "This is a super location to get a great view over towards the Alhambra, the snow covered mountains and the rest of Grenada. \n\nThere are wide areas of wall that you can sit on which makes it easy to get a decent photo. It is a very popular \u2026",
          "Lovely mirador. Great view to the surrounding hills and of course La Alhambra. Very Bohemian atmosphere up there. There are always people selling handmade crafts and singing flamenco. Only minus point is the very penetrating marijuana smell all over the place!",
          "Good views of the Alhambra :) But if you want to make it worth, go by feet and don't take the cab lazy person!!",
          "A beautiful place where can see entirety of Granada's beauty ,once you reached the place above the city. You can enjoy typical sounds and smells; just try not to lose your wallet while taking pictures :)",
          "Beautiful views of the AlHambra complex. Easily accessible by foot. Recommended to go before sunset so that you can see the day and night views. Don't forget to be there early as it is usually crowded in the evening.",
          "Good point to see Granada and Alhambra from afar but very crowded and noisy. Preferred the tranquility from higher up although the view wasn\u2019t quite as good. Steep walk uphill from the main city centre.",
          "Beautiful views in the square of Albaycin with flamenco musicians. Very busy at sun set. Lots of bars and restaurants around the square(little pricier) . Most romantic spot in Granada (maybe all of Andalusia?)",
          "The view from San Nicolas is astounding with the snow capped mountains of Sierra Nevada in the background. It\u2019s a bit of a trek up from the valley but there is a fast straight way down through narrow cobbled centuries old lanes - not for \u2026",
          "Great view on Alhambra palace. You can still feel the climate  of this old gypsy district seeing people dancing and playing live Spanish music.",
          "From here you have an awesome view of the Alhambra. Unfortunately on the day we were here it was cloudy but I've been told that it has amazing views during the sunset and from what I saw I can imagine that it would be true. You can also see from here the Sierra Nevada which is crazy beautiful.",
          "Nice view but too crowded and it's only February. I can't imagine how it would be on the summer.",
          "The most beautiful at sunset! With a great view of the Sierra Nevada and the Alhambra",
          "A must see, hiking up is bitter sweet! Lovely views and you can buy beer from the restaurants in the plaza and take them to watch the sunset. Stay away from the Henna tattoo guys!",
          "This is a magical place to look at the Alhambra from the albaycin it's the iconic place to take photos. The albaycin is the Moorish area of Granada and it retains its magic with steep narrow streets. Well worth getting lost in and exploring.",
          "The perfect lookout point to enjoy the beauty of the Alhambra and the Sierra Nevada mountains. It's most enjoyable during the golden hour prior to the sunset. If you want a great spot sitting on the ledge make sure to get there and least 2 hours before sunset as it tends to get very crowded. Definitely a must visit when in Granada.",
          "Too many people for the sunset view. The palace view is great, especially under dusk. The sunset itself is just so so.",
          "A very good place to watch the Alhambra! But if you don't like crowds, go to Casa Museo Max Moreau a hundred meters before, it is worth it!! \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Probably the most visited mirador in Granada. I had a privilege to live just a couple of minutes away from it. It is usually crowded. Most of the time you can find flamenco singers who add up to a unique Andalusian atmosphere. I visited a \u2026",
          "f you are going to Alhambra, do not miss Albayzin. It is part of town situated on slope of hill that has fantastic view to Alhambra palace and Granada. It is a 10 minutes walk trough steep and narow streets until you get to plaza with magnificent view (miraduro) to Alhambra and Granada.",
          "Best time to take picture of Alhambra is sunset. Redish color ... beautiful",
          "It is a long walk up, but when you get there the view is absolutely amazing and it is 100% worth it!",

          "Nice views of the city and of the Alhambra. Very busy when we went, full of tourists, students and people singing for money. If that's the vibe you like, you will enjoy it, just be careful with pickpockets as apparently there are plenty \u2026",
          "Great place to visit, especially in the evening where there are less tourists and more people from the local area.",
          "The best view you can get if you want to see Alhambra, but definitely not the most scenic one in Granada. I don't like tha fact that is always too crowded but if you are persistent you can get a view from the first row. It can be a problem \u2026",
          "This is the classic postcard view of the Alhambra stunning and unmissable. Pleasingly the nearest bars are all reasonably priced despite the setting",
          "Beautiful views of the city and some cute restaurants around. It\u2019s kind of a tough walk up, because it\u2019s uphill, but you can also take the bus so you can walk less. Highly recommend!",
          "Fantastic view from here! Go and take time to relax!",
          "Great view but too many people there",
          "It is a decent uphill walk to get there, but the view of the Alhambra and the mountains are worth it. Especially if you get there to see the sunset, truly beautiful! Don\u2019t recommend going before dark though, I heard many things about pickpocketing happening.",
          "The dark side of the Royal Palace but painted all-white.",
          "Definetly this is the plaza to enjoy an amazing view of la Alhambra. In the very centre of Albaic\u00edn and surrounded by many places to eat out.",

          "Great spot for photography and stunning views of the Alhambra by day and night. Get the local bus as it's a very steep hill up. Bus no 31/33 from Plaza Nuovo",
          "Most magical view point ever!",
          "Beautiful location to watch the Alhambra during sunset. Lots of people there so be sure to get a spot early. Very nice viewing of the whole city.",

          "Best sightseeing ever! Breathtaking view.",

          "Great view of Alhambra, a bit crowdy for taking nice pictures",

          "An amazing point of view right in front of the Alhambra!",
          "Perfect views! Don't miss this! So glad we came here. It's terrific.",
          "Visited at night gives great impression. View breathtaking, especially illuminated Alhambra. Viewpoint situated at the hill, quite and isolated, this part of the city is the most charming and cute. I tooked a picture every 10 steps. Lovely",
          "Go there during the day or night for majestic views of the Alhambra and the city of Granada in general.",
          "This is a great spot for the amazing view of the Alhambra. It\u2019s a small square in front of a church that has an uninterrupted view. It gets quite busy in the evenings as the sun goes down, as everyone wants to get a picture of the sun \u2026",
          "Great view of la Alhambra at sunset. It does get quite busy so find some space early near the edge if you're taking photos. You'll find street musicians and blanket vendors here too. Expect an uphill walk if you're walking from Grenada",
          "Lovely walk to the older part of Granada.  Amazing views.   Very steep climb but you can drive to a carpark almost at the top or get a bus part way.  We walked up by the main road and took a quirky path by some cave dwellers houses back to the town.",

          "Precious. One of the most beautiful places in the world.",

          "Amazing views of the Alhambra, especially at sunset. It has lost some of its charm in recent years due to noisy crowds at practically all hours of the day. But it still ranks as a must-stop in the Albaic\u00edn, the oldest and most charming area of Granada. Good (mostly high-priced) restaurants nearby.",

          "It is a MUST for every tourist to spend the morning OR evening for sunrise/sunset at this place to witness one of the best views in Granada. Really well worth the energy spent walking up the hill and stairs! You get to see the mountains and Alhambra in its glory!",

          "The grand views from this terrace are not exaggerated. Over crowded at sunset, it offers spectacular views of the Alhambra. Take C32 bus to it. It's short walk but quite a climb for the elderly. Best to be there an hour before sunset and \u2026",
          "The view point is truly the best to admire the Alhambra. Most times of the day this is indeed great! My only mention is that it is hyper crowded! We went during the sun set and while amazing it is difficult to see anything! Once the crowd dies down (or you find a spot in the first line) it is worth it though!!",
          "Great view of the Alhambra. There's is an interesting view after sunset too.\n\nIt's a cozy place with some street musicians in the evenings, tourists trying to catch some pictures, local youngsters making small talk over beer etc",

The ambiance is good with locals up there playing music and people selling tourist stuff, but I heard to be careful and also watch for pick pockets. View is amazing and a must if in Granada!",
          "It's a beautiful place, in a beautiful location.  The service was excellent, but the food wasn't really very good, and the prices were medium-high.  Too bad!  The waiter was nice and the waitress was adorable.  Yeah, but not the food...",

          "A beautiful view of Alhambra and Generalife. Definitely worth it.",
          "Very good view of Alhambra, but packed with tourists and sketchy locals.  You can get similar views without the busloads of people in other parts of Sacramonte, but you'll have to walk around.  See the cave museum.",

          "If you want a bird's eye view of the city of Granada this is a place to be.

          "The only thing this place has going for it is the view. Super crowded. Had a bit of a \"watch your pockets\" feel about it. Not very clean. If not for the view- meh. But the view gives it all the stars. However the three stars are for the \u2026",

          "One of the best places of Granada. What a view!",
          "Arguably the best evening view of Alhambra, although the place is too crowded. But the route itself is amazing, no matter where you start. Albayzin streets are beautiful, each on their own.",

          "Must be  must see...Alhambra is great....",

          "This took our breath away. Get there early to take pictures without clouds and for good pictures. Get there during the sunset hour for a lively atmosphere with romantic music. There were a lot of tourists there pretty much all day but we had better luck shortly before 10am",
          "Great views of Alhambra.  You can take the bus if you don't want to walk uphill all the way to get here.  Bus  C32 or C31",

My recommendation is to avoid the time when the sun is high... because it can obfuscate the view...\nIt's usually full of people, some tourists some hippies and some local young people drinking playing and so on..",

          "Great spot to climb to see a view of majestic Alhambra, along with hundreds of other people at sunset. There are also some locals selling their wares and musicians singing to Spanish guitar music.",
          "Very nice spot for enjoying Alhambra. Both night and day, the view is superb. There are usually people selling different hand-made items, and some singing. Head out later in the evening for a less crowded, feeric experience.",
          "Good views on alhambra but too crowded at sunset and night",
          "Fantastic view of Alhambra",
          "Be aware that the square is jam packed with visitors throughout the day. \nIt is very difficult to get a decent picture as it has so packed. No where to sit.\nHundreds of people and all the benches taken up by street vendors selling cheap \u2026",
          "The winding, narrow, cobblestone streets, houses, balconies, & flower gardens of this area were a delight, as well as the spectacular view of the Alhambra from there!",
          "Beautiful location to view the Alhambra.  Can get very busy approaching sunset but still worth the visit for the views and ambience.",
          "Beautiful view point with a remarkable view of the alhambra and generalife. Well worth the walk up the hill. It is quite a steep climb in the heat so take the bus (c1) if not great on your feet. However the widening streets on the way up were a sight in themselves, so I'd recommend the walk.",
          "Beautiful view of Alhambra and Granada. Lots of groups head here and is very close to the Granada tourist train stop 5. Well worth a stop and the walk down is very interesting.",
          "Beautiful view of the Alhambra, like a painting!! But too crowded, I recommend other viewpoints for sunset (e.g. mirador de san miguel, mirador de san cristobal)",
          "Incredible place to listen to flamenco music while looking at the Al Hambra and the vast, often snowy sierra nevada.",
          "Good view but to much people",
          "The best spot to see the entire Alhambra. I recomendable taking a cab or the bus, the walk is steep and you share the road with vehicles with no sidewalk. Plan your visit at Sunset, absolutely incredible.",
          "Amazing view",
          "Nice place with open sky for scenic pictures of La Alhambra and Sierra Nevada. Mosque next to it is worth visiting, small but nice sacred place.",
          "This lookout point offers one of the best views of the Alhambra complex.  A must if you are looking for some great pictures.  There are also some great places to eat and take a drink around the lookout which also provide a great view.  A bit pricey but worth it.",
          "beautiful view at sunset!",
          "A must see if you ever visit Granada or just pass near by. No visit to Granada is complete if you don't get lost on the alleys from Albaicin neighbourhood and end up in San Nicolas mirador. Amazing ambience with one of the best viewed towards Alhambra and the gypsies playing their flamenco in the background.",
          "Not that impressed the view is ok but keep climbing or take a bus to San Miguel for the very best view of Granada",
          "Love it",
          "Great views of Alhambra and Sierra Nevada.",
          "Good views, but not so good ambience",

          "A nice spot to see Alhambra from distance. Easy to get there walking or by bus",
          "Just epic. You get a nice view of Granada as well as Alhambra. The lighting on Alhambra is just awesome after sunset. The best time to visit the place is at the time of sunset. Also, you could climb the hills behind and get a better view. A lot of people would be there at the time of sunset.",
          "The best (free) view of Granada. Dramatic sunset, great views of the Alhambra, perfect peek at the snowy mountains in the background. A must. It takes a good 15 minute walk uphill but it is worth it.",
          "nice place to look for Alhambra",
          "You can see the Alahambra and the Sierra Nevada from here! Totally nice\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Easily reachable and great view of Alhambra",
          "Very nice view from the top",
          "Expensive; poor food and mediocre service. However. SPECTACULAR, BEST views of city. Get a drink and enjoy!",
          "The perfect place for a gorgeous view of Alhambra. Go really early or when the sun sets. Unfortunately you will not be there alone. When you manage to get to the front, you will not be disappointed.",
          "Great views",
          "Don't miss this visit. For just 2 euros, you get the best view possible of the Alhambra. The history of the church is very interesting too. Carlos (guide, manager, janitor, cashier) was very generous of his time to share his passion of Granada and the San Nicola Church. ",
          "100% worth it. Its hard to climb but i don't regret it, the scenery is magnificent, you get to see la alhambra with sierra nevada behind. Magnificent! there's also a square with terraces where you can have a ca\u00f1a with a tapa.",
          "Good food but the view is the selling point.",
          "Go on a rainy Tuesday to avoid the crowds",
          "An amazing spot to view Alhambra but the amount of weed smoking hippies/gypsies in the area is definitely a turn off. The entire Albaicin area just stank of marijuana. Church itself was closed for restoration when we arrived unfortunately.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Palace of Charles V is a Renaissance building in Granada, southern Spain, located on the top of the hill of the Assabica, inside the Nasrid fortification of the Alhambra. The building has never been a home to a monarch and stood roofless until 1957.The structure was commanded by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who wished to establish his residence close to the Alhambra palaces. Although the Catholic Monarchs had already altered some rooms of the Alhambra after the conquest of the city in 1492, Charles V intended to construct a permanent residence befitting an emperor. The project was given to Pedro Machuca, an architect whose biography and influences are poorly understood. At the time, Spanish architecture was immersed in the Plateresque style, still with traces of Gothic origin. Machuca built a palace corresponding stylistically to Mannerism, a mode still in its infancy in Italy. The exterior of the building uses a typically Renaissance combination of rustication on the lower level and ashlar on the upper. Even if accounts that place Machuca in the atelier of Michelangelo are accepted, at the time of the construction of the palace in 1527, the latter had yet to design the majority of his architectural works.\n\nThe plan of the palace is a 17-metre (56 ft) high, 63-metre (207 ft) square containing an inner circular patio. This has no precedent in Renaissance architecture, and places the building in the avant-garde of its time. The palace has two floors (not counting mezzanine floors). The classical orders are in pilaster form except around the central doorways. On the exterior, the lower floor is in the Tuscan order, with the pilasters \"blocked\" by continuing the heavy rustication across them, while the upper storey uses the Ionic order, with elaborately pedimented lower windows below round windows. Both main fa\u00e7ades emphasize the  portals, made of stone from the Sierra Elvira.\n\nThe circular patio has also two levels. The lower consists of a Doric colonnade of conglomerate stone, with an orthodox classical entablature formed of triglyphs and metopes. The upper floor is formed by a stylized Ionic colonnade whose entablature has no decoration. This organisation of the patio shows a deep knowledge of Roman architecture, and would be framed in pure Renaissance style but for its curved shape, which surprises the visitor entering from the main fa\u00e7ades. The interior spaces and the staircases are also governed by the combination of square and circle. Similar aesthetic devices would be developed in the following decades under the classification of Mannerism.\nThe palace was not completed, and remained roofless until the late twentieth century.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoto Essay on the Palace of Charles V",

          "We had some extra time before going into the Nasrid Palace and happened across this building which is included in the Alhambra ticket. It didn\u2019t seem well advertised but I am glad we wandered in as the circular patio was most certainly impressive. Doesn\u2019t take long to walk",

          "Free entry but that is for a very clear reason. There is nothing to see exept for the building itself. A quick peek on the main entrance and a quick glimpse of the round square in the middle and you\u2019re done. 10 min.",
          "the Carlos V Palace was included in our Alhambra Private Tour with granadapicnictours. Wecwerectaken inside the rotunda and it was explained to us that originally itvwascto have a roof. The palace was never lived in byba Monarch and now has 2 museums, and special exhibits.",
          "The inner courtyard is a beautiful example of the Mudejar architecture that includes elements of Islamic design. This is a popular site, so it is crowded during the day. But it's possible to visit at night a couple of days during the week, and definitely worth doing.",
          "The two museums are both interesting, although I would not call them outstanding. You can't take pictures inside the museums, but you may take pictures in the central circular courtyard. Check out the acoustics in this courtyard.",
          "This palace you will pass when you have done the \u201cGeneralive\u201d and you are on your way to the Nasrid Palaces. This is a square building and has a round open space on the inside and this divided on two levels. You can also visit on the second level an exposition of \u201cFine Arts\u201d but",
          "At the Alhambra, it is one of the buildings that is worth visiting and that doesn't take a long time.",
          "There is nothing special about this building save that it demonstrates that Carlos V had no sense of the greatness of his predecessors who ruled Islamic Granada. For contrast as you tour Alhambra it makes an interesting discussion on power and architecture.",
          "Good to visit the palace when already in al hambra. Nice to go not the most amazing but the worth. The best for us was generalife.",
          "Im sure that had the palace of Carlos been located in another place it may have dazzled the eyes. But it's within the Alhambra, the most dazzling architectural gem in Spain, and so is a poor cousin. It seems out of place, an abomination placed to cement ownership of the Alhambra.",
          "Beautiful architecture. It is the only free part to visit of the Alhambra, if you don't count the beautiful walk up the hill and the surrounding area of the alhambra, which is definitely worth the walk as well, from both sides. Beautiful palace. The light in late afternoon is",
          "The main part of this palace seems to be the architecture, which is nice but nothing spectacular. There are two museums located inside - one on Moorish history and one on Fine Arts. We ducked into the fine arts exhibit for a brief moment and found it rather dull, so left.",
          "This palace is a beautiful place to visit not only for the grandiosity of the architecture but there are also a museum and photos exposition inside",
          "The fact that this building was never finished does not detract from the incredible architecture and the ambition of Carlos V in commissioning it.",
          "This attraction is part of the AlHambra admission, although you can get it before or after your assigned time for the Palacio Nazarios.",
          "nice place to burn time while waiting for your Nasrid Palace time slot. good, well maintained pieces from the glory years of the Alhambra",
          "This section of the Alhambra houses the museum's, but in itself has little to offer. The circular courtyard is of note, but little else.",
          "I found this to be as interesting as the Nazrid Palace. Interesting architecturally and a fabulous art museum on the 2nd floor.",
          "You'd never know inside this unimpressive facade is a huge circular courtyard adorned with two levels of Roman columns. What a pleasant surprise! We almost passed it up. If you're already visiting the Alhambra, don't miss it. It's quite impressive inside and quite a contrast",
          "It is a beautiful and amazing place. The architecture is simply beautiful and enthralling. The beautiful structure, the amazing carving. It is an experience to walk in the garden and thereafter to examine the great palace. A must visit if you are in Granada.",
          "Very different from the other palaces in the complex, this is a throwback to Roman Antiquity, very cool to see the contrast. Also includes the Alhambra Museum and Museum of Fine Arts.",
          "When visiting the Alhambra I would highly recommend a visit to the Palace, the ground floor houses the museum of the Alhambra which has some very good artifacts as well as information and then an area about the architecture of the Alhambra. The top floor has two great spaces",
          "As part of the Alhambra experience I would recommend visiting the museums inside this circular architectural palace.",
          "We were advised to reserve 4 hours to visit the Allhambra. We started at the top, with the Generalife and finished up with the old towers and Palacios Nazaries at 4. It all worked perfect, except for the fact that we had some time to visit the museum of the alhambra, located",
          "We didn't find the palace that interesting but there is an art gallery and a museum there (free entry) that took our attention much more!",
          "Good for getting out of Granada's November rain with the added extra of an exhibition of the plans of the last refurbishment of the site.",
          "There is a semicircle of old columns with some kind of roof being added in very recent years. A nice staircase. I don't remember anything else.",
          "It's one of the palaces of the Alhambra Palace. It was built by Carlos V who couldn't achieve it (no roof) because of a lack of resources. Now you can visit it freely and it holds in the ground floor a museum (not free).",
          "We share Washington Irving's belief that this palace detracts from the beauty of Alhambra, not to mention its destruction of whatever preceded it. It is hyped as a landmark of Renaissance architecture, but the real value for tourists are the two museums - the archeological",

          "The Palace of Carlos V is a very beautiful building with its round shape. One enter the building and one can see the empty space in the middle of the building and the corridor on the second floor. The building has two museums, the one on the ground floor being the Alhambra",
          "An interesting Renaissance style palace constructed for Carlos V. It is next to the Alhambra. The palace appears at odds as it is adjacent to the Moorish palaces. The palace is square however on entry, an impressive circular courtyard comes into sight. Nice area to stroll",
          "Interesting building which was never used by King Carlos after it was finished. Big square building with a most interesting center section. A speaker can stand in the middle of a very large round area and without amplification people around the circle's edge can clearly hear",
          "Charles V Palace, built right in front of the Nazaries Palace, to some looks out of place on this site with Moorish styled buildings. Its a European Renaissance palace of Charles V, the grandson of Spain's famous rulers, Ferdinand and Isabella. From the outside, the palace has",

          "I went in, but it's nothing special. I appreciated much more the Fine arts museum that is hosted in its second floor: ticket price 1.5 euros, but many categories are exempted, like students.",
          "It is a ususl part of Alhambra visit in Granada.It is somehow different from other palaces of Alhambra.",
          "Not a lot to see other than the building, but that is pretty amazing. Never used for its purpose, it somehow survived and has been preserved with the added roof and windows. Very interesting design.",
          "Neo classical, a bit dull on the outside: a sweeping circular and balconied courtyard within; a lovely building.",
          "The exterior is lovely and the rotunda is impressive, but the interior leaves a lot to be desired. There's no beautiful furniture, textiles, or art - it's completely bare. There is a worthwhile small museum in one section and also a special exhibit we enjoyed. This is considered",
          "almost empty, but it deserves to be visited in Alhambra. the Reconquista one of the most important facts of the European Continent",
          "Quite frankly, I would recommend one place over another in the Alhambra as it is fantastic as a whole and no one portion stood out more to me than another. Having said that, seeing this palace with a private guide, as the four of us did, enhanced our understanding of the",
          "The Spanish on taking the Alhambra built a palace with a rotunda style design and it is quite impressive. It is not the immediate muse see sight, but does offer a museum and different architectural style to the rest of the complex.",
          "Looks very impressive from the outside but nothing much inside, other parts of the Alhambra much better",
          "Not much to see here. Seems a bit out of place. Have a quick look inside then continue on to other parts of the Alhambra.",
          "There's really not much to see here except from the museums but those have own sections. Palace does not really fit into concept of \"moslim Alhambra\" and compared to all other palaces it's boring. Anyway attending some classic music concert must be magical under the open sky",
          "This imposing building was designed to impress, built of stones too large for any man to carry. It is a very dominant building, adjacent to the Church of Santa Maria, which in contrast is built of humble brick and stone. The Palace of Charles V is a wonderful square palace",
          "I was misled to believe there was much to see. There is not. It takes 30 seconds to look around and take a picture.",
          "The inside of this palace is a circular plaza with pillars. You wouldn't know from the outside, but you should check it out!",
          "This is not so much a palace, but a sort of \"circular\" site. There is probably more to it than that but that is all the visitor is allowed to enjoy. A site full of columns and doorways and staircases. It's nice to look at for a few minutes but not really much more.",
          "This palace might have been a masterpiece of Renaissance in a different place, but in Alhambra it is just something you visit if you have time to kill.",
          "It was a shock to enter this magnificent and huge square building to find the centre is a gigantic circle, like the Colosseum! We toured the Fine Art galleries which are wonderful and loved seeing the palace which is such a surprise in the middle of the Moorish Alhambra.",
          "Charles the Fifth had this built for himself within the Alhambra. Because it took 50 years to build, he never lived here. A very impressive building. One of Spain's great Renaisence buildings.",
          "Reviewed this separately under Alhambra Museum. Free admission. Contains 2 museums, one is artifacts from the earlier era and the other- historical art. No ticket needed. Located with grounds of the Alhambra.",
          "It is not the most impressive place at the Alhambra, but once you are there you must visit. It was built by Carlos V in the place of some moorish construction. The palace now hosts two museums.",
          "This is a large building with the most wonderful and stunning artistic design and is well worth a visit.",
          "The whole of the Alhambra is one of the great man made places on the planet and the spender of the palace only adds to this. Having viewed 9th century Moor's grandeur the palace shows changes in design after their decline. A must place to visit.",
          "If you are in The Alhambra and have a few extra minutes (rather than wait in line for the palaces) go inside to see the impressive colonnaded courtyard.",
          "After visiting the Alhambra, this leaves much to be desired. It is thin and not all that engaging. But the Alhambra, well worth the visit and the cost!",
          "Frankly disappointed from this one. The exterior is fab, but once in you will find a palace that was not \"completed\" at the time because of no funds. Hence from an historic perspective this place passed through several ages and has no well defined character. At the time of my",
          "Good views inside, the access to the building is free and you dont need a ticket, so you can visit before the Alhambra. Very photogenic place.",
          "I think if this was on the top of a hill somewhere, or commanding a vast piazza somewhere it would be pretty awesome. However positioned in the middle of the Alhambra it seems totally out of place and awkward. The most impressive element is the huge circular area with 2 tiers",

          "The whole complex is utterly amazing and the palace of Carlos V is a part of the whole vast complex. Beautiful architecture but there is not really much to see in the once-grand palace. It seems out of place. There is quite an interesting history behind the palace.",
          "Give a short time to the palace once inside the Alhambra. The architecture part is seen in a few moments. Take some time for the museum in the basement. A beautiful building but the Renaissance style has nothing to do with the Moorish style elsewhere.",
          "We had read we get to see royal apartment here too but we saw only the museum. The exhibits were pretty good though",
          "Limited information about the palace. Not very much inside and the art exhibition is an acquired taste.",

          "Beautiful palaces in Alhambra. Important note is to book the tickets at least 3 months in advance. Take your time inside the castles as they are huge!",
          "Very good place to visit. When you buy an entry ticket to Nasrides palace you have to wait your entry time they won't let you enter before they keep a fix number of visitors. You can be there 5 min in the queue before. If you see people waiting after the hour it's just not their time.",

          "This is an interesting museum with exhibits of torture from the Inquisition. However, the main attraction for us was the Flamenco show in the small theatre which was magnificent.",
          "Simply put, this is a museum that glorifies genocide. For me, someone who identifies as Jewish, traveling through southern Spain bares constant reminders of a culture that was completely erased. It's somewhat akin to traveling to Germany or Poland, which hold the brutal scars",
          "I've been to other \"torture\" museums with a more extensive collection of antique instruments -- this exhibit does a solid job checking the boxes with a sampling of items -- but what I really liked was the well-researched, clear series of posters describing the history the led",
          "No nonsense, totally non-touristy, pure, neat, brilliant flamenco performance: one wonderful singer, one magical, virtuous guitarist, two marvelous dancers - a man and a woman - and a powerfully moving performance. Don\u2019t miss it!",
          "Unlike another review can't say I've done lots of museums of torture or the inquisition but found the exhibit interesting. First floor is flameco, top floor photography. Live flamenco wasn't performed on a sunday.",
          "I found this to be an odd blend with the flamenco on the ground floor, the instruments of torture on the first and then photography on the second - all very important and relevant to the history of the area but I just didn\u2019t feel it went together that well. The flamenco part",
          "7 euros per person was a crime - not worth it. I have been to many museums of torture and inquisition which were much better",

          "I\u2019ve always been fascinated in visiting this type of museums and this one in Granada did not disappoint. Although it was smaller from others I have seen, it had a good set of torture tools used in the Inquisition. It frightful to realize the type of torture tools that were",
          "I agree wholeheartedly with others who say that the exhibit is arranged poorly and without any explanation accompanying the instruments of torture used, by whom, and in what countries/centuries. Because it doubles as a performance space, I understand the need for the Flamenco",
          "All over the web, the Palacio de los Olividados advertises as having memorabilia from the time of the expulsion of the Jews from Granada in 1492. They have nothing at all! I was disappointed.",
          "Interesting information on the origin of flamenco music. The first floor has many if the gruesome torture apparatus from the inquisition. All a bit stomach turning and shocking. The top floor has lovely photos of the area and there\u2019s a great view of Alhambra from the top and",
          "Whilst I found this horrific, it felt very educational and insightful. I would highly recommend this if you have time to spare on a visit to Granada. However I'd suggest it's only for English or Spanish speakers since all the exhibits had signage in those two languages, and you",
          "This museum dedicated to forgotten ones (Jews driven from Granada as a result of the Inquisition) is small, but powerful. It reviews the sordid history associated with the expulsion of Sephardic Jews from Granada (in particular) and from Spain (in general). When I visited",
          "I have always told people that my award for worst tourist trap ever is the London Dungeon. This place is smaller and less expensive, but I found offense at every turn. First, the instruments of torture and their descriptions seemed focused on prurient interests. The",

          "I'd always been familiar with the inquisition, but to see it up close and learn even more history was amazing. At times it was quite hard to read the descriptions of some of the torture devices. It's amazing that humans are capable of such horrific things. To see a desk that at",

The exhibit was sobering at Santa Ines (b. 16th c), the home",

          "This is an excellent little museum of several floors. A humbling look into the inhumanity of certain parts of our history. Definitely worth a visit. Not recommended for the young.",
          "This was a small museum about the Inquisition and Jewish life in Spain. It was really quite interesting. I enjoyed the part of the museum about Jewish life in Spain more than the stuff about the Inquisition itself, simply because of the horrific subject matter in the Inquisition",
          "I found the sight of all these instruments of torture quite awful. How could a people who built such beautiful Cathedrals and Churches be also so barbaric to each other? But I suppose it still goes in parts of the world today. Everything is well written in English as well as",
          "The Spanish inquisition was a dark page in history, and should be remembered for its atrocities. I think this museum gives a good image of why the inquisition was performed. The Jews and Muslims that were forcefully converted were not trusted to be proper Christians, as it was",

According to my guidebook, it\u2019s supposed to be a museum to the memory of the Jewish communities in Iberia in centuries past. Memorialising may be what it does to a degree but telling the story? It doesn\u2019t",

          "This museum was just kinda weird- for the lack of a better word. Apparently it used to be about Sephardic Jews. There are still a few rooms about them. Yet there is almost no information given so unless you already know a lot about Jewish culture you're not really gonna",
          "We were eager to see a museum that tells the history of the Jews of Granada and specifically of those forced to convert to Christianity but continued to follow Judaism in secret. We were very disappointed. Most of the limited space is devoted currently to an exhibit of equipment",
          "We wandering the area and came across this small museum. The first floors were dedicated to information on the inquisition while other floors feature Jewish traditions and culture. Very interesting and emotional to see relics from the 700\u2019s.",
          "If you have a morbid fascination in torture and pain then this is the place for you. The museum tells you very little about Jewish life in Granada, and gives you the impression that the designers knew very little about it. The few explanations provided are poor and superficial.",
          "This museum is worth a stop to better understand the Inquisition and see replicas of torture instruments. Each instrument is accompanied by English/Spanish description which really helps to understand how they were used. This is an interesting secondary attraction in Granada",
          "Intriguing (and imperfect) combination of a museum on torture and Sephardic culture. Could be curated better, and the Sephardic section expanded, but an interesting and unexpected find - worth a stop.",
          "Sounded interesting, who isn't interested in torture? A place with replica and some original items of torture supposedly used during the inquisition. Some you would have seen in movies and some rather ingenious items. Plenty of explanatory notices in English which makes life",
          "Very interesting couple of hours spent here. It is mostly a museum with torture instruments but there is also a section on Jewish history (the items need more detail though) and a general overview of the Inquisition in Spain. Very interesting and good value for money. It could",
          "This 15th century palace near Plaza Santa Anna is home to superbly made full size models of instruments of torture used in the Inquisition as well as some original pieces. It's really quite gruesome reading the way these clamps, spikes, racks and whips were used, but certainly",
          "This is an interesting museum, very badly laid out. It starts off with a floor of torture instruments with some great interps on each item (although a proof-read on the English panels wouldn't have gone astray), followed by a section with Jewish (mostly religious) items with",
          "Not really a museum about the Spanish Inquisition and the history of the Jews in Spain. It is a torture museum plain and simple. My daughter and I could not look at most of the items and evening reading the details was too much. Saw a better museum and Jews in Spain and the",

          "It's a small museum, with 3 floors of displays and exhibits on the Inquisition and Jewish life in Spain. But the focus is on methods and tools of torture, and so it's a bit unsettling. All-in-all, it makes for an interesting 30 to 60 minutes (the time it takes to fully see the",
          "Probably the most graphic example you will find of man's inhumanity to man anywhere!! The torture instruments leave you in no doubt just how evil humans can be if they think they are doing it for a good cause. Each of the tools of torture used by the Spanish Inquisition and",
          "This place housed a great exhibition about the Spanish Inquisition... very informative but not for the squeamish. I remember watching a TV programme about the inquisition but to see the devices they used for torture and punishment really makes you think.",
          "Came out feeling overwhelmed due to the very graphic details of the methods of torture during the period of the Spanish Inquisition. Really well presented.",
          "Three floors of exhibits. There is a floor devoted to the Sephardic Jewish community of Granada (effectively destroyed in 1492), which we (Jewish ourselves) found unexciting. Most of the museum is devoted to the Inquisition and its tools of torture. Texts are in Spanish and",
          "I read some of the other reviews, and I'm not sure what people were expecting exactly. It IS the Inquisition Museum, so yes, if you are super sensitive about reading the gory (but true) details of history, pass it up. If, however, you want to understand more about the",
          "A museum about the forgotten Jewish culture and the Spanish inquisition. The jewish culture is a small part of the museum. If you can stomach the inquisition part then I\u2019d recommend a visit. Interesting how innovative the human race is at inventing methods to inflict pain on one",
          "I have visited the inquisition museums in Sevilla (Triana) and Cordoba as well. This one is by far the best. No white-washing or sensitivity considerations. They display and explain everything in its gory details. You won't see Catholicism the same way after this visit.",
          "I came across this museum by accident but I'm so glad I did. It had two exhibitions - one on torture instruments of the Inquisition and the other on the history of the Jews of Granada. I really enjoyed the torture exhibition - I felt it was well laid out, easy to follow and the",
          "I learned a lot about the politics of the Inquisition, the Christianisation of Spain in the 16th century, and the expulsion of the Jews and Moors. It was the best documented museum, in terms of notes next to items, that I saw in Granada.",
          "I never saw a similar museum in Granada so it was a positive and interesting surprise. A collection of torture devices, with description and explanation in both English and Spanish, that take you back in time and make you think of human cruelty (and imagination). It also houses",
          "Not sure, chaps. Struggled to rate this one. Contained what I'd expect in a museum relating to torture but was a bit nonplussed by the lighthearted Spanish soundtrack as I was looking at whips, chains and racks. Some historical context relating to the Inquisition and the Jewish",
          "Not for the faint of heart, the Inquisition exhibit is detailed and extensive. Also other areas on Jewish life in Spain prior to and shortly after the Expulsion and the Inquisition.",
          "This is the museum you DONT go to in Granada. A bizarre mishmash of inquisitorial torture devices (some real, but others are reproduction maybe fantasy?) from every century and country - with no historical context. It's all torture, salacious and intended to be shocking and",
          "I went expecting to learn more about Jewish life in Granada, but was surprised that it was mainly about torture and the Inquisition. Truly it is amazing how much imagination goes into devising ways of cruelty and slow horrible deaths, I certainly did not come away thinking we",
          "A great exposition in a beautiful building in granada. Intriguing instruments of torture and execution open your mind on how justice was practised in the old days. Recommendable to all.",
          "The first floor is devoted to instruments of torture although the focus is the Inquisition and the Jews in Sevilla at that time. The torture devices weren't all related to the Inquisition. The museum does a good job at explaining the Inquisition and its history as well as",
          "Must see for anyone wanting to learn about inquisition and religious history. The larger monuments teach you about the older islamic history and this covers some of the more recent (and really really sad) modern christian history. Important to see and learn but definitely can be",
          "We happened on this little Museum by chance and decided to visit. The first floor is a harsh reminder of man's inhumanity to man. It houses various instruments of torture used during the Inquisition with graphic descriptions of how they were used. Especially gruesome were",
          "The history of Granada and southern Spain has so many levels, and this little museum helps one to see the less glamorous side of the \"Reconquest\" of the region. From what I have been able to pick up, the three major religions lived fairly harmoniously in Andalucia from the 12th",
          "The museum was just a few steps from where we were staying, so we decided to check it out, and it was a very good decision to do just that. It was such an important reminder of the inhumane treatment we have applied to others - it was not comfortable to see the instruments of",
          "Downstairs - a ghoulish collection of instruments of torture and execution. Viewed up close, they offer an horrific reference to man's potential for cruelty. Upstairs - a touching collection of religious objects and documents relating to the life of Jewish people in Spain",
          "This museum was right next door to our hotel so we decided to visit. We were mostly keen to see the exhibition of Sephardic life in Granada, but found ourselves mesmerised and horrified at the same time by the exhibits on the Inquisition. The museum is small and on the day we",

          "I thought the exhibition of the Inquisition torture instruments might be interesting but was sad to see that my Granada Card didn't count here... Anyway : Kicked out the 5 euros... Interesting but small exhibition of mans' cruelty to man and a few highbrow and boring baubbles",
          "Exhibits give insight into the horrors inflicted on people during the Inquisition. Well presented with explanations in English and Spanish. \u20ac5 entry. Also has a varied collection of Jewish artifacts from that period. Worth a visit.",
          "We weren't sure what to expect as we didn't do much research prior to going here. It was a pleasant surprise to be able to get an in-depth understanding of the Jews of Granada. The first floor has exhibits with vivid descriptions in English as well as Spanish of the various",
          "The museum either lures you in or repulses you with its featured exhibits of tools of torture. The people who set up this museum want to remember the Jews of Granada, and devote one floor to them. But they have few artifacts from Granada itself, and include many 20th century",
          "Three days in Granada with tours of the Albayc\u00edn and the Alhambra with smart, insightful guides and I wondered, why does the Moorish influence perdure in this city on the streets, in the architecture, and in these tours, but the Jewish past seems totally overlooked? A few",

          "This privately-owned museum is one family's tribute to the Jewish families that lived in Spain and suffered under the decree of Queen Isabella in the 1490's to either convert, leave the country with nothing or be killed. It contains items of faith and daily living. There is an",
          "The story of the sephardic jews given here adds to the fascination of Granada. Although there are only a few rooms to see they are fitted out with good exhibits well documented. We felt we learned a little bit more of the history of Granada and its multi-cultural history.",
          "We came across the Palacio de los Olvidados by accident, while walking through the Albaicin in Granada after a tour of the Alhambra. A poster announced a Flemenco performance in a performance space and small museum of Sephardic Granada. Meeting the \"mother\" of the troupe and",

          "Probably they had a bad day, but our general feeling was like we visited some cheap show that recreation hotels use to animate their guests... The \"Lorca\" part had very little to do with actual Lorca... the only dancer who desired some applause was the main host of the show. The",
          "Great original performance from experienced Flamenco dancers who really convey the passion and emotion of the story through their dance. The company are like a small family and they are all talented and enthusiastic about the story they tell. The museum is interesting, showing",

          "We watched a great Flamenco show with a previous wine & sweets tasting and the visit of the museum. The actors are really good and believe in what they do and represent as a meeting place for all cultures and religions sharing a same interest: art. Impressive place run by great",

          "This museum contains some beautiful, interesting and sad items, but it would have been far more interesting if there had been some information about the social history of the Jewish community during the time they lived there and also in the period when they were being expelled.",
          "The building and the content are also interesting. Really worth to see! What's a pity that here is no Jewish community, but at least there is this museom.",
          "Round the corner of our apt we were given a great sales chat by nice guide. Very interesting little museum which also stages great looking flamenco shows in the evening. Museum is idiosyncratic but there's a sense of sadness about the way the Jews were thrown out of Spain by the",
          "We accidentally discovered this place, since it was only about 10 metres from our hotel entrance. There is no mention of this place in the DK or Rough Guide books. It was a pleasant surprise. Inside is an interesting museum of the Sephardi (Spanish Jewish) experience in Granada.",

          "Unexpected museum of the history of the Sephardic Jews, and their influence on and participation in the development of the culture and the music of Spain. Very well done presentations, guided tour helps you understand the exhibits.",
          "We had no idea this museum of Jewish history/culture in Andalusia generally (and Granada specifically) existed until we walked by it. We learned more in the hour-long tour (detailed, informative, excellent English) than we have in years of reading on our own. I encourage",
          "A fascinating collection of Jewish history around the time of the expulsion. All privately collected and funded, and the museum receives no funding from the city of Granada. Our guide Jorge told us that they had to pay the city to open the museum there! The museum is only 1",

          "We searched for the Jewish history of Granada a few years back and were delighted to find this lovely little museum on our visit this week. We booked a tour for 11am, and were the only people and so we had a personal tour with Jorge who was highly knowledgeable and had excellent",

          "The first thing I would recommend is to pay for a guide. It only costs five euros and you won't be disappointed. My friend and I got there at around eleven in the morning and there were no other people, so we had the museum and the guide to ourselves! Jorge, the guide, spoke",
          "Having studied medieval Spain this year I was interested to go to this museum to see some of the things that I had learnt about. When we arrived the man at reception told us a bit about the museum and said that there would be a guided tour which cost \u20ac5. Jorge, our guide, was",

          "This comment is about the museum and not the Flamenco show. We took the guided your and our guide, Marta was just awesome. Her explanations were totally clear and offered a real time travel. This really was the highlight of our stay in Granada. A much better experience than the",
          "This little museum, about 5 rooms, focussed on the experiences of the Sephardic Jews in the Middle Ages. There are tours in various languages but we used the English language written guide and this was fine. Plus the woman at the reception gave us a brief history of the",
          "This was such a wonderful experience. The performers passionately depicted the history of the Jews from this area.",
          "I simply wanted a decent Flamenco performance. Instead I got an amazing powerful drama beyond my expectations. I fell in love with the seductive principal dancer but her powerful anger terrified me. A woman to be loved and feared. What a story - what a wonderful introduction",
          "A great addition to Granada, this relatively new and small museum provides a glimpse into Jewish life and impact in Granada. The museum collection is small but reflects the rarity of existing pieces. It's an opportunity to learn about the Sephardic Jews as well as current",
          "I visited without taking the tour due to a lack of time but there is not enough information laid out for a 'solo' visit. I definitely recommend taking the guided tour which takes 1 hour. It would give the visit much more substance.",

          "This is a small museum, but filled with interesting relics of the Jewish past in Granada - items from synagogues and homes of the Jews and conversos (converts to Christianity during the Inquisition). There are interesting historic letters and samples of \"proof\" of lineage......",

        "wiki": "Churrigueresque (; Spanish: Churrigueresco), in a lesser extent it was also called \"Ultra Baroque\", refers to a Spanish Baroque style of elaborate sculptural architectural ornament which emerged as a manner of stucco decoration in Spain in the late 17th century and was used up to about 1750, marked by extreme, expressive and florid decorative detailing, normally found above the entrance on the main facade of a building. \n\n\n== Origins ==\nNamed after the architect and sculptor, Jos\u00e9 Benito de Churriguera (1665\u20131725), who was born in Madrid and who worked primarily in Madrid and Salamanca, the origins of the style are said to go back to an architect and sculptor named Alonso Cano, who designed the facade of the cathedral at Granada, in 1667.\nA distant, early 15th century precursor of the highly elaborate Churrigueresque style can be found in the Lombard Charterhouse of Pavia, yet the sculpture-encrusted facade still has the Italianate appeal to rational narrative. Churrigueresque appeals to the proliferative geometry and it is an intense evolution of Baroque, influenced by the same Baroque.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe development of the style passed through three phases. Between 1680 and 1720, the Churriguera popularized Guarino Guarini's blend of Solomonic columns and composite order, known as \"supreme order\". Between 1720 and 1760, the Churrigueresque column, or estipite, in the shape of an inverted cone or obelisk, was established as a central element of ornamental decoration. The years from 1760 to 1780 saw a gradual shift of interest away from twisted movement and excessive ornamentation towards neoclassical balance and sobriety. \nAmong the highlights of the style, interiors of the Granada Charterhouse offer some of the most impressive combinations of space and light in 18th-century Europe. Integrating sculpture and architecture even more radically, Narciso Tom\u00e9 achieved striking chiaroscuro effects in his Transparente for the Toledo Cathedral. Perhaps the most visually intoxicating form of the style was Mexican Churrigueresque, practised in the mid-18th century by Lorenzo Rodriguez, whose masterpiece is the Sagrario Metropolitano (1749\u201369) in Mexico City, New Spain.\n\n\n== Spain ==\nThe first of the Churriguera was Jos\u00e9 Benito de Churriguera (1665\u20131725), who trained as a joiner of altarpieces, drawing some very important for various churches of Salamanca, Madrid, Valladolid and other cities in Spain. Some in Spain have gone and some remain only a sites:\n\nNuevo Bazt\u00e1n, Community of Madrid\nChurch of St Francisco Javier and Goyeneche Palace\nSalamanca, Castile and Le\u00f3n\nAltarpiece of Convent of San Esteban\nChoir of the New Cathedral.\nPlaza Mayor.\nCapilla de la Vera Cruz\nCollege of Calatrava\nSeville\nPalace of San Telmo\n\n\n== Mexico ==\nIn Mexico, the Cathedral Basilica of Zacatecas, Zacatecas, capital of Zacatecas state, and the Templo de Santa Prisca, located in Taxco, Guerrero state are considered as masterpieces of Churrigueresque style. The building of Parroquia Antigua in Salamanca, Guanajuato, founded on August 24, 1603, was completed in the year 1690, and the Churrigueresque facade in 1740. The altarpiece of the church of San Francisco Javier (National Museum of Viceroyalty) in Tepotzotl\u00e1n, State of Mexico is also considered, along with its facade, one of the most important baroque churrigueresque works created by the Jesuits in New Spain. The Altar de los Reyes of the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral and the facades of the Sagrario Metropolitano, by the Spanish architect Lorenzo Rodriguez. which is attached to the same Cathedral, are also representatives of the style.\n\n\n== The Philippines ==\nIt was late introduced in the Philippines. The best examples were the San Juan de dios Hospital in Intramuros, Daraga Church in Albay, and Tigbauan Church in Iloilo.\n\n\n== California Churrigueresque Revival ==\n\nCalifornia Churrigueresque is a revival style native to California, developed in the early 20th century by architects Bertram Goodhue and Carleton Winslow Sr. for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition, which helped popularize its use in Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in California, and to a lesser extent the rest of the United States. Goodhue and Winslow developed the style after studying Churrigueresque and Plateresque ornamentation in Spanish Colonial buildings in Mexico. \nMany of the best examples of California Churrigeresque are located in Balboa Park in San Diego, the site of the Panama-California Exposition. Other notable buildings in this style include San Francisco's Mission Dolores Basilica, the First Congregational Church of Riverside, Los Angeles's St. Vincent de Paul Church, and Beverly Hills City Hall.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBaroque\nArchitecture of the Spanish Renaissance\nSpanish Colonial architecture\nRococo\nSpanish architecture\nMexican architecture\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliographyPevsner, Fleming and Honour, The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture, Penguin Books, Middlesex, England, 1983\nKelemen, Pal, Baroque and Rococo in Latin America, Dover Publications Inc., New York,  volumes I and II, 1967",

          "Frankly speaking, we were not expecting much, but our guide insisted so much and there we went. And thanks God we did! The \"Basilica de San Juan de Dios\" is absolutely awesome! Its construction, between 1737 and 1759, was funded by the devotees of the Hospitalier Order to house",

          "I was expecting a gaudy, display of gold but we was very pleasantly surprised with the church. As others have called out the fact that they have opened up all areas of the church to visitors is quite unique. Yes it is flamboyant and covered with gold and silver but we both were",
          "This was one of the highlights of our Granada Tour. The Cathedral is beautiful, with much impressive detail.",
          "This church is dedicated to the patron saint of Granada and is mind blowingly beautiful in all its opulence. The stunning interior of gold sculptures, gilding, silver, marble and all its adornments are at times overwhelming. The audio guide is excellent and at 5 euros is",
          "We happened upon this church and decided to take a look. It is not a large a church and it is easy to find one's way along the first floor and upstairs as well. It is strikingly filled with gold covered sculptures, adornments, and architectural swirls and twirls. The whole",
          "Beautiful church with a stunning interior. The audio self guided tour was helpful although perhaps a little pious. The relics of saints on display including Jaw bones, may be a bit off putting to some visitors.",

It\u2019s fabulous to see, mind blowing in this case, but almost too much. See it, feel it, but don\u2019t try to over think it. Not",
          "An unexpected beautiful Basilica, which in words could not describe just how breathtakingly beautiful it is. The Audio guide is lengthy, but stick with it, as it will guide you through hidden doors so you can see in full, the extent of this Basilica. It's utterly lavish, almost",
          "Has to be seen to be believed! If we could have gone round it on the correct order for the audio guide, it would all get have made more sense. As it is, you\u2019ll get as much out of just walking round without bothering with the guide - unless you really want to know who painted/",

          "An amazing place to visit. Audio guide gives lots of info. You will be astounded with the amount of gold -it is dripping in it!",

          "Well swarth a visit, the handheld sets providing a audio tour in range of languages is included in the price. If you are religious in particular ( I am not but still interesting) then I think you will greatly appreciate the history or Ferdinand and Catherine of Aragon.",
          "It'a a huge church full of objects of art, lots of silver and gold. It's centrally located in Granada and is worth to be visited.",
          "I had read several reviews and recommendations to visit on line and was not disappointed.This church is incredible and a must to visit in Granada . A short walk from the cathedral area but easy to find . Be sure to ask a member of staff to assist with access to the staircase at",

          "I have been to so many churches, and this place would not be in my top 5, but for the price, it is a lovely church to walk in and take in the grandeur of the architecture for a good 30-60 minutes of your day. We enjoyed the experience/",
          "The Basilica is wonderful, a visit to Granada would not be complete without visiting here. The intricate details are wonderful!",
          "This is a cool surprise and really cheap. Get ready with your camera because the lighting is on a timer and goes on when someone makes a donation on the lower floor. Also around the corner are a group of nuns from India who make and sell plum cakes. Great cakes,lovely people.",

          "Most amazing church I have seen in thousands all aroud the world. Sad that all this gold cost the lives and civilization of aztecs & incas, but we will not change the course of history. A must see in Granada!!!",

          "I was lucky to find this place as it was right next to the hostel I was staying in. The most well preserved ornaments of the Catholic Church in true ostentatious Baroque style, it is a feast for the eyes and the soul. Do not miss this if you are In Granada \u263a",
          "My first impression was not particularly positive. Way too much gold. Way too much. Close up not so great. However, go to the back of church and take it all in and it's much, much better, sort of like viewing an impressionist painting. Moreover, the little museum area you walk",
          "Breathtakingly beautiful Basilica. Both inspiring and awesome, many of the contents of the Basilica take your breath away. They demand much of your time if you are fully to appreciate the true beauty and the level of skill that went into the construction of this monument.",

          "Do not skip this cathedral you will never ever see another one like it: gold+gold then more gold. Unique, opulent, majestic and stunning. Yet you come out of it and ask yourself: would it be better in order to glorify a person who devoted his life to the poor and destitute to",
          "My wife and I were amazed, the audio tour is simple and you the church is a masterpiece. Everything is kept Immaculate.",

          "We came across this church by chance en route to the monasterio de san jeronimo. A service was about to begin, so we only stayed a short while. What a glorious sight. Breathtaking.",

          "Inexpensive to get in but what a beautiful place \u2026 an absolute treasure! The audio guide that was very informative and interesting.",
          "Like most Cathedrals in Europe, they tell a story about the people and their history. I would get a tour, if I did it again.",
          "An extremely opulent and lavishly decorated house of worship. Would recommend a visit if you\u2019re in Granada.",
          "We visited this Basilica on the spur of the moment. It was inexpensive and came with an audio guide that was very informative and interesting. As a world traveler, this is one of the most opulent and over the top (from a glitter/gold standpoint) that I have ever been in.",
          "My partner and I went here for a visit spur of the moment whilst we were walking around Granada. It is inexpensive to go in and well worth the visit. It is absolutely stunning and packed with history. We had the audio tour which was super interesting and learnt so much. With the",
          "As a Protestant, I do struggle with the elevation of Mary over her Son, so this is a problem - but the building is vast, elaborate and ornate. I di find space to pray. Worth the entrance fee.",
          "Not sure what you can say about a very beautiful, very old church with character galore. Even if you are not into churches, you should go and see this one.",
          "As English is not my native language I cannot find the exact proper words to describe the splendour and magnificence of this chapel. It is so overwhelming and beautiful that you wonder how human beings have been able to create this all. There is ground floor and a first floor.",
          "Being totally honest one has to be very much in tune with your religious beliefs to understand the worth of these places of worship so my comments and views are purely based on my opinions in respect of the art, architecture and sensation delivered by these places. It is truly",
          "Finding this can be a little difficult as the front doors are not used and you enter through a small courtyard sandwiched next to a large hospital so be mindful of this. However once inside the welcome is great. A small charge for the audio guide ( about\u20ac4) but it is well worth",
          "Interior design with gold is very impressive. This Basilica is really one of the most popular churches. The entrance is paid but worthwhile. I advise you to visit.",
          "I have been to many Roman Catholic Churches and Cathedrals across the mediteranean but I cannot remember any more lavishly decorated than Basilica de San Juan de Dios. This has to be a must visit for all visiting Granada. It is just amazing and mind blowing.",
          "We were just able to poke our heads in and walk around a bit in the rear of the church. There was a service happening at the time we stopped in. We would have stayed and explored this beautiful ornate church if we could have. It's near the main touristy spots so its not out of",
          "Boy every church here has something to say about \"being the first\" this or that. Funny! But see a few. Nice pomp and circumstance. Get the feeling that they used religion to control the people, not much smiling in them, lots of misery! Lots of cut off heads, death, just not",
          "In a city full of extraordinary churches, this one was a standout. All are well worth seeing, but I visited this one based on the recommendation of a cab driver and I'm glad I took his advice",
          "One of the most stunning churches I've seen (and i've been to many...). Literally every inch is covered in ornamentation, most of it gold. A bit of a hidden gem and personally prefer this to the more touristy cathedral. You get a great free audio guide with entrance ticket as",
          "One of the most ornate and ostentatious churches I have ever been in. The audio guide is included in the 4euro entry fee and can be programmed in almost any language. It takes about an hour to go through the entire guide and there is plenty to see. Great works of art,",
          "Wow...jaw dropping...incredible.. amazing. These words have all been used in previous reviews and they are all true. It's 4E well spent and there is a period starting at 1.30 when they close it. Don't miss it...it's better than the cathedral.",
          "We went inside and out, the inside was decent but I felt I enjoyed it a lot more when our tour guide (free walking tour) was talking to us about the building from the outside showing us how the architecture changed over the years depending on who was in ownership of the basilica.",

          "This is an absolute must for any visitor. I would give away a visit to the Cathedral in favour of this Basilica, it is simply amazing inside, almost too much to take in on one visit.",
          "This is a beautiful place and I would recommend visiting. However, we were quietly listening to the audio handsets in the church and without explanation were rushed through to the area upstairs then virtually chased out. There were a few of us abd some people missed even more",
          "We visited both the Basilica and the Cathedral and ended up enjoying the Basilica far more. There are fewer people around and the richly decorated Basilica is truly something to see.",
          "We were told by our B&B host about this basilica and we are so glad he did!! It is absolutely stunning!! We were extremely impressed and there was so much beauty to see. A tip he shared with us is that once an hour visitors are invited to go upstairs t ocontinue looking around",
          "This is a beautiful church to visit and a must whilst in Granada. The artworks are amazing and the many chapels are very impressive",
          "The artworks, the golden ornaments, the altar, so many things to point out in that unforgettable and remarkable site to be inscribed in my fond memories forever. Thanks for that gem in the heart of wonderful Granada.",
          "Quite a stunning interior - so much gold and silver and quite a few quirky displays of bones and skulls too. A bit frar from the main center, but worth the visit - in a non touristy neighborhood.",
          "Went to visit on a Sunday afternoon, check for opening times as we had gone earlier in the day and was closed. This is probably the most ornately decorated we have ever come across. A must see. A little out of the old town, but worth the visit. Took us about 20 minutes from",
          "Beautiful Basilica well kept and well worth a visit like so many other ones in Southern Spain no need to book unlike other similar basilicas in Spain",
          "Definitely worth a visit. There is an entry ticket of about 3 euros. The church is grand in the inside, paying for the entry fee is well worth it.",
          "The place is stunning! Coming to the church through the door in the altar, all the architecture and details and going inside the altar to see the remains and bones was absolutely a wow moment of my time in Granada! I would say, it was more interesting for me than visiting",
          "It so happened that we visited on a rainy day in early December 2017. Outside gloom and inside opulence. Don't forget to take the audio tour. It's very descriptive and you don't have to listen to it all while you walk around. It's splendor is almost nauseating. You are allowed",
          "This church is simply breathtaking. The over the top opulence is worth going. As others have said, it is really indescribable.",
          "I am going to have trouble describing the beauty of these Grenadian churches. The workmanship is awe inspiring. Every one you enter regardless of your religious beliefs makes you say \"WOW\"",
          "It surely is the most richly decorated church i've ever seen. One may like its opulence or not but is surely is worth seeing. Both the ground floor and the upper floors reachable by the stairs, offer interesting views of the decorations.",
          "I agree with Chris from London - this is really over the top. It has more gold, babies, angels, reliquaries, figurines, you name it, than any other church in Spain. Especially for a relics buff this place is extraordinary. Beyond opulent, truly fascinating and more than a little",
          "Nothing quite prepares you for the sheer opulence of this building. Opulent probably doesn't really do it justice. I've been to a lot of churches in Spain and Italy that were head-to-foot drenched in gold and silver but this church out-does most of them with bells on.",
          "not much that could be prettier than this place. breathtaking and worth the visit always glad to be inside walls like these",
          "Though I am not very religious, still, it was shocking to enter the church through the office/chambers of priests and through the altar (!). Bit like going through the whole church kitchen. The church itself is very opulent, gilded to the last edge, it is difficult to",
          "Better in our opinion than the Cathedral and the Royal Chapel. This is a gem of a church. Amazingly enough you can walk through the altar.",
          "I was not impressed with the inside of the Basilica it decoration was in my opinion way over the top. Having said that you had to admire the work and craftsmanship that had gone into the interior",
          "We actually popped in here whilst there was a service on so got a feel for the place whilst occupied. The various altars just hit you with their opulence and though I find it a bit overbearing I can appreciate it's magnificance and the feeling the locals have for it. Well worth",
          "A must visit when in Granada. To see the magnificence of this building and to marvel at the way this was constructed some 700 years ago is just mind blowing",
          "Absolutely beautiful, I've been to many churches and cathedral, but this was undoubtedly one of the most gorgeous ad intricately designed. I was surprised by the intriguing structure where we could walk through the altar",
          "Nice Spanish Basilica. The church has an entrance fee and provides you with an audio guide. It was empty when we went in December. Worth a visit when you are in Granada.",
          "One of the few places were you can approach the monuments and almost touch them Vibrant details with much history behind it Worth the visit",
          "one for the historical church lover. dripping in baroque style decorations, it is worth the visit. do borrow the audio guide to help you get all the commentaries",
          "This is an amazing Basilica. As soon as we stepped in, we were overwhelmed by the 'shine' of this place. We only had 30 minutes there before closing but we could easily spend up to 1 hour there listening to the audio guide included in the ticket price.",
          "Well, again..... we're not so lucky to visit the churches in Granada. They're usually closed in the afternoon. We arrived five minutes before closing time, just enough to catch the bling of the interior. But... when we walked next to the church, we found two patios of San Juan",
          "Interesting and gorgeous. Be sure to get the audio guide. Upstairs behind the alter are the tombs. The marble work is incredible.",
          "Don't miss this one. Incredibly ornate, Great audio tour. One of the few churches I've visited that allows you to view it from both the main level and upper level.",
          "A great piece of history, incredible decor and huge inside. It costs 5 euros which is a shame but not unusual",
          "You get an audioguide with the entrance fee. You can feel the fanaticism of the inquisition and loyality to the Catholic church in the content. If you enjoy seeing how the gold and silver taken from the American continent Mexican and Peruvian civilizations was used by the",
          "A very unexpected visit. I\u2019ve lived in Granada for 2 months and no one has told me about this wonderful place. Granada is about far more than just the Alhambra. Get a guide book and see these other beautiful places too",
          "This church was recommended by my hotel.If you are fan church interiors this is the one for you, outstanding, breathtaking beautiful opulent etc.etc.Do not forget to go up the balcony,",
          "The photos here on TripAdvisor made us discover this place. If you want to find a spectacular display of golden architecture with lots of history of artists and the supposed relics of San Juan, it's a fabulous place. The commentary on the handset is detailed and available in",
          "I was looking for something else when we found this place it\u2019s one of the best that I have seen in Spain so far it was unbelievable. When you went through the gate into the rest of the place your eyes are just going every where these are just a few of what I took. And if the",
          "What a church, I\u2019m stunned with its elegance and beauty and elaborated distinctive form of expression of faith, one of the beautiful churches in Europe.",
          "I hadn't looked at any reviews or images, just picked the Basilica out on the map as somewhere to visit. Entrance was only 5 euros each, with a very informative audio guide. As my wife will be happy to tell you rarely am I left speechless, but this place shut me up for a long",
          "This is stunning, downstairs is ok, but once upstairs you can see the whole grandeur and size. There are so many golden treasures around. You can listen to the radio guide and marvel.",
          "This cathedral is probably the best I've ever seen. Totally amazing in all regards. Well worth spending some time here",
          "We walked in, got the audio guides with the entry price of 5 Euros each. It's a good guide and a credit to the Cathedral. We enjoyed the tour and learning about the history of the cathedral, the artworks and various icons. Worth visiting.",
          "Just jaw dropping! I wish the church had more lights on for better photo op....It costs only 4 e and that includes an audio and it's truly an amazing space filled w/incredible sacral art. For Catholics also this is a church of religious significance-St John of God, a Portuguese",
          "Stupendous. Stunning. The attendant let us go up to the area above altar to see the relics, too! Don't miss...",
          "Having toured the alhambra we were ready for a beautiful Cathedral. What a disappointment.I will point out that I have visited Churches Mosques Cathedrals over much of Europe The audio guide was rambling and generally incoherent. Parts of the building were closed! They had the",
          "An amazing church full of artefacts. Overwhelmingly beautiful and so interesting. Wish we had had longer time to spend there",
          "No other way to cement your victory than building a cathedral that screams it. This church is a magnificent piece of Gothic, rennaissance and baroque architecture. Shame that during my visit there was just a handful of people worshipping......",
          "We decided to come here as it was cheaper than the cathedral, a more than reasonable \u00a34 which included a very in-depth audio guide. For those of little knowledge on local Spanish 18th century painters the audio guide was rather overwhelming. It's probably best to just put it",
          "As cathedrals go, this is far from the best in Europe--think Seville for the best, but it is still a wonderful structure (very large) and has a significant interior. It is one of the crown jewels of your tour of Granada. We were very impressed by the alter--the focal point",
          "Stumbled across this place whilst strolling through Granada and decided we may as well take a look- it is absolutely incredible and my friend and I were left speechless. It's so stunning and so interesting.",
          "Inspiring, moving, contemplative..these are the only words I can use to describe the indescribable. When someone finally deposited a euro and the lights turn on the magnificence of the alter was overwhelming. The audio guide was very well done and had to keep repeating what was",
          "What great work in this Cathedral. Beautiful well worth a visit 5 euro entry and English speaking audio for every visitor .",
          "Each church that I visited it has their own greatness I love been there, I was surprise that in Europe most their church are build like a cross",
          "Very ornate. took the tour, better than the actual Cathedral. Definate must see. The staff actually let us in prior to the published opening time, so that was nice.",
          "This is a beautiful space for a mass and in my opinion nicer than the famous cathedral! Beautiful aesthetic, as well.",
          "Wonderful artefects and great history. The place is spectacular. Good commentary giving very detailed descriptions of each section of the basilica. The tabernacle section is particularly atmospheric.",
          "This basilica was so impressive... they did not miss one detail when designing/decorating it. The gold and silver everywhere is out of this world. The audio that goes with the tour is a little long and boring (about 45 minutes) but it does give a good background and explanation",
          "on my travels I always visit churches, cathedral etc and I have been impressed by many, however, this is one cathedral that I would certainly revisit. The size and grandeur of the building is amazing. The side altars, paintings, woodwork, gold and central altar are",
          "This must be one of the most decorated churches in the world, it's dazzling. Mainly gilded wood, but also decorative tiles. It's hard to find an undecorated inch.",
          "We went to this cathedral on the last day of our trip and it was impressive. Every inch of the cathedral is lined with something to look at. It looks like the entire place is covered in gold leaf. The entrance fee is 4 euros and includes the audio guide. The fee includes the",
          "Interesting but not really worth the detour. Extravagant gilding, verbose audio guide, you could just check the images on google and be as satisfied.",
          "Excellent if you want to understand the extent of ultimate Spanish baroque architecture. Don't miss the spaces on the first floor behind the altar!",
          "Truly an amazing gem by itself. I a city where Muslim culture dominates you have the Christian gem than almost goes unnoticed. Worth the time if you have it.",
          "On our fifth day in Granada we visited the Basilica and were delighted. Take the audio tour. Incredible history and information behind everything. Nice to see the hospital attached next door as he would have wanted.",
          "Who would have guessed that behind the unassuming external facade lies one of the most ornate and glitzy altars we have ever seen? The sacristy, too, was one of the fanciest and most decorated we've seen,.",
          "This is a very interesting building with lots to see. Not my favourite style of architecture, but we still very much enjoyed our visit.",
          "A beautiful old church, steeped in history. A great way to spend an hour is so.......I highly recommend this when you visit Granada",
          "We enjoyed climbing the steep stairs to pass behind the alter., nod the view down into the body of the church. This place is a riot of golden decoration, fabulous if you like this kind of thing, maybe indigestible if you don't.",
          "The entrance 'fee' includes an audio guide in English or Spanish - well worth listening to. Lovely building.",
          "We passed this place and decided to go in and take a look. What we found inside was incredible! inside is a vast baroque church covered in gold and with plenty of marble and dark wood. It might not be to everyone's liking, but there's no getting away from the feeling of power",
          "What a gem! First of all \u2013 not many people seem to visit this place and the owners seem to trust their visitor immensely. No glass walls, no \u201cno not pass\u201d ropes, you enter the church from the altar straight onto the \u201cscene\u201d and you can even climb into the altarpiece to see the",
          "Cheap to visit - 5 euro - and comes with an audio guide which is excellent. It is huge and so well laid out. Beautifully lit which makes a change from many of the dim cathedrals in the world. Clean, great quality art and statues. Absolutely loved this place and I am an atheist.",
          "You can spend a few hours here. A truly beautiful and inspirational place. You must see this. The history is riveting, the decorations are amazing, and the music on the guide radios is simply gorgeous. Do visit this wonderful place.",
          "Great little Basilica to visit. Really well preserved and on the excessive side ( in a good way). For 4 euros a great vale. The included audio is great, but a little long winded. The figure of Jesus on the toilet was a highlight of the visit.",
          "My wife and I have always rather disliked the over-ornate late Baroque style as found in so many churches in Spain and Italy. We had expected this one simply to be the most extreme form of the same but the very extremity - plus time to kill - attracted us. WOW! It is THE",
          "It was a great surprise to find such a wonderful church. I have never had such an experience in a church. The main altar is unique as it has a little room in the middle top, which can be visited. Staff from the reception was so nice, which made the visit even more incredible. Do",
          "Well worth a visit so much to take in (headset for commentary) giving you all the information in each room of the Basilica not a spare piece of wall is not without decoration so much gold leaf and silver!!! We just stood in awe at the detail before our eyes.",
          "From the suite hotel in Gran Via it is possible to walk in 10 minutes to the Basilica. It is the most astonishing place and the wealth of the church in a poorish student area is an amazing contradiction. If one arrives at a time outside a Mass and there are mnot too many",
          "Actually with due deference to the Faithful I don't think I have seen a more Bonkers building in my life. Not one square inch of wall or ceiling is not cover by fantastic painting or gold. Actually don't think I have seen so much gold ever. A small entry fee gets you a good",
          "After Sevilla's Cathedral we were slightly disappointed but probably had been spoilt in Seville. In February it was a bit chilly but could imagine in the summer a nice place to cool down.",
          "This Church is not to be missed. We have never seen so much gold leaf anywhere. After the Alhambra i would rate this the #2 thing to visit.",
          "I have visited many churches and like this one I haven't seen. It is unbeleivable ornately decorated. You are taken aback with the high gold altar. You can take an audio guide which can explain all the history behind everything. Included in the tour is visiting the upper level",
          "Excellent presentation and access to all areas. The baroque detail is amazing. Worth the 4 euro entry price.",
          "Great cathedral with very nice paintings around the altar as well as a very nice organ in the middle.",
          "It's amazing! No other church is as ornate and gilded as this one. Don't skimp on a couple euros. Drop it in and light up the altar to fully enjoy its majesty and brilliance. Check open times; closes midday then reopens late afternoon.",
          "You definitely don't need to pay to go on a tour for a visit here; you can tour yourself. The admission is just a few Euros and you are given an audio guide. Hint: take your own headphones from your phone and plug them into the audio guide so you don't have to walk around with",
          "There was an intense audio guide and tour of an upstairs area. There was just too much to see. We spent a few euros lighting up the place with a little machine. I would have gone back if we had the chance. You never see stuff like this in the States or get a chance to be so",
          "Well worth the 1 Euro charge to light up the altar. Be sure to go when they open the upstairs wherein are the reliquary and the treasures that are amazingly beautiful. The multi-lingual audio guide is a must to appreciate the incredible detail in the architecture and",
          "This basilica is both architecturally and liturgically striking. Because of the number of chapels, one can wonder inside for a while. The central nave and sanctuary are especially impressive.",
          "There are so many amazing basilicas and cathedrals in Spain that I was worried that this would be an also-ran. However, the interior is stunning and the unusual architecture is worth checking out.",
          "All looks a bit forbidding from outside, the interior is vast and the audio guide well worthwhile to lead one through the various sections of the cathederal.",
          "We just happened upon this beautiful basilica, and felt so blessed for having done so. First of all, the basilica is a masterpiece of baroque art, but doesn't feel garish or overly done. It's just gorgeous. Secondly, it houses the relics, it's the last resting place, of St John",
          "This church doesn't seem to make the list of top attractions, but it is a gem, especially if you can get a guide to take you to the upper level and into the treasury. The decoration is just amazing, and even more so when the lights are on. There is a lot to see in this place.",
          "A fee will be charged at the entrance. Audio guide was also provided so it gives the visitor the view, understanding of the church without disturbing the sanctity of the place. The whole church is the actual masterpiece.",
          "My wife and I always see this church when we visit Granada because it is so very beautiful. It is the most beautiful church in the city and the main altar is stunning. There is a new light show that is very good and it has music to go with it. One should also go to the camarin",
          "You think when you've seen one church you've seen them all. Well you haven't. The baroque interior was stunning. We were lucky to go right up to the silver tabernacle containing the remains of Juan de Dios. Had an amazing experience and only 4 euros. A must see.",
          "Only time for a very short look at this but so beautiful - statues and \"gold\" everywhere so was very sorry my look at this was so short - only had few hours in Granada.",
          "Well worth the 4 \u20ac admission price that includes an audio guide. Note that you can use that pause button on each number because there are so many items being described that I found you could not keep up with the commentary and give proper viewing to the interesting items. As",
          "This is a must see in Granada. I would say, skip the Cathedral and see this instead. It is 4 euros to enter, but includes an audio guide. The alter is not always illuminated, but for 1 euro you can illuminate it. It is well worth it because it is stunning when lit up. About",
          "Lovely place with steps, no ramps, lots of history. You must take your time walking though this holy place because you do not want to miss any of the history.",
          "We arrived on a rainy day and decided to venture inside...and Wow! We found a stunning cathedral with classic art. It was a most enjoyable tour. They provide audioguide with entry fee. Probably number 2 in Granada only behind Alhambra! Enjoy!",
          "Took a walk this morning to find this church based on the other reviews. It did not disappoint. Unbelievable opulence and incredible access to all the areas of the altar, sacristy and treasury room. Lots of relics from the saints and just draw-dropping beauty. If you want to",
          "The basilica opens at 10am. It looks nothing from the outside but when you step inside it will blow you away! At 11am the upper level was opened for us, very special!",
          "a must visit - so ostentatious and access all areas church which is unusual, cheap to enter and better than a lot of churches - audio guide as well brilliant",
          "This basilica is one of the most amazing churches we have ever visited. It's opulence with an interior completely covered with ornate gilded carvings is a shock after the plain exterior and is even more stunning if you put a euro in the box at the front which then lights up the",
          "Wow. Deserves a visit and the 4 euros ticket price. The voice of the audioguide is too boring and it's clear the priests of the Church had a say on that. If you want a more artistic focus, look at your guide! Don't miss the treasure room, filled with silver and gold, where the",
          "Although I'm not religious you can't help feeling moved by this basilica. If anything find it hard to take it all in. Definitely worth the visit though.",
          "You must see the Basilica Inside, so impressive. They also bring you upstairs up close to the remains of San Juan de Dios. Like nothing you have seen before. I enjoyed it more than visiting the Cathedral.",
          "Worth a look, even if not particularly religious. It is quite large, and slightly outside the central old town.",
          "Situated bang in the downtown area of Granada, you can't miss this place when you are coming down after seeing the Alhambra. There are no entry fees and the Church remains open at certain times. The grandeur you face is unbelievable inside this little church which appears to be",
          "Were recommended to go there but didn't expect much as we had grown to enjoy the Muslim art a bit more than the Catholic one as part of our Andalucia tour...but it's really exciting! I mean really really. You can get super close to the relics of St John and other Saints that are",
          "For 5Euro you get a visit with recorded guide. Really impressive complex of churches, and great works of art and architecture.",
          "San Jaun de Dios (St John of God, apparently) is meant to be the Patron Saint of Children and so this building used to be a children's hospital. The architecture and general layout is quite impressive and the mosaic floor and fountain in the middle provides nice detail. We",
          "The architecture is amazing and all the paintings and monuments inside very interesting to look at. Probably no good for kids as ours got bored. Make sure you go as a couple and don't take kids.",
          "Well maintained place of worship. Glorious metalwork, shimmering in the sunlight. Cool interior. Not always open.",
          "The Basilica's outside may not be very spectacular, but the inside certainly is. Huge, baroque and very special indeed.",
          "Very nice, cheap, good audioguide, very polite staff. Must visit. Not distante from center city. One of best Place of granada.",
          "Coming from Seville I did not have much expectations. Boy was I wrong. The work inside the church is just fascinating. Wether you like the style or not you cannot but appreciate the craftsmanship that has gone into this church. Yes it is too ornate and really busy but well worth",
          "The Basilica is large and detailed within. There is a lot of sculpture, relief and glasswork. Audio reference is also provided for those that wish it",
          "This basilica was grand but it's heavy baroque style in such a small space was overwhelming. You could actually get close to the Holy Relics so that was very amazing. We got there late and it was almost ready to close. The lady working was so incredibly nice that she let us go",
          "Spain is full of Amazing Cathedrals. Perhaps this may not be the finest, but its certainly worth a visit. Its not as rich and laden with the art of some of its more famous cousins. But that may be one of its charms. A Spiritual Space of quiet and reflection. The Ambulatory",
          "Nearly walked past this stunning church - really worth a visit! The gold alter is about 30 feet high surrounded by a dark, but stunning church. I sat mesmerized looking around me, talking in everything. Never seen a church like it!",
          "The visit to the cathedral is well worth it. It is stunning inside and not expensive. the artwork is beautiful, highly recommended.",
          "As another reviewer mentioned, this cathedral is truly under-rated. I was blown away by the beauty of it. It was one of the first cathedrals done in a Renaissance style. The white and gold layered interior look ethereal. It is highly decorated without being overdone (unlike",
          "One of the best cathedrals that I have seen . The audio guide provided is excellent and explains everything very interestingly . The grandeur and the pomp of Christianity and the opulence of Spain is impressive . The combination of art and religion is beuatiful . A must see .",
          "From the outside you would have no idea of the grandeur waiting for you inside. Entry is \u20ac4, but for that you also get an audio guide, which I would recommend using. The audio tour takes about 30 minutes and provides plenty of detail concerning the basilica and its contents.",
          "A typical Spanish cathedral, but with an audio guide included in the admission price. There is a lot to see, but not as impressive as the Mesquita in Cordoba, or typically cathedrals in France or the UK. Note entry here does not include the Royal Chapel, which seemed",
          "so much history at this amazing place, we will definitely visit it again when when we go back to Granada.",
          "Worth a visit at 5 Euros, which includes the audio guide. It took us over an hour to go round. Easily found by getting off the tourist train at bus stop 8.",
          "Amazing building with a host of history. Very highly decorated and dripping with Icons and gold with speak/phone type guideing if you want it.",
          "This feels like a unique place dedicated to the founder of the order of hospitallers who spent his life in charity and good works. It is extremely highly decorated with stories detailing the reasons behind the decorations of chapels, sacristy and main church. Another fascinating",
          "This basilica is certainly worth a visit, the finish is awesome and the atmosphere a very reverent place. We went at about midday which allowed us the opportunity to miss the crowds and the congregation.",
          "I like visiting old churches, and this was a winner for me. Kind of Rococo ambiance with flourishes not often found elsewhere. Not the biggest church, but simply one of the stunning. Visited by attending Sunday 8:30 mass, very simple, about 40 minutes long.",
          "It's pretty enough. But I only went in because I felt compelled to do so. It's ornate; it's lovely; but it's not really my 'thing'. I was happier walking the streets outside than being cooped up inside. But that's just me.",
          "I took so many photos in this venue .... This place is awesome! Very impressive. Make sure to get there early - so much to take in.",
          "The amount of gold in this Basilica is unbelievable. One can only imagine how spectacular this would have been to the average person in centuries past. The amount of work the artists dedicated to this one of a kind sanctuary is impressive. No photos can ever come close to",
          "The architecture and artefacts inside the church are difficult to describe as words would not make justice to this environment. If you visit Granada, you must go to the Basilica.",
          "Having visited many churches and cathedrals across the world, this has to be one of the most amazing! From the outside it looks like any other church except for the beautiful dome, once inside we were just blown away! It is incredible, we have never seen so much gold! There is",
          "Peaceful, stunning and a must see if you want to see a good example of baroque style. It feels a bit over the top because it is only a small church but worth the visit.",
          "A \u20ac4 fee includes an audio guide. So over the top, it's a cross between stunning and obscene! So much to look at and so much gold. Old books, stunning old blue tiles, beautiful silver... The painting on the curved chapel ceilings just gorgeous and a lovely break from the gold.",
          "Interesting half hour or so. Well kept and fabulous building. Avoid the beggars hanging around outside!",
          "Do yourself a huge favour and pay a visit to the Basillica - its truly beautiful and such a calming and awe inspiring place.",
          "I've seen a number of Basilicas and this has to be one of the best. Very ornate and the Basilica had a lovely peaceful feel.",
          "Pretty cathedral but not as good as Seville in my opinion . The audio tour was good and included in five euros admission fee",
          "I never get bored with visiting cathedrals they all have their own individual charm and this one does not disappoint. Located in the center of Old Granada, fortunately we had the services of a guide. it is so ornate, lovely mosaics, paintings and carvings, l do not think that l",
          "A very enjoyable visit in the centre of old Granada. Amazing details in the building. We did a self audio tour which lasts about 40 minutes.",
          "What an unbelievable place. When you switch on the lights and see it in it's full glory it is magnificent, if also not a little galling at the amount of money that must have been spent on it. We were lucky to be allowed upstairs to the balcony areas and that provides an amazing",
          "Absolutely awe-inspiring. Worth paying for a p.a. system. Even if you are not a Catholic, you cannot but admire the splendour. We were fascinated with the giant-sized hand written and illustrated manuscripts. Take your time an experience not to be missed.",
          "This is well worth a visit. The architecture and internal embellishments are amazing. Cues can be long at certain times, so try to get there early or go with a tour guide.",
          "If you want over the top Baroque, this is the place. There was enough gold and flash to impress anyone.",
          "Whatever your beliefs or ideas on religious buildings this is a must see. The extreme opulence of the basilica is something else. There is hardly a spare piece of wall that is not covered with gilding, painting, mosaic, carving etc. It is rather a lot to take in however long you",
          "Totally garish and in the worst possible taste- can't imagine who would think this was suitable for a place of worship. It's so awful you just have to go see it for yourself. And you need never bother with it ever again!",
          "No they are not all the same these cathedrals; but they are all quite amazing. For a Frenchman, paying for visiting churches and even finding daytime closed doors is a novelty.",
          "One if the nicest church I have seen in my life. Amazing what man can do when they are inspired. A must to see. The visit is also very well organized, you will be able to go within the main Altarpiece . Thank you to the kind persons who where at the reception.",
          "A brief visit here during mass, the altar is amazingly opulent and much more impressive than the cathedral.",
          "This little Basilica is the jewel in Granada's crown. Nestled next to the hospital, and 4\u20ac to enter, it's well worth it. It's initially dark but once you hit the light switch, the wall behind the alter is alive with gold detail. It's a very impressive little church and worth a",
          "This Basilica in the centre of Granada is one of the must-sees in the town. The interior is just incredible. Now we know where the Aztec gold ended up as it seems the entire interior is coated in gold leaf. It might not be to everyone's taste but the sheer extent of the",
          "----This Church just blew us away! It is the most fabulous example of Spanish baroque architecture and worth every penny of the \u20ac4 entrance fee.",
          "When you go to Granada everyone goes to the main cathedral which is beautiful and should be visited, but Basilica de San Juan de Dios is like nothing I have ever seen. A gorgeous church with a very reasonable entrance fee which includes an audio recorder.",
          "Maybe not the most impressive cathedral -- compared to Sevilla or the stunning Mezquita/ Basilica of C\u00f3rdoba -- but still a recommendable place to see when in Granada. The entrance is included in the Granada Card, which covers the Alhambra, the Capilla Real and said basilica",
          "Unbelievable architecture. The money spent on this church came from gold and silver collected in the new world. The art work is breathtaking.",
          "Even if you are not religious, this is a very interesting church to have a look at. Well worth the EUR 4 entrance fee.",
          "I say hmmm as yes it was worth a visit. It is beautiful inside however the use of so much gold made you realise just how much was spent on such a place..",
          "At a visit to this church you cannot believe what you're seeing. The ornamentation and treasures being shown there are incredible. It' s a small church but very impressive. So a visit there is worth it.",
          "I thought I'd hit heaven after touring Granada's awesome main cathedral but that turned out to be just the beginning. This church was even grander, almost over the top, so much gold, so much art, so many doo-dads to feast the eyes on! But simply amazing to contemplate as both a",
          "The story of San Juan de Dios is fascinating and could be made into a movie, it was so full of dramatic moments. This beautiful baroque church is definitely worth seeing as you seek the history of Granada, and of this Saint.",
          "The Basilica of St. John of God, which contains the tomb of the saint who founded the order of the Hospitaler Brothers, was very inspirational for me. I loved the religious artwork and statuary and was completely awestruck by the tomb of the saint. The audio tour was very",
          "You will be awed by the sheer amount of ornamentation and elaborate paintings. No wall or item is left plain. The audio guide that comes with entry is semi-interesting but long. 4 stars because I couldn't shake the weird feeling I got as I walked through the basilica. It felt",
          "I have always made it a point to visit churches whenever I travel. This one certainly will not disappoint.",
          "Though smaller in size than other religious buildings in Granada (like the Cathedral) it certainly makes up for it in impact. Brilliantly decorated, it's a spectacular tour which features stunning altar pieces, some modern in style as well as some impressively presented",
          "Visit for a brief respite from the bustle of Granada. No particular features to mention but very nice",
          "There is only the central part of the catherdal that has been renovated and the rest is badly neglected. My town experienced a destructive earthquake in 2011 and since then the beautiful churches have been renovated. They are loved and cherished for their historic importance to",
          "The Basilica has the most breathtaking architecture and details. It's definitely one of the most interesting places in Granada.",
          "By far the most spectacular Baroque monument in Granada. This hidden church is full of relics, gold and heavy decorations. You may like it or not, anyway you will be amazed. Not so many tourists. Worth the visit.",
          "This is a truly fantastic example of Andalusian baroque. Has to be seen to be believed. Audio guide provided plus helpful staff.",
          "It's really was amazing! Worth to visit. Built and decoeated in baroque style mid of 14th century, lot of gold, beautiful wooden statues, paintings. Only for 4\u20ac entrance fee you get audioguide and possibility to visit area behind altar, to see all the beautiful decoration",
          "An over-the-top gorgeous church! The decoration is incredible and fills just about every inch of the church. This is a must-see in Ronda.",
          "Stumbled upon this little gem by accident and what a treat it turned out to be. Our guide spoke excellent English and was very informed regarding the contents of the museum. Even if your are not a religious person the art and artefacts from the 15th and 16th century are",
          "Can you cancel this one. Wrong church. I don't know how to get back out of this so can you just forget I did this.",
          "Fell on this church by accident (at the side of the San Juan Hospital). It was well worth the 4\u20ac entrance charge and they gave you an English commentary box to take around. The church is breath taking and stunning. Whilst walking around a lady called to us and took us into",
          "3 euros to enter and it is beautiful and historical in the inside, the intricate designs of the sculptors and images are just amazing It is worth to see and by the way they prohibit you taking photos and videos but others seems not following the rules... Hey.. It's a privilege",
          "Having read the reviews about this church we made the very wise decision to take a look while in Granada. It was absolutely amazing. I don't understand why it is so under publicised and hence was a little difficult to find but so worth the visit.",
          "The sheer amount of gold is an overwhelming and awesome sight to behold. The best way to enjoy the church is to take a pew and soak up the view. The following short tour behind and above the altar is equally spectacular. The exterior of the building does not convey the wonder",
          "This is another must visit especially if you are staying at the Hesperia or another nearby hotel in Granada. It would be a shame not to see",
          "From the outside it just looks like another building, but the inside is amazing. We also found it better value for money than the main cathedral. You just have to go and see it.",
          "Magnificent alters, choir stalls and decoration in the side chapels.Beware that this cathedral may not be open to the public on Sundays and there is still work going on to restore the roof/outer walls and there is a dedicated entrance and exit on the opposite side which is not",
          "Basilica de San Juan de Dios was beautiful and interesting. I have never seen so much gold in my life. The sculpture was great. There is a beautiful garden and a nice quiet atmosphere in the heart of Granada",
          "It's a must see in Granada. From the outside it doesn't look much but inside it'e really wonderful. The statues of the saints are the most beautiful I've seen anywhere. All the Basilica glows with gold and silver. On top and behind the altar are the relics of the saint in a huge",
          "We arrived on a Monday so this was closed. We had gone to the cathedral which was very nice and a change from the gothic style we had been seeing. On a strong recommendation by our hotel they said we must go to this... We were not disappointed. Much smaller, but packed with",
          "don't miss this - just a wonderful experience. I spent a good hour just looking and admiring the most wonderful chapels, statues and architecture",
          "Wonderful Basilica dedicated to S. Juan de Deus, the statues are the most beautiful i've ever seen, and the many altars very rich. On the top are the relics of the saint.",
          "This is a must see in Granda, The splendor and ornate quality of the Basilica inside are largely concealed by its humble surroundings and street view,",
          "This was by far the best place we visited in Granada. Simply mind blowing. You must see it to believe it.",
          "I have traveled a lot and seen so many churches but so far this one is the most extravagant/beautiful of all of them. There is a small fee but totally worth it. The entrance money goes to feed the poor in Granada",
          "I was already impressed as I looked around the sanctuary, but I was even more amazed when we were lead upstairs to the relics room behind the main altar. On your way up, be sure to look at the blue ceramic decorations along the wall! I really liked the use of mirrors in the",
          "Very interesting to see. Free audio guide is a plus. Definitely religion taken over the top. You can wait for a tour of the top, every ten minutes or so. Worth the wait. While in Granada you should see this. \u20ac4 each to get in. Nice clean bathrooms too. Another plus.",
          "I remember my jaw dropping as soon as I walked into the Basilica. It is worth a visit simply for the grandeur and beauty. I know there are a lot of cathedrals and churches to see in Spain, but if you're going to see one, this is the one to see!!!",
          "Totally amazing & stunningly beautiful...Its size is awesome...The gorgeous interior will completely blow you away! I am not particularly religious but I felt humbled here...Lots of bars/restaurants nearby too...",
          "Well worth the steep climb for some stunning views of Granada. The Basilica has a guide who takes you through its history. Well worth the visit.",
          "Very gold, very shiny, wear sunnies. A worthwhile see in Granada. you need about 30 mins to see the Basillica. it is really ornate but worthwhile!",
          "City centre cathedral, easy to find and worth while seeing while in Granada. Magnificent things to see in the interior, and exterior is also worth taking photos.",

          "Don't miss this church...it is gorgeous on the inside, but it is the church that was promised by Isabel when she prayed to God for assistance. Again, great stories & history.",
          "We were on our way to the nearby Monastery which turned out to be closed for siesta so we walked a few minutes to the Basilica. 4euros each, which includes an audio guide. Hardly anyone else there, we counted 4 others during our visit. First room is nice but nothing, and I",
          "One of the most spectacular Basilicas I have seen. 4 Euro entry fee but well worth it! plus its a great way to get out of the hot sun! to get the full experience it would be good to get an audio guide - however it is beautiful to walk around and admire the sheer size of the",
          "A fantastic, breathtakingly ornate church. Churrigueresque, being the formal title. This church is a great contrast to the monastery of San Jeronimo round the corner and you can usefully visit both in a morning. Yes it costs a whole 4 euros. It's worth it!",
          "If you like old and totally ornate churches don't miss this one. The altar is totally covered in gold leaf, statues and paintings all around. You will take an inexpensive self guided tour at your own pace and will be able to appreciate the beauty of this chuch.",
          "We really enjoyed this more than the Alhamra - it is absolutely beautiful on the inside!!! We rented those \"whisper\" gadgets which were super. They worked extremely well. This is just a beautiful place - one of the prettiest that we saw in France, Spain, or Portugal.",
          "Not on a regular tourist route but this beautiful basilica was astounding. I can only mirror the positive reviews others have said. A must go",
          "This church is not included with the Granada Card, but it was well worth the small entrance fee. It's a baroque church with some really beautiful chapels. You also get to visit some areas up behind the altar which have some really beautiful artifacts. I went on Sunday afternoon",
          "It's hard to describe the visual aspect: impressive, magnificent etc. Don't recall if the audio guide was included in the price but it's worth it, especially with children.",
          "My wife and I stayed in Granada near the train station and had some time in the morning before our afternoon ticket to the Alhambra. I checked out nearby locations and saw the larger circle for this church. Figured it was worth the walk after reading some reviews. It is worth",
          "The basillica looks deceivingly plain from the outside, however, from the moment you enter the baroque architecture is stunning. Personally, I prefer the basillica to the cathedral and the free audio guide provided is an added bonus.",
          "Quite an impressive cathedral and a must see when in Granada. It does not seem as big from the outside but was quite immense when inside the cathedral.",
          "For the people who enjoy baroque art, this is a good example, with lots of golden pieces. It is worth a visit.",
          "This is not a big church, but there is more gold all around than in Cathedrals 10 times larger. Was lucky to have the place to myself for the first 10 minutes of it opening, which was perhaps just as well as I think I just had a Hugh silly grin on my face for most of my time in",
          "It cost 4 \u20ac per person and gave us an audio device. I took lots of pictures so I didn't listen much. Lots of stairs up and then down to leave. So it might be a challenge if you have walking problems.",
          "This place is really amazing.....everything that has been said about it ..is true. The silver and gold has to be seen. You need to take the audio phones as it does explain everything about this gorgeous place. We think the best place we went to in Granada.",
          "Didnt dislike anything, well except the representation of the Devil on the statue of Michael the Archangel. loved all the putti (little cherub or sometimes translated as chubby children) the religious iconography and the church itself.",
          "Have never seen a church like it - absolutely and utterly dripping in gold and relics. Really quite a sight and well worth the 3 Euros to get in",
          "Quite possibly the least touristic-but right up there as one of the top things to experience in Granada. I've seen many many churches and Cathedrals but this will amaze even the most jaded, fatigued, over toured burned out sightseer. Excellent self tour (Audio) is comprehensive",
          "We visited today and my husband and I were both completely overwhelmed by this place. Neither of us are particularly religious, well not at all in fact, but my gosh....the first thought in my mind was \"Oh my God!\"..... As I have said in a few other reviews, we are Australians",
          "This small baroque basilica is a jewel with no space left not embellished. The audio guides in various languages provide an excellent description both of the church and of the life of St John of God. We had gone to the museum of St John of God, just by chance, earlier that",
          "I had such a wonderful time. This and the one in Sevilla were absolutely amazing. I would recommend coming and seeing all the beautiful jewels and crowns that are kept in the museums.",
          "This is easily the most beautiful over the top Church I have ever seen. A real feast for the eyes and a wonderful history. It is a monument to 'love and charity'. Entrance was 4 euros and that included an audio machine. Excellent value for money. You can put a euro in a machine",
          "I have seen some churches in my time but this really takes the biscuit. Gothic and more! It is a real feast for the eyes, and you just don't know where to look. The audio guide is free, and whilst I am not normally a fan of them, you will need it! There were few people here,",
          "This Basilica is a must to visit it is a very Beautiful Church and has such an interesting History . Don't miss out at lighting up the Main Alter it is well worth the 1 euro in the slot quite awe inspiring",
          "Very glamorous Jesus and holy Mary statutes. Awesome architecture and interior design, cannot image the extravagant design throughout whole church.",
          "One of the many churches in Granada, buth breathtaking. All in one style. Maybe to rich for a man who dedicated his live to the poor, but a must seen",

          "This is a must see while in Granada.  The splendor of this church is almost beyond comprehension.  To enter, you have to go through the garden gate just to the right of the church's main entrance.  There is a 3 Euro admission that comes with a free audio guide.  From the time",
          "Like others I saw this church on tripadvisor when researching things to do in Granada. I put it close to the top of my list, and I'm so glad we made time to see it! We climbed the stairs to where the Saints' relics are kept first. The stairway itself is beautiful, painted and",
          "nicer than any cathedral in Rome except the Vatican. What is amazing is the ability to go in areas usually roped off. Not in major tourist area either. As ornate ad you'll ever see.",
          "I saw this church here on trip advisor and decided I must see it. Now apparently it is high Baroque architecture so technically it should be the 'high' end of the Roman Catholic Faith. Every square inch of every surface is designed to overpower you sense of touch and sight and",
          "The interior of this church is incredibly ornate. The gilded altar is a site to behold. Definitely a must see when walking around the city. We took a ton of pictures.",
          "This church is amazing in its Baroque extravagance. Every inch seems to be covered with gold, silver, or some kind of artwork. I've never seen anything quite so elaborate. When you step into the main sanctuary it takes your breath away.",
          "If you're looking for over the top, this is the place for you! In every corner there's gold gold & more gold. The inside is huge & you can really get a glimpse of the old church splendour. An added plus is that there were no tours which tend to take over every possible sight",
          "You may you've been churched out in Granada, but it's certainly worth looking this one out for the sheer opulence of it. You will probably never have seen so much gold all in one place. You can see the urn which holds the remains of San Juan de Dios behind the altar from the",

          "This was a surprise. It was tucked away just off the Gran Via. I would suggest a look at a website explaining the Juan de Dios before going but I was overawed by the beauty inside the church. It is well worth seeing and it was free entry..",

        "wiki": "The  Madrasah of Granada (Spanish: Madraza de Granada, also Yusufiyya, Casa de la Ciencia, Palacio de la Madraza) was a Madrasah or mosque school in Granada, Andalusia, Spain. It was founded in 1349 by the Nasrid monarch Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada. The building is currently part of the University of Granada and is the seat of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Angustias (\"Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Our Lady of Sorrows\").It is located on the street now known as Calle Oficios. The madrasah was built at the heart of the city, near the main mosque (now the site of the Granada Cathedral) and the Alcaicer\u00eda, then the elite bazaar where silk, gold, linen and other cloth were traded. Ibn al-Khatib was an early student there; among his teachers were Ibn al-Fajjar, Ibn Marzuq, and Ibn al-Hayy (language and law); Ibn al-Hakam and the poet Ibn al-Yayyab (rhetoric); and Sheik Yahya ibn Hudayl (medicine and philosophy).\n\n\n== Curriculum ==\nAmong the subjects taught were theology, law, medicine, astronomy, logic, mathematics including geometry, and mechanics.Ibn Hazm (Fisal) gives us some indication of the curriculum of the \"Andalusian school of philosophy\": \"Consecrate the first fruits of your intelligence to mathematics and begin your scientific education by his deep study of the properties of numbers. Then gradually pass to consider the position of the stars, the apparent shape of the celestial sphere, how to verify the passage of the sun, moon and five planets (\u2026) all other phenomena and accidents physical and atmospheric. Add to this the reading of certain books of the Greeks in which they determine the laws governing discursive reasoning.\"\n\n\n== The building ==\n\nAs was typical of the works of Yusuf I, the building was splendid, with a white marble entrance whose remains are now in the Archaeological Museum of Granada. The building was originally organized around a pool in the center.The fa\u00e7ade was decorated with inscriptions of poetry and philosophy. Among these were the words \"If in your spirit you provide a place for the desire to study and to flee from the shadows of ignorance, you will find in it the beautiful tree of honor. Make study shine like stars to the great, and to those who are not, bring to them the same brilliance.\"After the completion of the Reconquista and the conversion to the Cabildo an adjacent house was annexed to enlarge the building. The octagonal Mud\u00e9jar Sala de Cabildos was constructed in this era; its 1513 decoration included an inscription alluding to the Christian conquest of the city. Eventually the pool was filled in and converted to other uses, although even after the modifications of 1554\u20131556, Francisco Henr\u00edquez de Jorquera describes a patio with a pool and a garden. The building was subject to major modifications, especially in the 1722\u20131729 at the height of the Baroque, so that what we have today is essentially an 18th-century building with elements of older buildings. The oratory or mihrab is original from the 14th century; the Sala de los Caballeros XXIV is Mud\u00e9jar.The building, which belongs to the University of Granada, underwent extensive archeological excavations in 2006\u20132007. In 2011 the building reopened to the public.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Madrasah functioned as a university until late 1499 or early 1500, under the Treaty of Granada (1491), under which the sultan Boabdil of the Emirate of Granada surrendered to the Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella. However, events in Granada drastically changed archbishop Hernando de Talavera's benign proselytizing methods. In 1499, an uprising by Muslims in the region of Alpujarras paved the way for Gonzalo Jimenez de Cisneros, as inquisitor-general, to intervene in Talavera's diocese. Following this, the 1491 Treaty of Granda was unilaterally declared null and void by Isabella and Ferdinand's government. Cisneros took advantage of the situation to assault the Madrasah, the contents of whose library was brought to the plaza of Bib-Rambla and burned in a public bonfire. Once pillaged and closed, the building was designated in 1500 by Ferdinand II to be the new Casa del Cabildo (city hall).In 1858 the town hall moved to the Plaza del Carmen, and the building was sold to be used as a textile warehouse. Two years later, the principal inscription of the Mihrab was discovered. There was also some fire damage in this era; the Echeverr\u00eda family, owners of the building, hired Mariano Contreras, the same architect who restored the Alhambra, to undertake the repairs.The city bought back the building in the early 20th century, leading to further restoration work in 1939. There was an unsuccessful attempt in 1942 to turn the building into the seat of a new Instituto de los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos del Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (\"Catholic Monarchs Institute of the Superior Council of Scientific Investigations\"). In 1976, the building became part of the University of Granada.\n\n\n== Archeology ==\nThe archeological excavations in 2006\u20132007 turned up various remains, including traces of older buildings on the site dating back as far as the 11th century. Two human burials were identified beneath what is now the oratory. They certainly date back at least to the 11th century, and possibly as far back as Roman times, though most likely they date from after the Umayyad conquest of Hispania.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMattei, Luca (2008), \"Estudio de la Madraza de Granada a partir del registro aqueol\u00f3gico y de las metodolog\u00edas utilizadas en la intervenci\u00f3n del 2006\" (PDF), @rqueolog\u00eda y Territorio (5): 181\u2013192, retrieved 2010-01-23 Includes architectural plan, photographs of the archeological excavations, and images obtained with Ground Penetrating Radar.",

          "Consider this an introduction to what you will see in the Alhambra, albeit on a much smaller scale. The inside architecture is amazing. My wife and I visited in October 2015 and had the place virtually to ourselves at the time. We enjoyed a short and informative discussion",
          "Very interesting place with colors of the walls still preserved due to being boarded up with wood for hundreds of years. Something that is not present in Alhambra. But gives you a pretty good idea of how things looked",

          "Went to Madraza, which is near the Cathedral and the Royal Chapel, for a short tour. It is a small place with Moorish architecture. It has well preserved colors, which is the only reason for going here, I would think. The tour guide spoke English, but was a little difficult",
          "Just a few euros for a guided visit of the building. The mihrab is beautiful and provides insight in to what some of the rooms at the Alhambra looked like in the past. Due to being covered with plaster for a long time the original colours of the ceiling have been very well",

          "We came here by chance and werde not disappointed. The Guy made the tour in Spanish and English, we learned a lot!",
          "Well worth the 2 Euro entrance fee for the guided tour around the building. There isn't a huge amount to see, but the preservation means that you start to get a fuller idea of exactly how impressive the Alhambra would have been when the original colours were still present.",
          "Only \u20ac2 per adult (kids are free) its worthwhile taking a few minutes to view this place. First a madrasah for Muslim professors and students - the architecture is stunning! Then a city council when the Christian monarchs - great paintings, then a home for a rich family, it is",

The house remains basically the same as it was..\nFederico Garc\u00eda Lorca wrote there some of his most famous masterpieces, such as Blood wedding (1932) and Yerma (1934). \nHe was in the house for many of the days prior to his assassination, before travelling to the house of his friend Luis Rosales.\nThe Garc\u00eda Lorca family had to leave Spain in 1941 because of the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, and moved to the United States. However, they still owned the estate.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nOn 6 April 1985, Isabel Garc\u00eda Lorca gave the estate up to the city of Granada in order to establish a museum dedicated to the poet. \nThe art centre was inaugurated on 10 May 1995.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nFederico Garc\u00eda Lorca\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

The Port of Algeciras is one of the largest ports in Europe and the world in three categories: container,\ncargo and transhipment. It is located 20 km north-east of Tarifa on the R\u00edo de la Miel, which is the southernmost river of the Iberian peninsula and continental Europe. In 2015, it had a population of 118,920.\nIt is the biggest city among those of its metropolitan area that also includes the municipalities of Los Barrios, La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n, Castellar de la Frontera, Jimena de la Frontera, San Roque and Tarifa, with a population of 263,739.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe site of Roman cities called Portus Albus (\"White Harbor\"), Caetaria (current Getares) and Iulia Traducta. In the later \"Byzantine\" period, the site would come to be known in Greek as \"Mesopotamenoi,\" meaning \"between rivers/canals,\" which the invading Arabs would then translate to \"al-Djazirat,\" of similar meaning. \"Al-Djazirat\" gave the modern Spanish \"Algeciras.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area of the city has been populated since prehistory, and the earliest remains belong to Neanderthal populations from the Paleolithic era.\nDue to its strategic position it was an important port under the Phoenicians, and was the site of the relevant Roman port of Portus Albus (\"White Port\"),\nwith two nearby cities called Caetaria (most likely Iberians) and Iulia Transducta, founded by the Romans.\nRecently it has been proposed that the site of Iulia Transducta was the Villa Vieja of Algeciras.After being destroyed by the Goths and their Vandal allies, the city was founded again in April 711 by the invading Moors, as the first city created by the Amazigh (Berbers) on the occupied Spanish soil.In the year 859 AD Viking troops on board 62 drekars and commanded by the leaders Hastein and Bj\u00f6rn Ironside besieged the city for three days and subsequently laid waste to much of it. After looting the houses of the rich, they burnt the Aljama mosque and the Banderas mosque. Reorganized near the medina, the inhabitants managed to recover the city and make the invaders run away, capturing two boats.\nIt enjoyed a brief period of independence as a taifa state from 1035 to 1058. It was named al-Jazirah al-Khadra' (\"Green Island\") after the offshore Isla Verde; the modern name is derived from this original Arabic name (compare also Algiers and Al Jazeera). In 1055 Emir Al-Mutadid of Seville drove the Berbers from Algeciras, claiming it for Arabs.\nIn 1278, Algeciras was besieged by the forces of the Kingdom of Castile under the command of Alfonso X of Castile and his son, Sancho IV. This siege was the first of a series of attempts to take the city and ended in failure for the Castilian forces. An armada sent by Castile was also annihilated whilst trying to blockade the city's harbor.\n\nAfter many centuries of Muslim rule, the tide of the reconquista arrived at Algeciras. In July 1309 Ferdinand IV of Castile laid siege to Algeciras as well as Gibraltar. The latter fell into Christian hands, but Muslim Algeciras held on for the following three decades, until Alfonso XI of Castile resumed its siege. Juan N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Lara, Juan Manuel, Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, Juan Alfonso de la Cerda, lord of Gibrale\u00f3n all participated in the siege, as did knights from France, England and Germany, and even King Philip III of Navarre, king consort of Navarra, who came accompanied by 100 horsemen and 300 infantry. In March 1344, after several years of siege, Algeciras surrendered.On winning the city, Alfonso XI made it the seat of a new diocese, established by Pope Clement VI's bull Gaudemus et exultamus of 30 April 1344, and entrusted to the governance of the bishop of Cadiz. The bishops of Cadiz continued to hold the title of Aliezira, as it called, until 1851, when in accordance with a concordat between Spain and the Holy See its territory was incorporated into the diocese of Cadiz. No longer a residential bishopric, Aliezira is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.The city was retaken by the Moors in 1368. It was destroyed on the orders of Muhammed V of Granada. The site was subsequently abandoned, but was refounded in 1704 by refugees from Gibraltar following the territory's capture by Anglo-Dutch forces in the War of the Spanish Succession. It was fortified to guard against British raids with installations such as the Fuerte de Isla Verde built to guard key points. the city was rebuilt on its present rectangular plan by Charles III of Spain in 1760. In July 1801, the French and Spanish navies fought the British Royal Navy offshore in the Battle of Algeciras, which ended in a British victory.The city became the scene for settling a major international crisis as it hosted the Algeciras Conference in 1906. The international forum to discuss the future of Morocco which was held in the Casa Consistorial (town hall).  It confirmed the independence of Morocco against threats from Germany, and gave France control of banking and police interests. In July 1942 Italian frogmen set up in a secret base in the Italian tanker Olterra, which was interned in Algeciras, in order to attack shipping in Gibraltar. During the Franco era, Algeciras underwent substantial industrial development, creating many new jobs for the local workers made unemployed when the border between Gibraltar and Spain was sealed by Franco between 1969 and 1982.\n\nIn 1982 there was a failed plan codenamed Operation Algeciras conceived by the Argentinian military to sabotage the British military facilities in Gibraltar during the Falklands War. The Spanish authorities intervened just before the attack, and deported the two Argentine Montoneros and military liaison officer involved.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAlgeciras is principally a transport hub and industrial city.

It is ranked as the 16th busiest port in the world. The city also has a substantial fishing industry and exports a range of agricultural products from the surrounding area, including cereals, tobacco and farm animals.\n\nPort of AlgecirasIn recent years it has become a significant tourist destination, with popular day trips to Tarifa to see bird migrations; to Gibraltar to see the territory's sights and culture; and to the Bay of Gibraltar on whale watching excursions.\nAlgeciras is the southern terminus of two principal north-south Euroroutes, the E05 and E15.

          "Well worth visiting before you go to the Alhambra. Prepare yourself for a climb in thinner mountain air and there can be crowds ther most of the time.",
          "There are great views of the Alhambra and the Sierra Nevada after a hike up narrow lanes. There are probably better views elsewhere but still worth the effort",
          "Really not worth a detour, especially if you have to hike up the steps to get there, which on our visit involved dodging litter and dog poo. Though probably the highest viewpoint in the city, its certainly a long way from being the best. Personally, I\u2019d recommend climbing",
          "Not really worth it, would definitely recommend Mirador San Miguel do Alto for a breathtaking panorama of the entire region or power view points for closer view over Alhambra. This one looks great from other viewpoints though as it has a picturesque church on top of the hill.",
          "I got here on the little tourist bus that goes around the city - the stop is a short walk away. The mirador is not that big, but there are hardly any tourists here, so it's a great place to get some photos from. It's a five minute walk to Mirador de San Nicolas - if you want",
          "This is one of the viewpoints that you should visit, Granada has got something that no other city in the world has got, you just feel the history",
          "From this relatively small viewing area you can see across the plains beyond Granada and less tourist have found this spot.",
          "Ben here in the late afternoon and early morning. Different views depending on the lighting. Not many people first thing in the morning makes it a better time to visit.",
          "We reached this mirador after using the hop on Tour bus. It's a much easier and cheaper way to climb the hill. Best to wear walking shoes as the cobbles are quite slippy",
          "A good walk to this point, but the views are outstanding, also not that busy so you have time to take photo's & take in the views.",
          "You can spend a bit of time here and get some great views of Granada. If you want you can walk down through some narrow streets and see some of the older parts of Granada",
          "The views you get of the Alhambra are spectacular!!! It is an easy bus ride almost to the top and a beautiful walk back down, winding through the narrow streets with lots of shops. We were very happy we went.",
          "Mirador de San Cristobal is a great viewpoint, which gives you a magnificent viewpoint of the city and the Alhambra castle. I can recommend to go here by foot (pls note its hilly terrain) so that you also enjoy the beautiful Albaicin neighbourhood. The best viewpoint in Granada",
          "An interesting view of the Alhambra and the city, but not really worth a visit if you've already been to San Nicolas.",
          "Looking at the map, you might think this is further uphill from Mirador San Nicolas, and so provides a better view of the Alhambra. In fact, some people have posted photos showing such a view, but they are mostly from Mirador San Nicolas. Mirador de San Cristobal has a nice view",
          "This is a beautiful spot to look out over the city of Granada. Make sure to take the time to visit in the morning and at sunset. Highly recommended.",
          "Very nice view to Granada. Maybe best place to see sunset and alambra. Good place for taking fotos not so many tourist.",
          "We started here for a lovely view of Granada. You really can see everything. There were plenty of families and couples here taking photos. It's a great stop for a little breather on your way up the many hills and stairs. If you don't appreciate a good view, you could probably",
          "There are several miradors scattered throughout Granada, and while they don't haave the buzz of the the San Nicolas Mirador, they offer aan opportunity to quietly admire the views of Granada. One such is San Cristobal. The walk here will take you through some intersting streets",
          "It was a bit of a walk, but we were rewarded with beautiful, panoramic views of Granada. We were on a large bus, but you can take a taxi or lots of minivans available. Musicians entertained for just a tip.",
          "Super views of surroundings - accessible via taxi or mini-bus (off-on tours). Some nice restaurants in the area as well. We also had the chance to watch some \"street flamenco\" and listen to some good local music.",
          "It's a hike to the top of Albayzin neighbourhood where the Mirador de San Cristobal sits and while the view towards the city of Granada is decent the view up to the Alhambra is partially blocked by rooftops. If you want the Alhambra view, best to go to the terrace at the",
          "You can walk up to here from the city in 15 minutes if you are fit enough. If not take a bus or Taxi as views are worth it.",
          "my husband and i were there and were super happy to see granada from the top, suddenly a music band appears and suprise another couple sitting next to us for marriage proposal , with the beauty of this place and beaury of the marriage proposal we started crying, this place ia",
          "Nice stroll to get here through narrow quaint streets of Albayzin district. Great views of the whole city - perfect for taking pictures!",
          "Beautiful views, though not comparable to San Nicholas lookout. Still, if you are wandering around Albayzin, it is quite worth to make a detour, time allowing. If you have time for one lookout only - choose San Nicholas.",
          "The taxi dropped us there and this was eventually a good idea. The views are gorgeous From there, we went down hill toward the old city, couple stops for beers and tapas. What a beautiful memorable day",
          "This is probably the 2nd best lookout of Granada to see the Alhambra. Not as popular as Mirador de San Nicol\u00e1s, it's much quieter and you don't have to jostle with other tourists to get a great view of Alhambra. The downside is that this is a bit of a trek from the main tourist",
          "Mirador de San Cristobal is another great viewpoint near St Nicholas. The view has more of the town and the cathedral as well as several nice churches which you don't see from St Nicholas.",
          "Mirador de San Cristobal offers similar views to that of the more famous Mirador de San Nicolas and is about a 10 minute walk away. As it is higher up it offers a better view of the city, but you'll probably get better views of the Alhambra complex from Mirador de San Nicolas as",
          "Walking in Granada, getting lost in Granada, exploring Granada on foot, is by far the best way to enjoy what Granada has to offer ! When you go high, you have the best view possible, and that is what Mirador de san Cristobal offers ! Enjoy it !",
          "This is a great square to go for some great views of the city and some time with locals, but in a quieter area than other parts of the city. I would recommend going here, some of the tours take you here. I liked it - quiet, serene, yet beautiful views by yourself or with another",
          "It is quite something to reach the mirador after wondering around the narrow streets of El Albaicin. Granada is a magic place, but reaching the mirador in the evening is just breathtaking, you can see La Alhambra and the hill on top of Granada. It is one one my very favourite",
          "Best time to visit this place is just before sunset. This is also the best time to make pictures. Don't wait until the sun has set completely (as most of the people do), because then the light has gone and the red shine on the Alhambra as well. It is also a good place for night",
          "But, there are plenty of cobblestone and narrow and steep ascents while admiring the beauty of the area. Yet, lots of cool photo opportunities!",
          "Compared to the Mirador San Nicholas the Mirador San Christobel is a haven of tranquillity! No crowds, no buskers. The walk through the back streets to get to the viewing place takes you through the real Granada. You can look over the city of Granada and the view is wonderful",
          "This viewpoint is a much smaller one as compared to the viewpoint of San Nicolas . Being small there were not so many people and we enjoyed the tranquility with the background music of a man singing and playing guitar at the viewpoint. It is also very near to the viewpoint of",
          "There is not a lot to see here; yes you can see over Granada but you can see neither the Cathedral or the Alhambra. You can see the Basilica of San Juan de Dios and the Monastery of San Jeronimo, but not a lot else. However, this is where you get off the bus for the short walk",
          "We hiked over to Cristobal, and while it was a gorgeous view of the city and not slammed with tourists, the view of the Alhambra is so much better from San Nicolas. Worth the trip, but if your goal is seeing Alhambra, go to the other one!",
          "This viewpoint is a bit out of the way and there's nothing really nearby. The views are pretty good, but there's no benches and it's not exactly designed for lingering around. For that reason there was only about 4 other people there when we were. We got here by walking from",
          "We walked up the hill and found this Mirador. We took some great pictures and felt it was worth the climb",
          "Plan ahead for a sprint up-hill to catch the sunset over this stunning view point. It's absolutely worth it. It's one of those places that feels magical and quintessentially Granada.",
          "There are better places to enjoy the views of Grenada - Mirador de San Nicolas for example. The view is nice, but after climbing many hills in the city I feel like this one is not that special. And the busy road behind you is definitely spoiling the view.",
          "Great views of the Alhambra and city below. Dotted with plenty of restaurants and comes to life at sunset when full of locals and atmosphere.",
          "Its a good place to hike up to at the end of the day and see the sunset. Its about the highest point around town and you are over looking Granada.",
          "Wanted a great place to see a sunset that was private. Too many people at the Nicolas lookout. Much less crowded and just as beautiful here. In fact this is where I proposed to my now fianc\u00e9! Good spot!",
          "A nice little lookout to view the Alhambra at sunrise or sunset. If you have time is is worth a visit.",
          "An other very nice Panorama over the old town of Grenade, the palace and the Alhambra; very spectacular in the morning and in the evening, come, and enjoy this view, and don't forget to savour the nice sunset of Grenade.",
          "Unfortunately we missed it ! we took bus C2 ( Sacromonte-Centro) from Plaza Nueva. There are many stops but the bus doesn't stop at all of them. There is no anoucement of bus stops inside the bus so you don't know where to stop! So, stay close to the driver and ask from the",
          "We came across this viewpoint while rambling through the old quarters. Good views of the wide city but cannot see Alhambra from here. We were back later in the day and the softer light was much more friendly for photography.",
          "Read in a guide book that this was a better viewpoint than San Nicolas but fortunately we spent two nights in Granada and were able to experience both. San Nicolas has a much better view of the Alhambra being closer and unobstructed. San Christobel is a partial view, although if",
          "A nice steep walk up for a great view. Not as touristy and full of souvenir sellers like mirador san Nicolas.",
          "Our AirBnB apartment was right in the plaza with the Mirador (mission) - but the church was never open during our stay. Great views of the city from the plaza; but otherwise, not much to see here.",
          "An excellent view point over Alhambra, city of Granada and the plain with mountains at the horizon. A perfect place for a sunset.",
          "Very small, good view, less crowded of course. You would have a better view by walking into the Albayzin",
          "This is one the few Miradores that you can find on the top before you go down Paseo De los Tristes. I recommend to take a taxi to the top and start your way down. Taxis are very inexpensive here and are worth it unless you are ready for a great workout.",
          "We stumbled upon this as we were wandering around. Nice spot for pictures and to take in the view. If you keep going you will find even better views ! awesome city",
          "This was our 'meeting point' for us to get to our accomodation . Its a small paved area with a decent view but with buses keep stopping and all the traffic passing on a busy road you could not decsribe it as tranquill !",
          "Mirador de San Cristobal offers a slightly different perspective of Granada and its main attraction the Alhambra than its far more popular neighbor the Mirador San Nicolas. At Mirador de San Cristobal you'll meet locals who hang out enjoying the beautiful view.",
          "View of the alhambra is partially blocked. But the sunset view is clear. Was not very crowded on one of a Saturday. It is less famous than San Nicolas",
          "This lookout was never that crowded, but the views are not as good as Mirador de San Nicolas. So have a look anyway as they are close to each other",
          "We went to this lookout on our Segway tour. It has great views over the city without the crowds. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "An alternative to the views from San Nicolas and only walking distance away. Great views of the Alhambra and Granada Cathedral with cactus plants and tiled houses providing great foreground interest.",
          "I have been to both Mirador de San Cristobal and Mirador de San Nicolas and the view from San Cristobal is not nearly as good as from San Nicolas, mainly because your view of the Alhambra is partly obstructed. I did find, however, that the view of the Alhambra gets much better",
          "A tourist must for breathtaking views of Granada, walking along these cobble-stoned pathways affords the visitor a glimpse into Spain's multicultural ethos",
          "We enjoyed the view from the mirador so much we went back almost every day for another quick look. There's usually a guitarist or two serenading the crowd and several restaurants in the vicinity.",
          "This viewpoint is higher than St Nicholas' but the views of the Alhambra are worst. However, you can see the entire city at your feet from here",
          "Excellent spot to get an overall view of Granada including the Alhambra. Can reach by walking as you will discover interesting alley ways as you walk through teh Albaicyn neighborhood. Take map!!!!",
          "DO not miss this if you are into sight seeing Nice place to enjoy the magnificent view of Alhambra Can get to it with the mini busses C1 and C2 from Puerta Nueva",
          "Another mirador withe a beautiful panoramic view of the Alhambra, the Generalize and the Sierra Nevada.",
          "Less well known than San Nicholas but the views are equally if not more stunning. You can see across to Alhambra and also the Sierras snowtopped in the distance. A great view on all sides. Getting there is best by public transport or walking through Albacyzin and using as map as"

          "Pretty nice observation area. Takes a bit of a climb to get to but you get a nice sweeping perspective of the surrounding city that isn\u2019t too elevated. I\u2019d say that it\u2019s a nice spot to catch the sunset. If you want to get a sunset shot that takes in the Alhambra with the mountains and sky tho, check out mirador de San Miguel.",
          "Nice view of nevada granada mountains, just a spot to capture some picture.",

          "Wow! highly recommended. From here you can see the Alhambra from another angle.",

          "Very nice point of view",
          "This is a great view of the Alhambra. All the classic pictures seem like they were taken from here.  It's also a cool plaza just in itself. Maybe just because there are so many people there for the view.  \n\nThis is in the albaicin \u2026",
          "Great point to watch the sunset but not the best to see the Alhambra.",
          "Great views of the Alhambra but not as good and as direct a view as you get from San Nicholas. Still a nice view of the city and surrounding countryside .",
          "This gives a good view of the Alhambra, day or night. There are bars there as well just in case you have walked up from Granada city centre.",

          "Convenient hotel used for group traveling. No AC available until May, only heater even when the room was worm (in April), the only option is to open the window. Picture of paella served for our Trafalgar group",
          "Beautiful view of the Alhambra. Definitely worth visiting. Also nice to see the local streets on the way up.",

          "Beautiful,  breathtaking sunset.",
          "A beautiful view from the top of Albaicin. An easy climb to reach along cobbled roads, delivering you a gorgeous view of the greater Granada area. It has an incomplete view of the Alhambra but an impressive view of the lower and more modern \u2026",
          "Great views of the Alhambra from here. Not too crowded. Nearby flamenco house.",
          "Beautiful tour of the area. It was nice to see La La alhambra with a view of the Sierra Nevada still with fresh snow behind it.",
          "Wonderful place and wonderful views",
          "There are better views at Alcazaba / Alhambra",
          "Walked all the way up from the city for the view. But the view of the alhambra isn\u2019t really that great from there. Never try to walk up there with a baby buggy. Take for example the bus C34 from \u201aPlaza Nueva\u2018 or even better from \u201aGran V\u00eda 5 - Catedral\u2018 for \u20ac1.40",

          "Good sight seeing Spot",
          "The view is magnificent!Heard the sunset is the best in the world..",
          "This is the highest view point. The view of the mountains (Sierra) is indeed amazing. However the view of the Alhambra is mediocre with only half of it visible due to badly positioned trees. In conclusion worth it if you are interested in the broader landscape :)",
          "Great spot for some pics of the old city walls during the time of the Moors. \n\nMy historical knowledge of this area is not great but you can almost envisage the fighting that must of happened during the final days of Islam in Spain that finally led to the expulsion of Muslims from all of Spain. \n\nAbsolutely fascinating stuff.",
          "you will see another face of alhambra. Recommend to visit after taking alhambra visit. Very crowded during sunset, but you have to visit during sunset.",

          "Wonderfull",
          "one of the best views of the alhambra, but expect touristy crowds, kitschy souvenir vendors, and potential pickpocketers",
          "Great views of the old city wall and parts of the city. Not at all as good as San Nicol\u00e1s for viewing the Alhambra. Because it is situated right next to a bus stop, it is easy to get to. However, this means large your groups can easily stop here and swarm the entire area.",
          "Charming town, beautiful cobbled paths with a strong sense of Moroccan culture",

          "A must see.\nA little smaller than San Nicolas but a great view of the Alhambra and the city.",
          "As far as I can tell no good sunset views r possible bc of a very large tree. There is an ugly gray wall and you can only see a small piece of Alhambra.  Between the Alhambra and the tree, you can only see a part of the town.  If the tree was significantly smaller, the overlook would be at 3 if not 4 stars",
          "You can see all Cordoba from up there",
          "My favourite spot in Granada, great views",
          "A good place to start your exploration of Albaic\u00edn. Take a bus to here, and then start descending the area. Gorgeous!",
          "One of the best spots in the city to enjoy the vibes of the Albicin and take in the views of the Alhambra. If you are not in the mood to walk up the hill to reach this spot the local bus service runs from Plaza Nueva.",

He is believed to have been killed by Nationalist forces at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. His remains have never been found.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nGarc\u00eda Lorca was born on 5 June 1898, in Fuente Vaqueros, a small town 17 km west of Granada, southern Spain. His father, Federico Garc\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, was a prosperous landowner with a farm in the fertile vega (valley) surrounding Granada and a comfortable villa in the heart of the city. Garc\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez saw his fortunes rise with a boom in the sugar industry. Garc\u00eda Lorca's mother, Vicenta Lorca Romero, was a teacher. After Fuente Vaqueros, the family moved in 1905 to the nearby town of Valderrubio (at the time named Asquerosa). In 1909, when the boy was 11, his family moved to the regional capital of Granada, where there was the equivalent of a high school; their best known residence there is the summer home called the Huerta de San Vicente, on what were then the outskirts of the city of Granada. For the rest of his life, he maintained the importance of living close to the natural world, praising his upbringing in the country. All three of these homes\u2014Fuente Vaqueros, Valderrubio, and Huerta de San Vicente\u2014are today museums.\n\nIn 1915, after graduating from secondary school, Garc\u00eda Lorca attended the University of Granada. During this time his studies included law, literature and composition. Throughout his adolescence he felt a deeper affinity for music than for literature. When he was 11 years old, he began six years of piano lessons with Antonio Segura Mesa, a harmony teacher in the local conservatory and a composer. It was Segura who inspired Federico's dream of developing a career in music. His first artistic inspirations arose from the scores of Claude Debussy, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and Ludwig van Beethoven. Later, with his friendship with composer Manuel de Falla, Spanish folklore became his muse. Garc\u00eda Lorca did not begin a career in writing until Segura died in 1916, and his first prose works such as \"Nocturne,\" \"Ballade,\" and \"Sonata\" drew on musical forms. His milieu of young intellectuals gathered in El Rinconcillo at the Caf\u00e9 Alameda in Granada. During 1916 and 1917, Garc\u00eda Lorca traveled throughout Castile, Le\u00f3n, and Galicia, in northern Spain, with a professor of his university, who also encouraged him to write his first book, Impresiones y paisajes (Impressions and Landscapes \u2013 printed at his father's expense in 1918). Fernando de los Rios persuaded Garc\u00eda Lorca's parents to let him move to the progressive, Oxbridge-inspired Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid in 1919, while nominally attending classes at the University of Madrid.\n\n\n=== As a young writer ===\n\nAt the Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid, Garc\u00eda Lorca befriended Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Salvador Dal\u00ed and many other creative artists who were, or would become, influential across Spain. He was taken under the wing of the poet Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez, becoming close to playwright Eduardo Marquina and Gregorio Mart\u00ednez Sierra, the Director of Madrid's Teatro Eslava.In 1919\u201320, at Sierra's invitation, he wrote and staged his first play, The Butterfly's Evil Spell. It was a verse play dramatising the impossible love between a cockroach and a butterfly, with a supporting cast of other insects; it was laughed off the stage by an unappreciative public after only four performances and influenced Garc\u00eda Lorca's attitude to the theatre-going public for the rest of his career. He would later claim that Mariana Pineda, written in 1927, was, in fact, his first play. During the time at the Residencia de Estudiantes, he pursued degrees in law and philosophy, though he had more interest in writing than study.Garc\u00eda Lorca's first book of poems, Libro de poemas, was published in 1921, collecting work written from 1918 and selected with the help of his brother Francisco (nicknamed Paquito). They concern the themes of religious faith, isolation, and nature that had filled his prose reflections. Early in 1922 at Granada Garc\u00eda Lorca joined the composer Manuel de Falla in order to promote the Concurso de Cante Jondo, a festival dedicated to enhance flamenco performance. The year before Lorca had begun to write his Poema del cante jondo (\"Poem of the Deep Song,\" not published until 1931), so he naturally composed an essay on the art of flamenco, and began to speak publicly in support of the Concurso. At the music festival in June he met the celebrated Manuel Torre, a flamenco cantaor. The next year in Granada he also collaborated with Falla and others on the musical production of a play for children, La ni\u00f1a que riega la albahaca y el pr\u00edncipe pregunt\u00f3n (The Girl that Waters the Basil and the Inquisitive Prince) adapted by Lorca from an Andalusian story. Inspired by the same structural form of sequence as \"Deep Song,\" his collection Suites (1923) was never finished and not published until 1983.Over the next few years, Garc\u00eda Lorca became increasingly involved in Spain's avant-garde. He published a poetry collection called Canciones (Songs), although it did not contain songs in the usual sense. Shortly after, Lorca was invited to exhibit a series of drawings at the Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, from 25 June \u2013 2 July 1927. Lorca's sketches were a blend of popular and avant-garde styles, complementing Canci\u00f3n. Both his poetry and drawings reflected the influence of traditional Andalusian motifs, Cubist syntax, and a preoccupation with sexual identity. Several drawings consisted of superimposed dreamlike faces (or shadows). He later described the double faces as self-portraits, showing \"man's capacity for crying as well as winning,\" inline with his conviction that sorrow and joy were inseparable, just as life and death.Romancero Gitano (Gypsy Ballads, 1928), part of his Cancion series, became his best known book of poetry. It was a highly stylised imitation of the ballads and poems that were still being told throughout the Spanish countryside. Garc\u00eda Lorca describes the work as a \"carved altar piece\" of Andalusia with \"gypsies, horses, archangels, planets, its Jewish and Roman breezes, rivers, crimes, the everyday touch of the smuggler and the celestial note of the naked children of C\u00f3rdoba. A book that hardly expresses visible Andalusia at all, but where the hidden Andalusia trembles.\" In 1928, the book brought him fame across Spain and the Hispanic world, and it was only much later that he gained notability as a playwright. For the rest of his life, the writer would search for the elements of Andaluce culture, trying to find its essence without resorting to the \"picturesque\" or the cliched use of \"local colour.\"His second play, Mariana Pineda, with stage settings by Salvador Dal\u00ed, opened to great acclaim in Barcelona in 1927. In 1926, Garc\u00eda Lorca wrote the play The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife, which would not be shown until the early 1930s. It was a farce about fantasy, based on the relationship between a flirtatious, petulant wife and a hen-pecked shoemaker.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1928, he was passionately involved with Dal\u00ed. Although Dali's friendship with Lorca had a strong element of mutual passion, Dal\u00ed rejected the erotic advances of the poet. With the success of \"Gypsy Ballads,\" came an estrangement from Dal\u00ed and the breakdown of a love affair with sculptor Emilio Aladr\u00e9n Perojo. These brought on an increasing depression, a situation exacerbated by his anguish over his homosexuality. He felt he was trapped between the persona of the successful author, which he was forced to maintain in public, and the tortured, authentic self, which he could acknowledge only in private. He also had the sense that he was being pigeon-holed as a \"gypsy poet.\" He wrote: \"The gypsies are a theme. And nothing more. I could just as well be a poet of sewing needles or hydraulic landscapes. Besides, this gypsyism gives me the appearance of an uncultured, ignorant and primitive poet that you know very well I'm not. I don't want to be typecast.\"Growing estrangement between Garc\u00eda Lorca and his closest friends reached its climax when surrealists Dal\u00ed and Luis Bu\u00f1uel collaborated on their 1929 film Un Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog). Garc\u00eda Lorca interpreted it, perhaps erroneously, as a vicious attack upon himself. At this time Dal\u00ed also met his future wife Gala. Aware of these problems (though not perhaps of their causes), Garc\u00eda Lorca's family arranged for him to make a lengthy visit to the United States in 1929\u201330.\n\nIn June 1929, Garc\u00eda Lorca travelled to the US with Fernando de los Rios on the RMS Olympic, a sister liner to the RMS Titanic. They stayed mostly in New York City, where Rios started a lecture tour and Garc\u00eda Lorca enrolled at Columbia University School of General Studies, funded by his parents. He studied English but, as before, was more absorbed by writing than study. He also spent time in Vermont and later in Havana, Cuba.\nHis collection Poeta en Nueva York (Poet in New York, published posthumously in 1942) explores alienation and isolation through some graphically experimental poetic techniques and was influenced by the Wall Street crash which he personally witnessed. This condemnation of urban capitalist society and materialistic modernity was a sharp departure from his earlier work and label as a folklorist. His play of this time, El p\u00fablico (The Public), was not published until the late 1970s and has never been published in its entirety, the complete manuscript apparently lost. However, the Hispanic Society of America in New York City retains several of his personal letters.\n\n\n=== The Second Republic ===\n\nGarc\u00eda Lorca's return to Spain in 1930 coincided with the fall of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and the establishment of the liberal, leftist Second Spanish Republic. In 1931, Garc\u00eda Lorca was appointed director of a student theatre company, Teatro Universitario La Barraca (The Shack). It was funded by the Second Republic's Ministry of Education, and it was charged with touring Spain's rural areas in order to introduce audiences to classical Spanish theatre free of charge. With a portable stage and little equipment, they sought to bring theatre to people who had never seen any, with Garc\u00eda Lorca directing as well as acting. He commented: \"Outside of Madrid, the theatre, which is in its very essence a part of the life of the people, is almost dead, and the people suffer accordingly, as they would if they had lost their two eyes, or ears, or a sense of taste. We [La Barraca] are going to give it back to them.\" His experiences traveling through impoverished rural Spain and New York (particularly amongst the disenfranchised African-American population), transformed him into a passionate advocate of the theatre of social action. He wrote \"The theatre is a school of weeping and of laughter, a free forum, where men can question norms that are outmoded or mistaken and explain with living example the eternal norms of the human heart.\"While touring with La Barraca, Garc\u00eda Lorca wrote his now best-known plays, the \"Rural Trilogy\" of Blood Wedding, Yerma and The House of Bernarda Alba, which all rebelled against the norms of bourgeois Spanish society. He called for a rediscovery of the roots of European theatre and the questioning of comfortable conventions such as the popular drawing-room comedies of the time. His work challenged the accepted role of women in society and explored taboo issues of homoeroticism and class. Garc\u00eda Lorca wrote little poetry in this last period of his life, declaring in 1936, \"theatre is poetry that rises from the book and becomes human enough to talk and shout, weep and despair.\"\n\nTravelling to Buenos Aires in 1933 to give lectures and direct the Argentine premiere of Blood Wedding, Garc\u00eda Lorca spoke of his distilled theories on artistic creation and performance in the famous lecture Play and Theory of the Duende. This attempted to define a schema of artistic inspiration, arguing that great art depends upon a vivid awareness of death, connection with a nation's soil, and an acknowledgment of the limitations of reason.As well as returning to the classical roots of theatre, Garc\u00eda Lorca also turned to traditional forms in poetry. His last poetic work, Sonetos de amor oscuro (Sonnets of Dark Love, 1936), was long thought to have been inspired by his passion for Rafael Rodr\u00edguez Rapun, secretary of La Barraca. Documents and mementos revealed in 2012 suggest that the actual inspiration was Juan Ram\u00edrez de Lucas, a 19-year-old with whom Lorca hoped to emigrate to Mexico. The love sonnets are inspired by the 16th-century poet San Juan de la Cruz. La Barraca's subsidy was cut in half by the rightist government elected in 1934, and its last performance was given in April 1936.\nLorca spent summers at the Huerta de San Vicente from 1926 to 1936. Here he wrote, totally or in part, some of his major works, among them When Five Years Pass (As\u00ed que pasen cinco a\u00f1os) (1931), Blood Wedding (1932), Yerma (1934) and Div\u00e1n del Tamarit (1931\u20131936). The poet lived in the Huerta de San Vicente in the days just before his arrest and assassination in August 1936.Although Garc\u00eda Lorca's drawings do not often receive attention, he was also a talented artist.\n\n\n== Assassination ==\nPolitical and social tensions had greatly intensified after the murder of prominent monarchist and anti-Popular Front spokesman Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo by Republican Assault Guards (Guardias de asalto). Garc\u00eda Lorca knew that he would be suspect to the rising right-wing for his outspoken socialist views. Granada was so tumultuous that it had not had a mayor for months; no one dared accept the job. When Lorca's brother-in-law, Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez-Montesinos, agreed to accept the position, he was assassinated within a week. On the same day he was shot, 18 August, Lorca was arrested.It is thought that Garc\u00eda Lorca was shot and killed by Nationalist militia on 19 August 1936. The author Ian Gibson in his book The Assassination of Garc\u00eda Lorca alleges that he was shot with three others (Joaqu\u00edn Arcollas Cabezas, Francisco Galad\u00ed Melgar and Di\u00f3scoro Galindo Gonz\u00e1lez) at a place known as the Fuente Grande ('Great Spring') which is on the road between V\u00edznar and Alfacar. Police reports released by radio station Cadena SER in April 2015 conclude that Lorca was executed by fascist forces. The Franco-era report, dated 9 July 1965, describes the writer as a \"socialist\" and \"freemason belonging to the Alhambra lodge,\" who engaged in \"homosexual and abnormal practices.\"Significant controversy exists about the motives and details of Lorca's murder. Personal, non-political motives have been suggested. Garc\u00eda Lorca's biographer, Stainton, states that his killers made remarks about his sexual orientation, suggesting that it played a role in his death. Ian Gibson suggests that Garc\u00eda Lorca's assassination was part of a campaign of mass killings intended to eliminate supporters of the Leftist Popular Front. However, Gibson proposes that rivalry between the right-wing Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) and the fascist Falange was a major factor in Lorca's death. Former CEDA Parliamentary Deputy Ram\u00f3n Ruiz Alonso arrested Garc\u00eda Lorca at the Rosales's home, and was the one responsible for the original denunciation that led to the arrest warrant being issued.\n\nIt has been argued that Garc\u00eda Lorca was apolitical and had many friends in both Republican and Nationalist camps. Gibson disputes this in his 1978 book about the poet's death. He cites, for example, Mundo Obrero's published manifesto, which Lorca later signed, and alleges that Lorca was an active supporter of the Popular Front. Lorca read this manifesto out loud at a banquet in honour of fellow poet Rafael Alberti on 9 February 1936.\nMany anti-communists were sympathetic to Lorca or assisted him. In the days before his arrest he found shelter in the house of the artist and leading Falange member Luis Rosales. Indeed, evidence suggests that Rosales was very nearly shot as well by the Civil Governor Vald\u00e9s for helping Garc\u00eda Lorca. Poet Gabriel Celaya wrote in his memoirs that he once found Garc\u00eda Lorca in the company of Falangist Jos\u00e9 Maria Aizpurua. Celaya further wrote that Lorca dined every Friday with Falangist founder and leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera. On 11 March 1937 an article appeared in the Falangist press denouncing the murder and lionizing Garc\u00eda Lorca; the article opened: \"The finest poet of Imperial Spain has been assassinated.\" Jean-Louis Schonberg also put forward the 'homosexual jealousy' theory. The dossier on the murder, compiled in 1936 at Franco's request and referred to by Gibson and others without having seen it, has yet to surface. The first published account of an attempt to locate Lorca's grave can be found in British traveller and Hispanist Gerald Brenan's book The Face of Spain. Despite early attempts such as Brenan's in 1949, the site remained undiscovered throughout the Franco era.\n\n\n== Search for remains ==\n\nIn 2008, a Spanish judge opened an investigation into Lorca's death. The Garc\u00eda Lorca family dropped objections to the excavation of a potential gravesite near Alfacar, but no human remains were found. The investigation was dropped. A further investigation was begun in 2016, to no avail.In late October 2009, a team of archaeologists and historians from the University of Granada began excavations outside Alfacar. The site was identified three decades previously by a man who claimed to have helped dig Lorca's grave. Lorca was thought to be buried with at least three other men beside a winding mountain road that connects the villages of V\u00edznar and Alfacar.The excavations began at the request of another victim's family. Following a long-standing objection, the Lorca family also gave their permission. In October 2009 Francisco Esp\u00ednola, a spokesman for the Justice Ministry of the Andalusian regional government, said that after years of pressure Garc\u00eda Lorca's body would \"be exhumed in a matter of weeks.\" Lorca's relatives, who had initially opposed an exhumation, said they might provide a DNA sample in order to identify his remains.In late November 2009, after two weeks of excavating the site, organic material believed to be human bones was recovered. The remains were taken to the University of Granada for examination. But in mid-December 2009, doubts were raised as to whether the poet's remains would be found. The dig produced \"not one bone, item of clothing or bullet shell,\" said Bego\u00f1a \u00c1lvarez, justice minister of Andalucia. She added, \"the soil was only 40 cm (16in) deep, making it too shallow for a grave.\" The failed excavation cost \u20ac70,000.In January 2012, a local historian, Miguel Caballero P\u00e9rez, author of  \"The last 13 hours of Garc\u00eda Lorca,\" applied for permission to excavate another area less than half a kilometre from the site, where he believes Lorca's remains are located.Claims in 2016, by Stephen Roberts, an associate professor in Spanish literature at Nottingham University, and others that the poet's body was buried in a well in Alfacar have not been substantiated.\n\n\n== Censorship ==\nFrancisco Franco's Falangist regime placed a general ban on Garc\u00eda Lorca's work, which was not rescinded until 1953. That year, a (censored) Obras completas (Complete Works) was released. Following this, Blood Wedding, Yerma and The House of Bernarda Alba were successfully played on the main Spanish stages. Obras completas did not include his late heavily homoerotic Sonnets of Dark Love, written in November 1935 and shared only with close friends. They were lost until 1983/4 when they were finally published in draft form. (No final manuscripts have ever been found.) It was only after Franco's death that Garc\u00eda Lorca's life and death could be openly discussed in Spain. This was due not only to political censorship, but also to the reluctance of the Garc\u00eda Lorca family to allow publication of unfinished poems and plays prior to the publication of a critical edition of his works.\nSouth African Roman Catholic poet Roy Campbell, who enthusiastically supported the Nationalists both during and after the Civil War, later produced acclaimed translations of Lorca's work. In his poem, The Martyrdom of F. Garcia Lorca, Campbell wrote,\n\n\n== Memorials ==\n\nIn Granada, the city of his birth, the Parque Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca is dedicated to his memory and includes the Huerta de San Vicente, the Lorca family summer home, opened as a museum in 1995. The grounds, including nearly two hectares of land, the two adjoining houses, works of art, and the original furnishings have been preserved. There is a new statue of Lorca on the Avenida de la Constituci\u00f3n in the city center, and a new cultural center bearing his name is currently under construction and will play a major role in preserving and disseminating his works.\nThe Parque Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, in Alfacar, is near Fuente Grande; in 2009 excavations in it failed to locate Lorca's body. Close to the olive tree indicated by some as marking the location of the grave, there is a stone memorial to Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and all other victims of the Civil War, 1936\u201339. Flowers are laid at the memorial every year on the anniversary of his death, and a commemorative event including music and readings of the poet's works is held every year in the park to mark the anniversary. On 17 August 2011, to remember the 75th anniversary of Lorca's assassination and to celebrate his life and legacy, this event included dance, song, poetry and dramatic readings and attracted hundreds of spectators.\nAt the Barranco de Viznar, between Viznar and Alfacar, there is a memorial stone bearing the words \"Lorca eran todos, 18-8-2002\" (\"All were Lorca\"). The Barranco de Viznar is the site of mass graves and has been proposed as another possible location of the poet's remains.\nGarc\u00eda Lorca is honored by a statue prominently located in Madrid's Plaza de Santa Ana. Political philosopher David Crocker reports that \"the statue, at least, is still an emblem of the contested past: each day, the Left puts a red kerchief on the neck of the statue, and someone from the Right comes later to take it off.\"In Paris, France, the memory of Garc\u00eda Lorca is honored on the Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca Garden, in the center of the French capital, on the Seine river.\nThe Fundaci\u00f3n Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, directed by Lorca's niece Laura Garc\u00eda Lorca, sponsors the celebration and dissemination of the writer's work and is currently building the Centro Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca in Madrid. The Lorca family deposited all Federico documents with the foundation, which holds them on their behalf.In the Hotel Castelar in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where Lorca lived for six months in 1933, the room where he lived has been kept as a shrine and contains original writings and drawings of his.\nIn 2014 Lorca was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of unsolved murders\n\n\n== List of major works ==\n\n\n=== Poetry collections ===\nImpresiones y paisajes (Impressions and Landscapes 1918)\nLibro de poemas (Book of Poems 1921)\nPoema del cante jondo (Poem of Deep Song; written in 1921 but not published until 1931)\nSuites (written between 1920 and 1923, published posthumously in 1983)\nCanciones (Songs written between 1921 and 1924, published in 1927)\nRomancero gitano (Gypsy Ballads 1928)\nOdes (written 1928)\nPoeta en Nueva York (written 1930 \u2013 published posthumously in 1940, first translation into English as Poet in New York 1940)\nLlanto por Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00edas (Lament for Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00edas 1935)\nSeis poemas gallegos (Six Galician poems 1935)\nSonetos del amor oscuro (Sonnets of Dark Love 1936, not published until 1983)\nLament for the Death of a Bullfighter and Other Poems (1937)\nPrimeras canciones (First Songs 1936)\nThe Tamarit Divan (poems written 1931\u201334 and not published until after his death in a special edition of  Revista Hisp\u00e1nica Moderna in 1940).\nSelected Poems (1941)\n\n\n=== Select translations ===\nPoem of the Deep Song \u2013 Poema del Cante Jondo, translated by Carlos Bauer (includes original Spanish verses).

        "wiki": "Granada ( gr\u0259-NAH-d\u0259, Spanish: [\u0261\u027ea\u02c8na\u00f0a]) , locally [\u0261\u027ea\u02c8na] is the capital city of the province of Granada, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. Granada is located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the confluence of four rivers, the Darro, the Genil, the Monachil and the Beiro. It sits at an average elevation of 738 m (2,421 ft) above sea level, yet is only one hour by car from the Mediterranean coast, the Costa Tropical. Nearby is the Sierra Nevada Ski Station, where the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 were held.\nIn the 2005 national census, the population of the city of Granada proper was 236,982, and the population of the entire urban area was estimated to be 472,638, ranking as the 13th-largest urban area of Spain. About 3.3% of the population did not hold Spanish citizenship, the largest number of these people (31%; or 1% of the total population) coming from South America. Its nearest airport is Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca Granada-Ja\u00e9n Airport.\nThe Alhambra, an Arab citadel and palace, is located in Granada. It is the most renowned building of the Islamic historical legacy with its many cultural attractions and architectural elements that make Granada a popular destination among the tourist cities of Spain. The Almohad influence on architecture is also preserved in the Granada neighborhood called the Albaic\u00edn with its fine examples of Moorish and Morisco construction.  Granada is also well-known within Spain for the University of Granada which has an estimated 82,000 students spread over five different campuses in the city.  The pomegranate (in Spanish, granada) is the heraldic device of Granada.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Umayyad history ===\n\nThe region surrounding what today is Granada has been populated since at least 5500 BC and experienced Roman and Visigothic influences. The most ancient ruins found in the city belong to an Iberian oppidum called Ilturir, in the region known as Bastetania. This oppidum eventually changed its name to Iliberri, and after the Roman conquest of Iberia, to Municipium Florentinum Iliberitanum.\n\n\n=== Founding and early history ===\n\nThe Umayyad conquest of Hispania, starting in AD 711, brought large parts of the Iberian Peninsula under Moorish control and established al-Andalus. Granada's historical name in the Arabic language was \u063a\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0629 (\u0120arn\u0101\u1e6dah). The word G\u00e1rnata (or Karnatah) possibly means \"hill of strangers\". Because the city was situated on a low plain and, as a result, difficult to protect from attacks, the ruler decided to transfer his residence to the higher situated area of G\u00e1rnata. According to Arabic sources Ilbira (Elvira) was razed during Fitna of al-Andalus, afterwards it was not restored at its previous place and instead Garnata, which was a Jewish ghetto before, replaced it as the main city. In a short time this town was transformed into one of the most important cities of al-Andalus.In the early 11th century, after the collapse of the Umayyad Caliphate, the Berber Zawi ben Ziri established an independent kingdom for himself, the Taifa of Granada. His surviving memoirs \u2013 the only ones for the Spanish \"Middle Ages\" \u2013 provide considerable detail for this brief period. The Zirid Taifa of Granada was a Jewish state in all but name; the Muslim king is looked upon as a mainly symbolic figurehead. It was the center of Jewish Sephardi culture and scholarship.\n\nEarly Arabic writers repeatedly called it \"Garnata al-Yahud\" (Granada of the Jews).... Granada was in the eleventh century the center of Sephardic civilization at its peak, and from 1027 until 1066 Granada was a powerful Jewish state. Jews did not hold the foreigner (dhimmi) status typical of Islamic rule. Samuel ibn Nagrilla, recognized by Sephardic Jews everywhere as the quasi-political ha-Nagid ('The Prince'), was king in all but name. As vizier he made policy and\u2014much more unusual\u2014led the army.... It is said that Samuel's strengthening and fortification of Granada was what permitted it, later, to survive as the last Islamic state in the Iberian peninsula.\nAll of the greatest figures of eleventh-century Hispano-Jewish culture are associated with Granada. Moses Ibn Ezra was from Granada; on his invitation Judah ha-Levi spent several years there as his guest. Ibn Gabirol\u2019s patrons and hosts were the Jewish viziers of Granada, Samuel ha-Nagid and his son Joseph.\nWhen Joseph took over after his father's death, he proved to lack his father's diplomacy, bringing on the 1066 Granada massacre, which ended the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain.\nBy the end of the 11th century, the city had spread across the Darro to reach the hill of the future Alhambra, and included the Albaic\u00edn neighborhood (now a World Heritage site). The Almoravids ruled Granada from 1090 and the Almohad dynasty from 1166.\n\n\n=== Nasrid dynasty\u2014Emirate of Granada ===\n\nIn 1228, with the departure of the Almohad prince Idris al-Ma'mun, who left Iberia to take the Almohad leadership, the ambitious Ibn al-Ahmar established the last and longest reigning Muslim dynasty in the Iberian peninsula, the Nasrids. With the Reconquista in full swing after the conquest of C\u00f3rdoba in 1236, the Nasrids aligned themselves with Fernando III of Castile, officially becoming the Emirate of Granada in 1238. Most historians agree that Granada became a tributary state to the Kingdom of Castile from that year, although this was often interrupted by wars between the two states. It provided connections with Muslim and Arab trade centers, particularly for gold from sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb, and exported silk and dried fruits produced in the area. The Nasrids also supplied troops from the Emirate and mercenaries from North Africa for service to Castile.\nIbn Battuta, a famous traveller and an authentic historian, visited the Kingdom of Granada in 1350. He described it as a powerful and self-sufficient kingdom in its own right, although frequently embroiled in skirmishes with the Kingdom of Castile. In his journal, Ibn Battuta called Granada the \"metropolis of Andalusia and the bride of its cities.\"During the Moor rule, Granada was a city with adherents to many religions and ethnicities (Arabs, Berbers, Christians and Jews) who lived in separate quarters. During this Nasrid period there were 137 Muslim mosques in the Medina (city) of Granada.\n\n\n=== Reconquista and the 16th century ===\n\nOn January 2, 1492, the last Muslim ruler in Iberia, Emir Muhammad XII of Granada, known as \"Boabdil\" to the Spanish, surrendered complete control of the Emirate of Granada to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, Los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos (\"the Catholic Monarchs\"), after the last battle of the Granada War.\nThe 1492 surrender of the Kingdom of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs is one of the most significant events in Granada's history as it marks the completion of the Reconquista. The terms of the surrender, expressed in the Alhambra Decree treaty, explicitly allowed the city's Muslim inhabitants, known as Mud\u00e9jars, to continue unmolested in the practice of their faith and customs. By 1499, however, Cardinal Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros grew frustrated with the slow pace of the efforts of the first archbishop of Granada, Hernando de Talavera, to convert non-Christians to Christianity and undertook a program of forced Christian baptisms, creating the Converso (convert) class for Muslims and Jews. Cisneros's new tactics, which were a direct violation of the terms of the treaty, provoked the Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1499\u20131501) centered in the rural Alpujarras region southwest of the city.\nResponding to the rebellion of 1501, the Castilian Crown rescinded the Alhambra Decree treaty, and mandated that Granada's Muslims convert or emigrate. Under the 1492 Alhambra Decree, Spain's Jewish population, unlike the Muslims, had already been forced to convert under threat of expulsion or even execution, becoming Marranos (meaning \"pigs\" in Spanish), or Catholics of Jewish descent. Many of the elite Muslim class subsequently emigrated to North Africa. The majority of the Granada's Mud\u00e9jar Muslims converted so that they could stay, however, becoming Moriscos, or Catholics of Moorish descent (\"Moor\" being equivalent to Muslim). Both populations of conversos were subject to persecution, execution, or exile, and each had cells that practiced their original religion in secrecy.\nOver the course of the 16th century, Granada took on an ever more Catholic and Castilian character, as immigrants came to the city from other parts of the Iberian Peninsula. The city's mosques were converted to Christian churches or completely destroyed. New structures, such as the cathedral and the Chanciller\u00eda, or Royal Court of Appeals, transformed the urban landscape. After the 1492 Alhambra decree, which resulted in the majority of Granada's Jewish population being expelled, the Jewish quarter (ghetto) was demolished to make way for new Catholic and Castilian institutions and uses.\n\n\n==== Legacy ====\n\nThe fall of Granada has a significant place among the important events that mark the latter half of the Spanish 15th century. It completed the so-called \"Reconquista\" (or Christian reconquest) of the almost 800-year-long Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula. Spain, now without any major internal territorial conflict, embarked on a great phase of exploration and colonization around the globe. In the same year, the sailing expedition of Christopher Columbus resulted in what is usually claimed to be the first European sighting of the New World, although Leif Erikson is often regarded as the first European to land in the New World, 500 years before Christopher Columbus. The resources of the Americas enriched the crown and the country, allowing Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand to consolidate their rule as Catholic Monarchs of the united kingdoms. Subsequent conquests, and the Spanish colonization of the Americas by the maritime expeditions they commissioned, created the vast Spanish Empire: for a time, the largest in the world.\n\n\n== Heritage and monuments ==\nThe greatest artistic wealth of Granada is its Spanish-Islamic art \u2013 in particular, the compound of the Alhambra and the Generalife. The Generalife is a pleasure palace with attached romantic gardens, remarkable both for its location and layout, as well as for the diversity of its flowers, plants and fountains. The Alhambra is the architectural culmination of the works of Nasrid art that were undertaken in the 13th and 14th centuries, with most of the Alhambra having been built at the time of Yusuf I and Mohammed V, between 1333 and 1354.\nAt present, the buildings of Granada are typically bourgeois in appearance, with much of the architecture dating from the 19th Century, together with numerous Renaissance and Baroque buildings.\n\n\n=== Alhambra ===\n\nThe Alhambra is a Nasrid \"palace city\". It was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1984. It is certainly Granada's most emblematic monument and one of the most visited in Spain. It consists of a defensive zone, the Alcazaba, together with others of a residential and formal state character, the Nasrid Palaces and, lastly, the palace, gardens and orchards of the Generalife.\nThe Alhambra occupies a small plateau on the southeastern border of the city in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada above the Assabica valley. Some of the buildings may have existed before the arrival of the Moors. The Alhambra as a whole is completely walled, bordered to the north by the valley of the Darro, to the south by the al-Sabika, and to the east of the Cuesta del Rey Chico, which in turn is separated from the Albaic\u00edn and Generalife, located in the Cerro del Sol.\nIn the 11th century the Castle of the Alhambra was developed as a walled town which became a military stronghold that dominated the whole city. But it was in the 13th century, with the arrival of the first monarch of the Nasrid dynasty, Muhammad I of Granada (Mohammed I, 1238\u20131273), that the royal residence was established in the Alhambra. This marked the beginning of its heyday. The Alhambra became palace, citadel and fortress, and was the residence of the Nasrid sultans and their senior officials, including servants of the court and elite soldiers (13th\u201314th centuries).\nIn 1492 the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabela, expelled the final Moors from the city of Granada. They established permanent residency in the Alhambra, and it was here that Christopher Columbus requested royal endorsement for his westward expedition that year.\nIn 1527 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor demolished part of the architectural complex to build the Palace which bears his name. Although the Catholic Monarchs had already altered some rooms of the Alhambra after the conquest of the city in 1492, Charles V wanted to construct a permanent residence befitting an emperor. Around 1537 he ordered the construction of the Peinador de la Reina, or Queen's dressing room, where his wife Isabel lived, over the Tower of Abu l-Hayyay.\n\nThere was a pause in the ongoing maintenance of the Alhambra from the 18th century for almost a hundred years, and during control by the First French Empire, substantial portions of the fortress were blown apart. The repair, restoration and conservation that continues to this day did not begin until the 19th century. The complex currently includes the Museum of the Alhambra, with objects mainly from the site of the monument itself and the Museum of Fine Arts.\n\n\n=== Generalife ===\n\nThe Generalife is a garden area attached to the Alhambra which became a place of recreation and rest for the Granadan Muslim kings when they wanted to flee the tedium of official life in the Palace. It occupies the slopes of the hill Cerro del Sol above the ravines of the Genil and the Darro and is visible from vantage points throughout the city. It was conceived as a rural village, consisting of landscaping, gardens and architecture. The palace and gardens were built during the reign of Muhammed III (1302\u20131309) and redecorated shortly after by Abu l-Walid Isma'il (1313\u20131324). It is of the Islamic Nasrid style, and is today one of the biggest attractions in the city of Granada. The Generalife was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984.\nIt is difficult to know the original appearance of the Generalife, as it has been subject to modifications and reconstructions throughout the Christian period which disfigured many of its former aspects. All buildings of the Generalife are of solid construction, and the overall decor is austere and simple. There is little variety to the Alhambra's decorative plaster, but the aesthetic is tasteful and extremely delicate. In the last third of the 20th century, a part of the garden was destroyed to build an auditorium.\n\n\n=== Cathedral ===\n\nThe cathedral of Granada is built over the Nasrid Great Mosque of Granada, in the centre of the city. Its construction began during the Spanish Renaissance in the early 16th century, shortly after the conquest of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs, who commissioned the works to Juan Gil de Honta\u00f1\u00f3n and Enrique Egas. Numerous grand buildings were built in the reign of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, so that the cathedral is contemporary to the Christian palace of the Alhambra, the University and the Real Chanciller\u00eda (Supreme Court).\nThe church was conceived on the model of the Cathedral of Toledo, for what initially was a Gothic architectural project, as was customary in Spain in the early decades of the 16th century. However, Egas was relieved by the Catholic hierarchy in 1529, and the continuation of the work was assigned to Diego Siloe, who built upon the example of his predecessor, but changed the approach towards a fully Renaissance aesthetic.The architect drew new Renaissance lines for the whole building over the gothic foundations, with an ambulatory and five naves instead of the usual three. Over time, the bishopric continued to commission new architectural projects of importance, such as the redesign of the main fa\u00e7ade, undertaken in 1664 by Alonso Cano (1601\u20131667) to introduce Baroque elements. In 1706 Francisco de Hurtado Izquierdo and later his collaborator Jos\u00e9 Bada built the current tabernacle of the cathedral.\nHighlights of the church's components include the main chapel, where may be found the praying statues of the Catholic Monarchs, which consists of a series of Corinthian columns with the entablature resting on their capitals, and the vault over all. The spaces of the walls between the columns are perforated by a series of windows. The design of the tabernacle of 1706 preserves the classic proportions of the church, with its multiple columns crossing the forms of Diego de Silo\u00e9.\n\n\n=== Royal Chapel ===\n\nThe Catholic Monarchs chose the city of Granada as their burial site by a royal decree dated September 13, 1504. The Royal Chapel of Granada, built over the former terrace of the Great Mosque, ranks with other important Granadan buildings such as the Lonja and the Catedral e Iglesia del Sagrario. In it are buried the Catholic Monarchs, their daughter Joanna of Castile (Juana la Loca) and her husband Felipe I (Felipe el Hermoso). Construction of the Chapel started in 1505, directed by its designer, Enrique Egas. Built in several stages, the continuing evolution of its design joined Gothic construction and decoration with Renaissance ideals, as seen in the tombs and the 17th and 18th century Granadan art in the Chapel of Santa Cruz. Over the years the church acquired a treasury of works of art, liturgical objects and relics.\nThe Royal Chapel was declared a Historic Artistic Monument on May 19, 1884, taking consideration of BIC (Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural) status in the current legislation of Spanish Historical Heritage (Law 16/1985 of 25 June). The most important parts of the chapel are its main retable, grid and vault. In the Sacristy-Museum is the legacy of the Catholic Monarchs. Its art gallery is highlighted by works of the Flemish, Italian and Spanish schools.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Albayz\u00edn ===\n\nThe Albayz\u00edn (or Albaic\u00edn) is a neighborhood of Al-Andalus origin, much visited by tourists who flock to the city because of its historical associations, architecture, and landscape.\nThe archeological findings in the area show that it has been inhabited since ancient times. It became more relevant with the arrival of the Zirid dynasty, in 1013, when it was surrounded by defensive walls. It is one of the ancient centres of Granada, like the Alhambra, the Realejo and the Arrabal de Bib-Rambla, in the flat part of the city. Its current extension runs from the walls of the Alcazaba to the cerro of San Miguel and on the other hand, from the Puerta de Guadix to the Alcazaba.\nThis neighborhood had its greatest development in the Nasrid era, and therefore largely maintains the urban fabric of this period, with narrow streets arranged in an intricate network that extends from the upper area, called San Nicol\u00e1s, to the river Darro and Calle Elvira, located in the Plaza Nueva. The traditional type of housing is the carmen granadino, consisting of a free-standing house surrounded by a high wall that separates it from the street and includes a small orchard or garden.\nIn the Muslim era the Albayz\u00edn was characterized as the locus of many revolts against the caliphate. At that time it was the residence of craftsmen, industrialists and aristocrats. With the Christian reconquest, it would progressively lose its splendor. The Christians built churches and settled there the Real Chanciller\u00eda. During the rule of Felipe II of Spain, after the rebellion and subsequent expulsion of the Moors, the district was depopulated. In 1994 it was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site. Of its architectural wealth among others include the Ziri walls of the Alcazaba Cadima, the Nasrid walls, the towers of the Alcazaba, the churches of Salvador (former main mosque), San Crist\u00f3bal, San Miguel Alto and the Real Chanciller\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Sacromonte ===\n\nThe Sacromonte neighbourhood is located on the Valpara\u00edso hill, one of several hills that make up Granada. This neighborhood is known as the old neighbourhood of the Romani, who settled in Granada after the conquest of the city. It is one of the most picturesque neighborhoods, full of whitewashed caves cut into the rock and used as residences. The sound of strumming guitars may still be heard there in the performance of flamenco cantes and quej\u00edos, so that over time it has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in Granada.\nAt the top of this hill is the Abbey of Sacromonte and the College of Sacromonte, founded in the 17th century by the then Archbishop of Granada Pedro de Castro. The Abbey of Sacromonte was built to monitor and guard the alleged relics of the evangelists of Baetica. Those are of questionable authenticity, but since their finding the area has been a religious pilgrimage destination.The abbey complex consists of the catacombs, the abbey (17th\u201318th centuries), the Colegio Viejo de San Dionisio Areopagita (17th century) and the Colegio Nuevo (19th century). The interior of the church is simple and small but has numerous excellent works of art, which accentuate the size and rich carving of the Crucificado de Risue\u00f1o, an object of devotion for the Romani people, who sing and dance in the procession of Holy Week. The facilities also include a museum, which houses the works acquired by the Foundation.\n\n\n=== Charterhouse ===\n\nThe Charterhouse of Granada is a monastery of cloistered monks, located in what was a farm or Muslim almunia called Aynadamar (\"fountain of tears\") that had an abundance of water and fruit trees. The initiative to build the monastery in that place was begun by Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, known as El Gran Capit\u00e1n. The charterhouse was founded in 1506; construction started ten years later, and continued for the following 300 years.\nThe Monastery suffered heavy damage during the Peninsular War and lost considerable property in 1837 as a result of the confiscations of Mendiz\u00e1bal. Currently, the monastery belongs to the Carthusians, reporting directly to the Archdiocese of Granada.The street entrance to the complex is an ornate arch of Plateresque style. Through it one reaches a large courtyard, at the end which is a wide staircase leading to the entrance of the church. The church, of early 16th century style and plan, has three entrances, one for the faithful and the other two for monks and clergy. Its plan has a single nave divided into four sections, highlighting the retables of Juan S\u00e1nchez Cot\u00e1n and the chancel's glass doors, adorned with mother-of-pearl, silver, rare woods and ivory. The presbytery is covered by elliptical vaulting. The main altar, between the chancel arch and the church tabernacle, is gilded wood.\nThe church's tabernacle and sancta sanctorum are considered a masterpiece of Baroque Spanish art in its blend of architecture, painting and sculpture. The dome that covers this area is decorated with frescoes by the C\u00f3rdoba artist Antonio Palomino (18th century) representing the triumph of the Church Militant, faith, and religious life.\nThe courtyard, with galleries of arches on Doric order columns opening on it, is centered by a fountain. The Chapter House of Legos is the oldest building of the monastery (1517). It is rectangular and covered with groin vaulting.Mosque of Granada\nThe Mosque of Granada was inaugurated in 2003 on the summit of the neighborhood of Albayzin. The mosque was built near the Church of San Salvador and the Church of San Nicol\u00e1s. The Church of San Salvador was built on the site of the Great Mosque of Albayzin. The Society for the Return of Islam in Spain purchased the site in 1981, but it took many years for the plans to be approved. The mosque's initial funding was supplied by Shaykh 'Abdalqadir as-Sufi al-Murabit who envisioned providing Granada's new Spanish Muslim community with a mosque. Additional funding came from Malaysia, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. In 1991 the CIE (Comunidad Isl\u00e1mica en Espa\u00f1a) hired the architect Renato Ramirez Sanchez to design the mosque. In the 1990s, there was a heated debate pertaining to the design of the minaret. Construction eventually began in 2001. The mosque now serves about 500 people.\n\n\n=== Palace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar ===\nThe Palace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar was built in one of the most emblematic streets of Granada, the Carrera del Darro, at number 5. This place is an architectural example of the classical Granada during the Renaissance transformation of the XVIth century. It was built by the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar, great-grandson of both Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez del Pulgar (known by the name of El de la Haza\u00f1as [The One of the Valiant Deeds]) and Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (El Gran Capit\u00e1n [The Great Captain]), Captain-General of the Castilian-Aragonese forces that concluded the Reconquest of the peninsula. The palace is now the museum of perfumes El Patio de los Perfumes, with 1,500 square metres (16,000 sq ft) of floor space on two floors and 130 square metres (1,400 sq ft) of patio to relax surrounded by flowers and perfumes.\n\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nMonasterio de San Jer\u00f3nimo: monastery\nSan Juan de Dios Hospital\nCastril Palace\nMuseo de Bellas Artes de Granada\nMadrasah of Granada\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area of Granada ===\nGranada's metropolitan area consists of about fifty municipalities and the capital. Although it is not formally constituted as a political and administrative body, there are several public services that are combined. The arrival of many inhabitants of the capital and other towns in the province, influences a large Population growth. Despite the fact that the capital loses inhabitants, who move to neighboring towns. The main causes of the exodus towards the towns of the metropolitan area are, mainly, the difficulty of accessing a home in the capital because of the high prices it has and labor reasons, because in the towns of the periphery the majority are being located of industrial estates.\n\n\n=== Capital of Granada Province ===\nThe city of Granada is the capital of the province of the same name, thus all administrative entities of provincial scope dependent on the regional government and the state are located there. There is a provincial delegation from each of the governmental departments to the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, coordinated by a government delegate under the Ministry of the Interior. The national government of Spain has a sub-delegation in Granada, subordinate to the government delegate in the autonomous community.\n\n\n=== Judicial administration ===\nThe headquarters of the Superior Court of Justice of Andalusia, Ceuta and Melilla is in Granada, located in Plaza Nueva, in the building of the historic Royal Chancery, as well as the Superior Prosecutor's Office of Andalusia, located in the building of the Bank of Spain. It has a Provincial Court, located in Corteza del Carmen Street, and is also head of the Judicial Party No. 3 of the province, whose demarcation includes the city and 49 towns, some of them very populated, in the metropolitan area region.\nMost of the courts are located in two administrative buildings, in Plaza Nueva and Avenida del Sur. The set of judicial bodies is as follows: \n\nSuperior Court of Justice: President. Civil-Criminal Chamber. Contentious-Administrative Room. Social room.\nProvincial Court: President. Criminal: 2; Civil: 3\nCourts\n\n\n=== Municipal organization ===\nIts political administration is carried out through a City Council, of democratic management, whose components are chosen every four years by universal suffrage. The electoral roll is composed of all residents registered in Granada over 18 years of age, of Spanish nationality and of the other member countries of the European Union. According to the provisions of the General Electoral Regime Law, which establishes the number of eligible councilors according to the population of the municipality, the Municipal Corporation of Granada is made up of 27 councilors. In the municipal elections held in 2019 the constitution of the City Council was eleven councilors belonging to the Popular Party, eight to the Socialist Party, four belonging to Citizens Party, three to Vamos, Granada and one to the United Left-Socialist Alternative-For the People. After these results with the rise of the new political forces, PP and PSOE lost power; and after negotiations an agreement was reached with which Jos\u00e9 Torres Hurtado, mayor of the Popular Party, continues as mayor, under the supervision of the regeneration compliance required by the Citizens party. After his resignation, due to his involvement in Operation Serrallo / Nazar\u00ed, the socialist Francisco Cuenca was appointed mayor.\n\n\n=== Municipal districts and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Granada consists of eight districts whose population is distributed in the attached chart according to the 2009 census of the City of Granada. These districts formed a set of 36 neighborhoods. All boundaries of districts and neighborhoods were modified in February 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal service areas ===\nThe municipal government team has organized the distribution of management responsibilities, structuring itself in the following service areas: Weddings and Palaces, Equal opportunities, Economy, Education, Communication office, Unified license management, Youth, Environment, Municipal Office of Consumer Information, Citizen Participation, Group of Civil Protection Volunteers, Local Police.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n\n=== Realejo ===\nRealejo was the Jewish district in the time of the Nasrid Granada. (The centuries since the Jewish population were so important that Granada was known in Al-Andalus under the name of \"Granada of the Jews\", Arabic: \u063a\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648\u062f\u200e Gharn\u0101\u1e6dah al-Yah\u016bd.) It is today a district made up of many Granadinian villas, with gardens opening onto the streets, called Los C\u00e1rmenes.\n\n\n=== Cartuja ===\nThis district contains the Carthusian monastery of the same name: Cartuja. This is an old monastery started in a late Gothic style with Baroque exuberant interior decorations. In this district also, many buildings were created with the extension of the University of Granada.\n\n\n=== Bib-Rambla ===\nThe toponym derives from a gate (Bab al-Ramla, or the Gate of the Ears) that was built when Granada was controlled by the Nasrid dynasty. Nowadays, Bib-Rambla is a high point for gastronomy, especially in its terraces of restaurants, open on beautiful days. The Arab bazaar (Alcaicer\u00eda) is made up of several narrow streets, which start from this place and continue as far as the cathedral\n\n\n=== Sacromonte ===\n\nThe Sacromonte neighborhood is located on the extension of the hill of Albaic\u00edn, along the Darro River. This area, which became famous by the nineteenth century for its predominantly Gitano inhabitants, is characterized by cave houses, which are dug into the hillside. The area has a reputation as a major center of flamenco song and dance, including the Zambra Gitana, an Andalusian dance originating in the Middle East. The zone is a protected cultural environment under the auspices of the Centro de Interpretaci\u00f3n del Sacromonte, a cultural center dedicated to the preservation of Gitano cultural forms.\n\n\n=== Zaid\u00edn ===\n\nThis formerly blue collar but now upmarket neighborhood houses 100,000 residents of Granada, making it the largest neighborhood or 'barrio'. Traditionally populated by Romani people, now many residents are from North and West Africa, China, and many South American countries. Every Saturday morning it hosts a large outdoor market or \"mercadillo\", where many people come and sell their wares of fruits and vegetables, clothes and shoes, and other odds and ends.\n\n\n== Gastronomy ==\nThe gastronomy of Granada is part of the Arabic-Andalusian cuisine tradition, with a strong Arab and Jewish heritage, which is reflected in its condiments and spices, such as cumin, coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon, raisins, almonds or honey. The writer Miguel Alcobendas, author of the traditional cuisine of Granada, says that it has its origin in living together, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century (when Granada surrendered to the Catholic Kings), of Muslims, Jews and Christians in the Nasrid Kingdom from Granada. Subsequently there was a miscegenation with the kitchen of the Christians, in which the pork acquired an importance in the kitchen of Granada more than in the rest of Spain, since its consumption allowed its eaters to demonstrate a certain distance from the persecuted religions, since both Muslims and Jews have it banned.\nThe climatic differences of the different regions of the province, from the coast to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada propitiates a great variety of raw materials: vegetables], meats and sausages, fish that are combined in a multitude of dishes and recipes for soups and stews.\nThe famous and reputed Trev\u00e9lez ham comes from the Sierra of Granada, to which other pork derivatives are added, sausages such as chorizo, black pudding and pork tenderloin.\nHam and beans, two products of the land, are combined in one of its most typical dishes, beans with ham; Other known dishes are the Sacromonte tortilla, which among other ingredients must have cooked brains and veal crustaillas, chopped and sauted before mixing with the egg. It is also worth mentioning \"papas a lo pobre\", potatoes which are usually served with egg and fried peppers, as well as with pieces of pork or ham.\nAmong the stews and potajes, the pot of San Ant\u00f3n stands out, which is eaten mainly towards the second half of January; cabbage stew, which combines vegetables and legumes; the stew of green beans and fennel; The thistle and pumpkin casserole, with noodles and aromatic herbs, or gypsy pottery are other dishes of the land. \nConfectionery is well represented in the gastronomy of Granada, for sweets prepared by the nuns can be purchased in the numerous convents of the city: the pesti\u00f1os of V\u00e9lez or those of the Encarnaci\u00f3n, the puff pastries of San Jer\u00f3nimo, the moles of San Ant\u00f3n eggs, the Zafra biscuit, sweet potato rolls, cocas, roscos from Santo Tomas and mantecados. Aljoj\u00e1banas, honey and cheese dumplings and some of the fritters called almohados, as well as fig bread, Moorish roscos and an almond cake called soy\u00e1 are all of Arabic heritage. \nUnlike in other provinces of Andalusia, in Granada tapas (appetizers or snacks) are usually free in bars and restaurants. \"Bar hopping\" (Ir de tapas) and eating tapas in the time between finishing work and having dinner is a deeply rooted traditional activity among the people of Granada. There are different tapas routes around the city.\n\n\n== Leisure and entertainment ==\nIn Granada there is a wide program of leisure and entertainment, which covers a large number of fields, available to both visitors and citizens themselves. Of the leisure activities carried out, the following can be highlighted: \n\nThe zambras of Sacromonte. Old bridal parties held by the gypsies of the city, and that disappeared for years before their current vindication. They develop in the caves of the Sacromonte neighborhood and have a unique character in the world of flamenco. There are also more classic flamenco shows in the Albaic\u00edn. These flamenco shows, usually linked to restaurants, are one of the city's cultural attractions.\nFestivals. Granada has a very complete range of events: International Music and Dance Festival, International Jazz Festival, Granada Festival South Cinemas and International Tango Festival, among others.\nConcerts.

        "wiki": "The Royal Monastery of St. Jerome (Spanish: Real Monasterio de San Jer\u00f3nimo de Granada) is a Roman Catholic Hieronymite monastery in Granada, Spain. Architecturally, it is in the Renaissance style. The church, famous for its architecture, was the first in the world consecrated to the Immaculate Conception of Mary.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe monastery was founded by the Catholic Monarchs Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon in Santa Fe outside the city of Granada, during the siege of the latter city, the last stage of the Reconquista. The construction of the current buildings in Granada properly began in 1504, and the monastery relocated at that time. The principal architect and sculptor was Diego de Silo\u00e9; others involved as architects or sculptors included Jacopo Torni (from Florence), Juan de Arag\u00f3n, Juan Bautista V\u00e1zquez the Younger (V\u00e1zquez el Mozo), Pedro de Orea, and Pablo de Rojas, the last three associated with the Granadan school of sculpture.\nThe Hieronymites are an Augustinian order. The monastery church follows the usual plan for churches of this order, a Latin Cross with an elevated choir at the foot and the altar behind a wide staircase. The mannerist altarpiece of the main chapel is considered the point of departure of Andalusian sculpture as such; it is mainly the work of Pablo de Rojas. The richly decorated Renaissance interior features coffering, scalloping and sculptures, and is a late work of Renaissance humanism. The iconographic program highlights the military and the heroic grandeur of the Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, known as the Gran Capit\u00e1n (\"Great Captain\"), who is buried in the crossing with his wife, Do\u00f1a Maria de Manrique.\nAs of 1513, the church was under construction under the leadership of Jacopo Torni 1513. Upon his death in 1526, the task devolved to Diego de Silo\u00e9. The main chapel was completed in 1522 and the bodies of the Great Captain and his wife were moved from the Casa Grande of the Convent of Saint Francis.\nAlthough occupied again today by the same order of monks as at the time of its founding, the monastery has undergone many vicissitudes, including invasion by the French in the Napoleonic era during the Peninsular War. The Hieronymites were expelled and the monastery eventually became a near-ruin. The State undertook a restoration of the building in 1916\u20131920, hiring the architect Fernando Wihelmi for the job. The slender tower of the church had been demolished by the French, who used its stones to build the bridge known as the Puente Verde, which crosses the River Genil, linking the Paseo de la Bomba to the Avenida de Cervantes. Only in the 1980s was the tower re-erected; the project was completed in 1989.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe monastery has two cloisters, each built around a garden. The older of the two has more genuinely Renaissance decoration: seven arcosolia in the style of chapels, richly adorned in classical style, configure a funerary space that was originally intended to receive the Great Captain's remains into the monastery. The second cloister, now the enclosure of the monastery's community of monks, was the residence of the Empress Isabella of Portugal on her wedding voyage after her marriage to Charles I of Spain (Holy Roman Emperor Charles V).\nThe gateway that separates the grounds of the monastery from the Calle Rector L\u00f3pez Argueta is, indeed, original to the monastery, but had disappeared in the 19th century and was only returned to its position in the 1960s after being found abandoned in a courtyard of in the Vega de Granada. The sculpture of the Virgin of Sorrows on the gate is not original.\nFrom the beginning of 2004 until March 2005, the main altarpiece underwent restoration work under the aegis of the Ministry of Culture; during this time, the altarpiece was covered by a giant blow-up photo of itself.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSan Juan de Dios Hospital (Granada)\nHistory of early modern period domes",

          "Beautiful church! Didn\u2019t realize how grand it would be inside until we were in. Abby was nice but the church definitely a highlight.",
          "From the outside and the cloisters within, you would think this monastery was only plain, simple, and very earthly. Touring around the garden and the cloisters gives you a sense of simple monastic life. But then you enter the church and it is like being transported to another",
          "We visited on New Year's Eve and the monestary was not crowded and very peaceful. The church was magnificent with beautiful painted walls, a stunning celling and altar.",
          "I found the Monastry on Google Maps and the 360\u00b0 photo image on the site made thus a must place to visit. The colours in the photos is quite breathtaking. Slightly fadded when you stand inside the church but still amazing. To the right of the altar is a box which for a 50 cents",
          "This is a Renaissance monastery which is serene and peaceful, with stunning clusters and an exceptionally beautiful church. The gold altar is truly amazing and there are some interesting rooms adorned with a varied selection of paintings. There is also a quaint orange grove",
          "This a very beautiful often overlooked monastery. It is not far from the Cathedral. It is historically significant in that it is the burial place of Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoba (El Gran Capitan). He was one of Spain's greatest military strategist. He negotiated the",
          "amazing place built up over many hundreds of years. Tour slightly spoiled by the guide whose English so often wasn't distinguishable from Spanish",
          "When we first went into the Monastery I was quite disappointed; the refectory is frankly not very interesting. Its only when you get to the church do you get a glimpse of how impressive and lavish it is. The church is literal one vast canvas with virtually every area",
          "I hope they're using the entry fees to renovate as so many parts were in need of attention. The gold alter was very beautiful but the rest had a lot to be desired. Very disappointed, would not recommend.",
          "The complexe is not of huge interest but the church is impressive. There are cloisters and chapels to peek in but that\u2019s about it.",
          "We stumbled across the Saint Jerome Monastery while we were out walking one day. It's an absolute hidden gem and definitely worth seeking out. The interior of the monastery is out of this world, and the cloisters are truly stunning.",
          "Off the beaten track, the highlight of this peaceful monastery is the stunningly beautiful church. Well worth 4 Euros.",
          "Not absolutely a must, this monastery has a few interesting rooms with noticeable paintings, and a lovely church which makes the 4 euros fee worth. There is also a nice patio with orange trees. Worth visiting if you have spare 30 minutes in the city.",
          "If you are in doubt if entering or not, don't think too much: buy the ticket and go in. We were not sure, but after the visit - specially to the last, main room - we understood that we took the right choice. Don't miss it, together with the Cathedral!",
          "Our first of many Monasteries on my list to visit and I would say this was pleasant enough place but not sure it is worth \u20ac10 per adult. The lady at desk was very passive aggressive and started to cancel my machine transaction after I had enquired which option I should selected",
          "Lovely monastery to visit if you have enough days in Granada. It does not require a lot of time, but I believe it's worth the visit.",
          "Not only is this Monastery beautiful from the outside, but you will be surprised by it's complex beautiful, size and types of architecture that is inside of this massive structure. Truly one of the most amazing Monasteries I have seen anywhere else. Tucked a little off of the",
          "We\u2019ve seen a lot of great cathedrals, churches, museums and other sites but this is one of the best we have encountered on our trip. The monastery is out of the way and has very few visitors. Too bad for them! Come here and you will not be disappointed. We purchased the green",
          "A peaceful and spiritual place with a Church that is breathtaking in beauty and spirituality. The golden altar, the frescoes and the sense of timeless faith and devotion moved me to tears. It is a must visit for anyone of any faith or without faith. The most beautiful church in",
          "This monastery is a little out of the tourist area but well worth a visit. When we walked through the first area we thought there wasn't much to see but we were so wrong. An absolutely fascinating place and a very good guide book which was well worth the 1 euro.",
          "From the outside, this monastery is not much, and I happened to pass by during the Holy Cross feast, when the outside gardens were crowded with people celebrating. I decided to visit, and it was an unexpected pleasure. From the ticket office, you go to the nice internal",
          "We found the monastery purely by chance, it wasn't on our itinerary. Arriving at 13.00 we only had half an hour as the monastery closes at 13.30. Cost of entry 4 euros and well worth the cost. A number of the rooms are quite basic as one would expect a monastery to be but",
          "If you have seen the main cathedral and the tomb of Ferdinand and Isabella this monastery should be next on your list. At one of the nominated stops on the road train circuit of Granada, so easy to get to. Closes at 5pm so don't go late. Small cafe and toilet facilities in the",
          "This monastery is lovely and the rooms are interesting to any historian. Nevertheless, the self-guided tour (we had the English version) was very hard to follow in sequence which was a little frustrating.",
          "On entering, the centre of the cloister is planted with orange trees. We were disappointed that the first 2 rooms were closed. On reaching the second wing, the refectory was furnished with a few tables and seating and had an interesting little font where the monks washed their",
          "Saint Jerome monastery in Granada, Spain is an almost hidden gem. There are so many things to see in Granada that you might decide to pass this up. Don't! The sanctuary alone is worth the visit. The architecture, the sculptures, the paintings are all impressive. I particularly",
          "There are so many churches, monasteries and nunneries in Granada that, in advance, it might be difficult to decide which to head for. But St Jerome is one that should be near the top of your list. It is huge, open to the public and centrally located within the old town of",
          "it was not crowded and a very calm place to view around and relax. the monastery has a overwhelming architecture. definetly worth a visit!",
          "Not easy to find the entrance but once inside you find a peaceful cloister with simple furnishings and religious art. All very pleasant but a major surprise once you enter the chapel which is substantially larger than one would expect and has some of the most beautiful",
          "We happened upon this and were charmed by the monastery and its lifestyle. It doesn't take long to walk through, and it offers some beautiful architecture. All of it is intact.",
          "Enjoyed the visit once we found it - it is not well signposted. The entry is not obvious either and then we enjoyed visiting the various rooms around the courtyard. Then WOW we found the chapel ! what a surprise and how beautiful it was. don't miss it",
          "This was a reasonably pretty and peaceful place. There is a limited amount of information and examples of everyday life. However the real highlight was the chapel, near the end of our visit, which is truly beautiful and where it is worth spending some time to really appreciate",
          "Really not worth visiting except for church, that while it is in a state of some degeneration still is interesting. Bypass this one unless you have time to kill.",
          "This monastery is worth the visit, it is quiet and peaceful, and a the church is a masterpiece of art.",
          "I spent five days in Granada and had no plans to visit this place, after scheduling everything I wanted to see burned up most of my travel days. As it turned out, had some extra time and was able to visit this church, not really expecting anything other than another visit to an",
          "We had heard that this was a beautiful little place, well worth a visit - and we weren't disappointed. Eur 4 to enter. The ground floor is open to visitors - it seems like the rest of the monastery is still in use by a religious order. There's a lovely orchard in the middle of",
          "We decided to visit this monastery on a whim and were so glad that we did. It was peaceful, beautiful and interesting! Pretty little orchards of orange trees, bells chiming from the towers and literal choir singing somewhere in the background. The chapel is very surprising",
          "How incredible is the altar of this church. We spent almost an hour there just watching it. Than we had to leave because of closure time at 13.30 h. Make sure to remember that most churches close between 13h & 17h.",
          "To be quite honest, we stumbled into this monastery because it was included in our Granada card and we needed to rest our sore feet. Thank God, literally! The overall monastery is a living one and suitably spartan, but the church which come around the end of the small tour, is",
          "It is very impressive. It is big and richly adorned. The rest of the building is quite plain with a lot of paintings. A quick look around these part is sufficient.",
          "Beautiful structure with incredible architecture. We took our time and walked around the entire place. Make sure NOT to miss the church part that is towards the end. Amazing house of prayer and worship worth every penny to enter",
          "This is another jewel in crown of Granada. It has all the classic features of a monastery with ecclestiacal art on every turn. Right in the heart of the old city near the Cathedral it is well worth the hour spent to see its wonders. For those who live locally or are self",
          "Incredible craftsmanship involved in this church, a real wow factor when you walk into the main area. Well worth a visit as there is lots to see, great displays of old religious artifacts",
          "Not particularly advertised but what a great find. Well worth a morning to see. The church at the end of the visit is superb and not expected",
          "Well worth a visit to this tranquil monastery. Captures the peaceful lifestyle of the inhabitants and the church is beautiful.",
          "Our neighbours raved about this church, so we decided to pay it a visit when we visited Granada. And we weren't disappointed. It may not look particularly special from the outside, but it's jaw-droppingly magnificent inside (more so than the cathedral, we thought). Incredibly",
          "This monastery is a bit away from the city centre. It thus does not have the usual tourist crowd. The courtyard is very serene. Unfortunately we did not have time to enter.",
          "We visited the gardens of this beautiful monastery & were truly enchanted by the beautiful gardens & tranquility of the place. Although in the city you feel a million miles away from the bustle of the city streets. Unfortunately we were unable to go inside but even just seeing",
          "Not grand from outside, but once inside it is a different story altogether. There is a entry fee of about 3 euros, but it is worth it. Don't miss.",
          "A must-see for all die-hard church lovers. Old architecture for those who enjoy the taste of history.",
          "You know how you sometimes walk in a door and catch your breath? Then you step farther in and can hardly believe your eyes? This church is that kind of \u201cWOW!\u201d After the Alhambra and the Royal Chapel and Cathedral, this place can be ranked as an equal or, I would not hesitate to",
          "This is a can't miss among the many gorgeous cathedrals and churches in Granada. It was the first one of the many that we toured, and I think it had some of the most interesting details, especially with the painted ceilings and classic patio/courtyard with orange trees.",
          "Not open continuously so take care, but once in there the monastery church is a gem! Amazing place to just look at all these details. Worth the detour!",
          "A friend recommended we visit here and we were so glad we did. Wander through the rooms around the cloisters surrounding the orchard of orange and lemon trees and finish in the church to view the magnificent altarpiece - my husband nearly missed it! We bought marmalade made by",
          "Beautiful monastery. Beautiful cloisters. Peaceful place. I wish it was not such a gray and misty day. I can imagine it would look this much more magnificent in a brighter day.",
          "This attraction should be higher up the list, as it truly is a magnificent building. From the attractive facade and pretty courtyard with orange trees, to the ornate majestic altar and sacristy. You will see it listed as Monasterio de San Jer\u00f3nimo. Well worth making a trip to",
          "The monastery may be a little off the beaten track, but it well worth the effort to find. I saw quite a few churches in Spain, but this was far and away the best, with that magnificent altarpiece.",
          "The inside of the church is magnificent. One could stay here for hours just looking at all the details of the altarpiece. I have been in hundreds of churches and this one has to be one of the most splendid I have seen. Do not miss this. Be aware that it closes between 1:30 and",
          "My favourite city centre religious building. When you enter the monastery cloisters go round anticlockwise therby saving the best till last. The gardens in the centre of the cloisters house an orchard of orange and lemon trees. Having gone all the way round you will come to the",
          "Check the opening times, its closed in the afternoon from 13.00 until 16.00. Worth the 4 euros admission as the interior is simply stunning. It should not be confused with the Basilica de San Juan de Dios nearby. Many of the photos on the Basilica TripAdvisor site are actually",
          "I thought this was just going to be another ornate religious building but how wrong could i be! From the beautiful open central courtyard each doorway leads to awe inspiring sights. Topping it all was the main church and side rooms ornately carved from marble it was so grand",
          "The Monasterio de San Jer\u00f3nimo is a monastery previously occupied by Hieronymite monks of the St. Augustine order. The monks don't seem to occupy the monastery in the present day. Which might have something to do with fact that they were expelled during the French occupation.",
          "Very quiet place for tourist. We were the only two there when we visited. The place is a bit run down but the church inside is well worth the price we paid.",
          "If you've already been to the Cathedral and Capilla Real, you may feel that you've had your fill of Spanish Baroque. But this is unique - an overwhelming level of decorative detail crammed onto every available surface and corner.",
          "Situated just away from the main tourist area we were so glad we visited St Jerome Monastery. Quiet and peaceful with some lovely areas of interest off of the main courtyard. The 1 euro guide sheet was very informative and well laid out. Very ornate church. Definitely worth",
          "\u20ac4 to enter the monastery proper & walk around; \u20ac1 for a written guide (available in several languages). The main chapel is spectacular.",
          "You can walk around the outer courtyard with no charge but it is well worth the \u20ac4 entry fee (kids are free) to get into the monastery proper. The internal structure contains a garden of orange trees but the main building is most impressive. Ornately decorated throughout and",
          "Amazing place, do not go to many churches etc on holiday but glad my daughter convinced me to go. Some good places to eat around there as well.",
          "Lovely Monastery. Open from 10am to 1:30pm then again from 4pm. Worth a visit. Closed on Monday as with most museums in Spain.",
          "Saw the courtyard of the monastery as we passed by on the tourist bus. We walked back to find it and so pleased we did. It was beautiful inside, very quiet and cool with amazing carvings and art work. The ceiling was amazing ! Also in very quaint part of Granada",
          "Took in the visit as all \u201c\u201dAlhambra\u2019s out\u201d. Definitely worth a visit as only a few minutes further from the Cathedral. 4\u20ac entry and no Queues. Paper guides available in various languages for 1\u20ac. Lovely cloisters beautiful inside in the church, very ornate - could also hear the",
          "Our guide at the Alhambra Palace strongly recommended we visit this place and we are glad we did although we only had time for a brief visit. There were several interesting and varied rooms off the main cloister which had a courtyard full of olive trees but the highlight was",
          "I didn't get in, but my hotel was very close and I used to walk from there every morning, I loved it and used to stop and take some photos there.",
          "Great monastery. Well worth a visit. Fantastic church - amazing detailed decor. A small entrance fee of about 4 euros. Very serene.",
          "Just happened on this Monastery and I am amazed by the quantity and quality of the art. It would literally take hours to look at every sculpture that adorns this altar The realization that people were buried on these grounds for centuries puts your life in perspective.",
          "When you enter the place a peacefull silence already surrounds you. Walking through the corridors outside with the small orange trees you enter an amazing work of art.",
          "It is worth going to this monastery to see an impressive altar richly decorated, it is also worth noting the side aisles and coping.",
          "St. Jerome Monastery is certainly worth a visit if you re in Granada. The exterior is rather plain and uninteresting but it belies all of the visual treasures that one finds inside the monastery.",
          "Not wanting to reveal the surprise just telling you, you must go and visit this monastery, most probably it will take you sometime to understand why but be patient.",
          "We went here on a combined ticket that we bought near the cathedral, which covered the cathedral, the capilla real and whatever combination you want of 3 other sites. It's a little way out of the centre but not a long walk, and near to the Basilica of San Juan de Dios which is",
          "The street-facing wall belies the grand interior of the church. When one first enters the pretty cloister, one cannot imagine the grandeur that will await in the church. Today the place house nuns, which have their own cloistered section (not accessible to the public).",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this monastery. Not hugely special, but several interesting bits to see and not too far from centre of town.",
          "This attraction is well worth the walk. The artwork is very different to the Cathedral and looks to some extent like a huge tattoo canvass. We get cathedral weary after a while but this place was a little different. It also lacked the big crowds and only cost 4 euros to go in.",
          "We went to this monument because it was included in the Granada Card and it is a hidden gem. The place is very peaceful and quite, and the church is stunning.",
          "Wonderful cloisters with many austere rooms such as refectories from them, finally leading to the large and impressive church.",
          "Beautifully decorated but lacks the wow feeling you get in the Basilica of St John one block beside this place. Better than the cathedral at least. After (or before) looking in the church, take a walk around the cloister and take a look into to rooms around here. Guide on paper",
          "Lovely gothic monastery and church in traditional Spanish style. They also sell condiments and biscuits from the present occupants who are nuns.",
          "We visited here as it was included as part of the Granada card otherwise we might not have bothered. Nice gardens and architecture and interesting as it goes.",
          "Sure, Alhambra deserves admiration but not the attitude of bar and restaurant owners towards tourists. No drink prices are displayed, and it seems you are charged according to your face. We had a couple of beer and when I asked the price list to check the bill, I was answered in",
          "Monasterio de San Jeronimo was included on our Monastery Tour with granadapicnictours. It was a peaceful place when we visited on a fairly warm day. Cool inside the stone walled courtyard. We enjoyed it but it didn't impress like the Cartuja.",
          "We went around early in morning very quiet and peaceful. Written guide very good and lots of time to take in atmosphere or sit in sunshine cakes delicious",
          "This place is definitely a hidden gem of Granada! It has some beautiful architecture; lovely as the cathedral is, I love the white marble of the vestry here even more than that. A must see!",
          "Although included in the Granada card, this monastery was empty and quiet during weekend. The large empty rooms where kind of depressing. It has plenty of old catholic art just hanging around. No explanations or guide where supplied.",
          "We went to Saint Jerome initially looking to find Orange Blossom as they have a wonderful courtyard of Orange and Lemon trees in a sheltered location. No Blossom BUT enter the monastery Turn Right and visit each chapel as you go anticlockwise around the quadrangle. The very last",
          "It was our last day and we decided to visit this monastery as it was on our Granada card. We made our way past the cathedral and found the road which took us to the monastery. Through the door we went and headed into the cloisters. What an absolute delight. The orange and lemon",
          "After a few days of none stop cathedrals in various cities, this quaint monastery was a nice change. The colorful wall paintings were beautiful and refreshing as compare to the dazzling gold in a cathedral.",
          "Very beautiful church, not too busy so no need to rush, easy to get good photos without jostling with too many other people. \u20ac4 per person, lots to see off courtyard, not over friendly staff, no toilets.....",
          "Lovely quiet cloister in the centre filled with orange and lemon trees. Most of the rooms off this are rather cold and dark but the main room makes a trip worth it. Not a surface is left undecorated and the far end is covered is gold icons from floor to ceiling. Only 4 euros",
          "we visited this Monastery because it's included in our Granada Card. Interesting place. look at the tiles ;-)",
          "a small walk from our hotel, 4 euros entry fee is well worth it and 1 euro for a programme which was in different languages was breathtaking",
          "You don't need a lot of time here but don't miss it. Lovely building and chapel and inside cloister.",
          "After visiting Alhambra and all the main sights around the city centre i had some spare hours and decided to visit this place. It was a great surprise! I was there at 10am and it was completely empty. The church has amazing ceiling and decoration. If you have time, it is well",
          "Overall impression on a visit here is that this is place where men of a religious order lived and prayed. As such it has soul. When you walk along the wide cloisters of the building open to the courtyard, look down and you will see names and dates of former monks - some in the",
          "Well worth the admission of four euros. Beautiful place and surroundings and a lovely peaceful way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "Not much to see other than the church inside the monastery, keep in mind that is an active monastery, it is ok to visit if you have extra time.",
          "While not as large nor impressive as the Basilica, the St. Jerome Monastery is still interesting and worth the visit. Also, there are no crowds and a lower admission fee.",
          "Should definitely be on your \"must see while in Granada\" list. Stunningly beautiful and we found the audio guides to be very helpful during our visit and exploration.",
          "Buy the guide of 1 Euro and follow it through the historic rooms. the cloisters where monks were buried, and into the surprisingly beautiful and ornate chapel. Photos are permitted which is a big plus. The exterior of the building is also very striking.",
          "Checked another monastery to see if I was missing anything. Not really. Didn't see any nuns, let alone any nuns selling anything. Admission now 4 euros but free with Granada card. It's a monastery with lots of ornate paintings and an altar. Very peaceful but not compelling",
          "The San Jeronimo Convent is a beautiful monastery/convent with a big patio. The main sight here is the large retable in hte chapel that is quite beautiful and impressive.",
          "My wife and I always like to visit San Jeronimo when we go to Granada because it has a very beautiful retable. On the right side of the retable, you can put a 50 cent coin to light up the retable and this will allow you to take better photos of the retable.",
          "Beautiful monastery but to get the sense of the place it needs silence which unfortunately is not the case with the number of visitors who think that bellowing is fine. They should enforce an atmosphere of silence otherwise the spirit of the place is lost.",
          "Beautiful monestary that demonstrates the architecture and art of Spain's golden era when riches started to flow from the new world and the monestary enjoyed royal patronage. Not sure why it is called a monestary and not a conventional since nuns still run the place. Tip: there",
          "If you are travelling around Portugal and stopping in to visit many churches and cathedrals then this one does not need to be on your list of must sees. However, on its own it is worth a look and if you go right when it opens at 10 am there were very few visitors and you can",
          "An effective restoration of a disused monastery which delivers a flavour if what life must have been like for those in holy orders.",
          "This is a working monastery with not a whole lot to look at for 4 euros. The cloister is ok, the church is pretty, but not overwhelming. I was done in less than 10 minutes. Don't bother.",
          "Do not miss this totally amazing monastery. We were told about it by friends and we were completely blown away by its superb interior. If you are visiting Granada, it is a must see.",
          "Catholic religious art is mostly hideous, grotesque or both. The church at the monastery of San Jeronimo has the most complete collection of poorly executed art I've ever seen. The niches chapels walls and ceilings are coated and encrusted with ugly representations of the",
          "While walking the town on and off the bus/train which is perfect to see all in Granada, found this site. We spoke to someone coming out and after touring around the Convento see why it was recommended. If you like churches this is very good.",
          "Small but lovely monastery in the center of Granada. Chambers are simple and quiet, very nice patio with orange trees and a church with really spectacular paintings inside as well as not so typical and really beautiful vault and altar. Must see point on Granada map.",
          "This is not on most \"must see\" lists for Granada but is well worth a visit. Its a short walk from the old city - located in the university district of the the new city - and its on the hop-on/hop-off bus route. Originally a monastery it was heavily damaged by military",
          "Quiet. Impressive. Breathtaking church interior. Peaceful. Historic. Contemplative. Truly a hidden gem which is not yet discovered by the many tourists in Granada.",
          "A place to visit especialy if you ride a bike. You should go at the afternoon so that you can go down after visiting the place and discover Alhamabra from another side. Granada is a very nice city full of surprises",
          "Rivals the Alhambra for Christian beauty. 4\u20ac charge to get in, beautiful courtyard and citrus trees, tons of Christian art, hidden away from the noise of the city",
          "I had read about the Saint Jerome Monastery and the stunning chapel so set off in search..armed with my map and no Spanish...I made my way to be pretty close and with the help of locals I found it. When you approach the actual entrance you wondered if you are in the right place.",
          "We did hike up to the convent Charthouse, but found that everything we needed and enjoyed was right her at Covento de San Jeronimo. The chapel and alter are amazing and the rooms are clean and well restored. They really do close in the afternoon, so be sure of the hours when",
          "The receptionist at our hotel recommended that we visit the monastery and boy are we glad we did. It's a treat. And a very surprising one at that.",
          "A very impressive church within the monastery of San Jeronimo now a convent. Well worth a visit whilst in Granada.",
          "The Monastery of Saint Jerome is unlike anything I have seen. The building from the outside and even at the entrance foyer does not provide an indication of the beauty inside. The monastery is painted top to bottom inside and sculpture seen in other monuments are replaced with",
          "Visiting a monastery doesn't usually feature highly on a list of must sees but if you have several days in Granada make sure it's on your list. Entrance fee is a modest 3.5 Euros and you can easily spend a couple of hours soaking up the peace of the cloisters or the wonders of",
          "Even if I was astonished by moorish art and architecture, and that was my preferred attraction in Granada, I appreciated this convent a lot. There is a calm atmosphere that brings you back in the Barroco epoca, with nuns walking in distance, almost unseen if you are not paying",
          "Personally I found this monastery to be absolutely stunning inside. Don't be put off by the very bland looking outside - the main chapel etc are amazing. Every single part of it is so detailed, even all the walls are painted! Definitely worth a visit for some good pictures",
          "We visited the monastery and were completely taken aback but the main worship area. A hiddem gem that was well-worth the visit",
          "My husband and I entered here because admission was free with our Granada card so we just wanted to have a look. Seeing the chapel was a wonderful surprise. It is gorgeous and definetely worth a visit. Normally entrance is \u20ac5.",
          "5\u20ac entrance fee gets you access into the beautiful old quadrangle. Its a very quiet, serence place with an orange tree garden and multiple old halls to explore and take in the artwork and ancient architecture. The highlight however was the church at the end of the walk. Honestly",
          "A masterpiece of baroque art and a must if you like monasteries/churches (along with La Cartuja and the Cathedral). It is very close to the center and you can just go walking and also have lunch in a nice area",
          "This is a little of the beaten track but don't go to Granada and not pay a visit. The interior is stunning and because of its location you will avoid the crowds around the normal tourist hot spots. You could spend ages admiring the fresco's which adorn the walls.",
          "You have to have some interest in church architecture and art history but if you do then this church will fascinate you. One of the most decorated churches I have seen in Spain and probably rivals the cathedral in Zaragoza for ornamentation if not scale. The altarpiece and roof",
          "The monastery (now used as a convent), offers interesting insight into the history of the area and the austerity of the life lived here, even within an impressive architectural space. The church is astounding - Baroque in style and, like most, filled with amazing art. A nice way",
          "This historic monastery has absolutely breathtaking artwork. The rooms appear just the way they must have been in the 12th century. And the history of the place, having been restored by nuns, who still are a presence there, is fascinating.",
          "This is my favourite place in Granada. I'm not a religious person and I got moved by the beauty of this church.",
          "Layout organized to save highlights for last. The chapels around the cloister/courtyard are galleries with art. Of special interest are the series depicting Carthusian monks martyred in England during the Reformation. But the true highlight is the sanctuary and chapels off",
          "Beautiful cloisters and ornate church. Well written pamphlet giving lots of information about the style and history of the buildings and rooms. This is a working convent which feels lived in, not an empty shell. Well worth a visit",
          "El Monasterio de San Jeronimo is a small church/monastery that dates from the 1500s. It's relatively small, and honestly I stumbled upon it by accident. I was very pleasantly surprised, however. From the outside, it appears to be a modest, medieval church, and as you enter",
          "San Jeronimo has a larger church and tower area than most. It is in good condition in a quiet area of Granada",
          "With its fresco covered walls and dramatic altar this is a church which does stand out from the rest. However, it didn't take long to circuit the cloister and the church. Plan to include it with visits to other places.",
          "Really wonderful, it should be visited. It's not promoted enough, but my guide mentioned it as a place to go...and it was right.",
          "One word Beautiful! !!!! A place you must visit .fantastic the old town in granada is also beautiful great bars & taps",
          "Incredible altar and space. We were wandering and a local led us to the site which was definitely worth a visit.",
          "For 4 EUR or free with the Granada card this is must see! The church is just amazing and the monastery with its orange orchard is nice as well.",
          "Almost solitude as we had time and space to walk through the cloisters and hallways to the church with only a handful (maybe 10 others) of interested tourists; the nuns were out of site. There is a detailed guide in English for cross referencing the Renaissance activities of",
          "Go there, get in the mood, stay a bit and plunge into the gorgeous church. You will never forget the experience.",
          "It was down the list, it was out of the way maybe, but it was worth a 100 times. The visit costs a lot less than many others and the place is grandiose.Go there by all means.",
          "definitively a place to visit for its church. The style is different from others churches I've seen in Andalusia ; this impression is probably due to the mix of beautiful wall frescos with richly decorated interiors and gorgeous altarpieces.",
          "The monastery is OK, but does not stand out. What does is the church. It is quite enormous for a monastery church and has a great atmosphere and is quite unique.",
          "Visited based on other reviews, and was deeply shocked. The cloisters around orange and lemon trees were lovely, but on entering the main 'church' to find every wall covered in images of saints, bishops and so called religious works was deeply disturbing. As a place or",
          "We went there on a grey, overcast day.Initially the cold cloisters and stark furniture made us feel in contact with the austerity the Monks must have felt, but on entering the chapel, it was truely awe inspiring. The whole of the ceiling is decorated with images , the alter and",
          "We were advised to visit here by Spanish friends and were very pleased we took their advice. There is a charge of a few euros but it is well worth it. The convent is a calm and spiritual place centred around a green square with cloisters on all sides. It is easy to imagine the",
          "We had a lovely visit to the Monastery using our Granada Cards. A lovely spot filled with Orange Trees and beautiful architecture. Highly recommend spending a half hour stopping by!",
          "This was a lovely place to visit. It is tucked away but well worth seeking out and much better than the Monastery Cartuja. Lovely art works, central courtyard and the main chapel is beautiful.",
          "Having visited the main attractions in Granada we looked for something to kill some time and decided on a walk down to this convent. A 10 mins walk from the middle of town the outside of the convent is fairly standard - fairly reserved exterior. The small ticketing room was",
          "Not many people speak of this place. It looked a sizeable building on the map, and was within walking distance of our hotel, so off we went. It\u00b4s spacious atmosphere and cleanliness was striking, so well restored it could have been the original. The outstanding feature is the",
          "If you have some time, this Monastery is worth a visit. The church is awe-inspiring and certainly worth a few hours to indulge.",
          "An interesting place to visit if you go to Granada. An example of monastic architecture, although a bit neglected. Worth an hour or two.",
          "The elaborate decoration of this monastery is simply stunning! I was amazed by the detailed sculptures and painting. Although, I didn't expect 4 Euros admission fee, it was worth visiting indeed!",
          "It is not an attraction much puclicized but very worth it. The church is very interesting, rich and quiet.A place of peace.",
          "This evidently a place run by Nuns, they sell some sweet biscuits or hard cakes pretty good but sweet. The main part has a wow altar and ceiling which I could see clearly so I took a picture to study later.",
          "Based on the number of reports the Monastery of St. Jerome is not visited by many tourists -this is a shame as it is a truly beautiful church & cloisters. It is only a short walk from the Cathedral and well worth the effort. A wonderful high altar with all the walls of the",
          "A special place in the centre of Granada. A very quiete monastery but with rich art work inside the main chapel.",
          "The church in the saint Jerome monastery knocked our socks off. We saw this at the end of a long day that was mostly spent at the Alhambra. We saw the cathedral as well. And so at this point not much would impress us. But this sure did. Every inch of this church is",
          "Guide William led us into this sacred space knocking gently on the door to be admitted by a gentleman in a suit, presumably an official of the place. We saw none of the nuns, but that is intentional they are an enclosed order. The church was amazing. A double grille separates",
          "A fantastic experience of awe inspiring beauty. Take the time to find the monastery you will not be disappointed. Recommended!",
          "The monastery is a lovely place to spend an hour or two. The adjoining church is also amazing, with a very impressive altar. The entrance fee of 4 euros is reasonable and you can get a helpful guide for another 1 euro. The monastery is a little off the beaten path but worth",
          "I went once and it was closed then nearly didn't go back but was glad I did. It's a little out of the way from all tourist things but it's worth visiting and paying \u20ac4 for. The cloister and orange tree garden is so peaceful but the church is a real stunning surprise and has so",
          "This monastery was one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. It was filled with wonderful artwork and a wonderful place to just sit and escape the heat. From the outside the building does not look anything special, but once inside it was absolutely stunning.",
          "This is a peaceful spot near the University Social Science faculty. It's not ornate, but that's part of its attraction. One caveat is that like most monuments/sites, open in the morning around 10.30, it is closed in the afternoon until 16.30 hrs",
          "This place is simply awe-inspiring. Easy to miss en route, you must visit this seemingly simple, almost commonplace building which hides some of the most amazing art work",
          "Our entrance was included with the City Pass we bought. So that made it worth seeing. Otherwise ... there are much nicer places in the world.",
          "Do not miss this gorgeous example of a Gothic Monastery with Renaissance additions/alterations. The art works inside the main chapel are mesmerising. Cloisters are classic example of their kind, the garden of which is planted with orange trees. This is still operational with",
          "Very peaceful monastery with beautiful orange tree courtyard. Some of grave stones go back to 1643. But the church is breathtaking",
          "Nice and quiet place in the city. The church is impressive and highly decorated. If you are in the neighborhood and feel like spending some time looking around in a small cloister, I recommend going in.",
          "Looks ordinary enough outside, interesting inside and then you get to the church. However jaded or over-churched (this is Granada you cannot scoff being bowled over.",
          "Beautiful place to visit, if you are in Granada. Very peaceful and not very touristy. They charge a small fee, but totally worth it. Recommended!",
          "Alice, my host at Carmen de Toqueros recommended that I visit San Jeronimo and she, like me, is none too keen on Spanish baroque generally. I had seen too much martyrdom and gold leaf in churches in Latin America but decided to give this convent a try. Alice had described it",
          "Worth looking for as this monastery is not well advertised and the entrance could be missed easily. Inside it is serene and quiet, with amazing decoration and courtyards of orange trees to look out on. The actual church within the monastery defies description-so go and enjoy it",
          "This cloister is definitely worth visiting. The various chapels are impressive as are the courtyards. Several of the chapels have beautifully painted ceilings. We found the marble plaques marking the burials of monks dating back to the early 17th century interesting. The day",
          "Don't miss this place, very interesting and printed guide leaflet very informative. We bought our ticket from a little smiling Nun who poked her head through a hatch! Chapel incredible to just sit and gaze at. Other rooms very interesting.",
          "This is very fine example of spanish renaissance and baroque. It was the first monastery built in Granada after the conquest. Church of the monastery is very richly decorated. Main architect was Diego de Silo\u00e9. It has also influence from Florence, the other architect from there,",
          "The monastery is non far from the Cathedral and give you an idea of the great Spanish Baroque. Don't be scared of the rigorous walls and enter! The interiors of the church and the quiet cloister are worth of your time and attention. The entrance fee is a part of Bono Turistico",
          "I suspect too many people visit Granada just for the Alhambra. If so, they miss this beautiful Monestary which is magnificent. It is also a cool retreat from the heat of the day. Well worth a visit. Just drop off from the tour bus stop nearby if you you are not staying in the",
          "Found the entrance to the monastery down a side street beside the hospital. Despite the ornate altarpieces it was strangely sombre. Partly because it's still a working convent, partly because it is so quiet. Very atmospheric.",
          "We couldn't believe this church: a riot of frescoes and paintings and carvings. The surrounding rooms are austere & lovely. We liked how it wasn't overrun w/ tourists.",
          "Try to catch a concert in the elaborate Baroque chapel. and take time to admire the columns which each present one of the archangels.",
          "This closes in siesta time but is worth waiting for. The simplicity of the rooms - other that the chapel - is somehow elegant after all the ornate cathedrals. Part of the building is still a working Monastery so if off limits but a peek through the grill shows that monks do",
          "Beautiful architecture. Found a knowledgeable staff person who could give us a good history, know what you're looking at.",
          "This place holds the beauty of a true monastery. It is incredibly peaceful, and visiting the different rooms you cannot but feel a little lighter. The church is a baroque masterpiece: there is not a single corner that is not decorated and the entire site emanates old",
          "we were astonished by beautiful masterpiece of this monastery. everyone visiting Granada should visit this place.",
          "This place is a must when you go yo Granada. This is a beautiful Convent very well preserved and beaufully built. The visit starts with a walk around the central patio, which is filled with orange trees, then you can visit some of the rooms around it. But the most impressive",
          "Dropped in at Saint Jerome on a late morning as a time-filler before our tour of the Alhambra and we were pleasantly surprised and found our short time there well spent. The self-guided tour is very simple, starting in a pleasant courtyard. Though initially I found the rooms to",
          "When you are in Spain you will see a lot of churches. Or monasteries. You can hardly turn a corner without running into a religious building of some sort. And you get a little fatigued of all the gilt and cherubs and Gothic gloom. Well, this monastery and attached church are",
          "I found this almost hidden monastery absolutely charming and peaceful. It is entered through an extensive, tree lined courtyard, has a charming and not overdecorated chapel and access to the sacristy, refectory and all the other annexes. Beautiful cloisters and no crowds! An",
          "It is a have of tranquility and shade. The church was unexpectedly grand and well worth a visit. There are amazing frescos and gilding.",
          "good but mot very well maintained , I guess they lack funds big tine Great place of history , check up the history on net before going",
          "An absolute must, the chapel is outstanding, ornate and detailed. The other areas are sparse but for the few euros to go in the chapel is amazing - DO NOT MISS IT",
          "Magnificent monastery, so peaceful and ideal to forget the hustle and bustle(and heat!) of Granada for an hour. Many interesting paintings and sculptures and the cloisters are inspiring. Amazing wall behind the altar. Great visit!",
          "Noted for selling almond cakes/cookies but none to be had today....however they offer other trinkets and the like for sale. Gorgeous old building with beautiful gardens in the heart of Granada.",
          "This monastery is inhabited by Nuns not monks! We came upon it by accident as we walked around the town but were so pleased we went in and explored. There are some very interesting chapels but the church is an amazing surprise. It is so high and the decoration takes you by",
          "The church with a beautiful ceiling. The courtyard with its trees and the various rooms around it are very interesting.",
          "i imagined a church within a monastery might be fairly austere but here the opposite is true. We weren't expecting it so it was lovely surprise! No piece of plaster on the columns of the church are without images painted on them - don't recall seeing columns decorated in this",
          "Impresive church and monastery. Renaisance style and marvellous smell in the patio with orange trees. amazing religious scuptures and interesant structure of monastery where you can visit old room like dinnig room.",
          "The Monastery wasn't even recommended in my guidebook but luckily the trip advisor ratings encouraged me to go. The monastery has a beautiful courtyard but the real pull is the incredible alter in the church. Find the light meter to the right of the alter and pay the Euro to",
          "Visited because we purchased a Granada Card in order to get to the Alhambra. But what a great surprise! This active convent contains one of the most astounding churches you will see. Quite a contrast with the austere cloisters and refectory etc. You will see what I mean!",
          "This was a real gem of a building, and clearly not one which is well known. It was a joy to experience the tranquillity of this place, and to admire its beauty.",
          "It is lovely to walk around the courtyard, planted in the center with an orange orchard, and to glance at the beautifully inscribed plaques at your feet dedicated to the friars of many centuries ago who spent their lives here. But the main vaulted altarpiece in this monastery",
          "The San Jeronimo convent is most certainly worth the walk over there, the decorative art inside the convent church is out of this world... enjoyed this place more than the cathedral of Granada, it is exceptional",
          "This is a small place and the nuns do not show themselves as they are in contemplation. You tour at your leisure and it was very quiet on a Sunday morning. The courtyard has many rooms leading off it including the refectory and the church itself. Founded by the Catholic king",
          "I am not sure it is really worth the price paid or reserving to much time/effort for this visit. The main altar hall is really impressive but most of the place is crumbling down and in urgent need of restoration. Few rooms are open for visitation, and not all are interesting.",
          "Monastery founded by \"Catholic Monarchs\" during the siege of Granada. Beautiful cloisters and a wonderful golden wood altar. If you are lucky you can hear the songs of cloistered nuns. The Gran Capit\u00e1n (\"Great Captain\") Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoba, the conqueror of the city, is",
          "Do not miss this extraordinary Monastery still being used by the Augustine nuns. If you go to only one church in Spain, make it this one. This is a hidden gem that completely took my breath away. Sit in a pew and feast your eyes on the artwork, sculptures, columns and the",
          "A friend told us this was the place to visit. It took a lot of looking and we were lost a couple of times, it was so worth it. We arrived late and went in one empty room after another wondering if we were in the wrong place and then we entered the chapel. The decoration was",
          "Not as popular as the main attractions in Granada, but still worth a visit. Despite some renovations at the time of our visit, was a peaceful and serene place to visit. Historically interesting and the change in use over time - from monastery to cavalry barracks to convent!",
          "The monastery is a kind of hidden wonder. Nothing much regarding the cloister, but the church inside the complex is very beautiful. A huge decorated altar and painted walls and columns makes it more interesting than the cathedral. It closes during the Spanish ciesta.",
          "Our guidebook likened the inside of St. Jeronimo's main chapel to \"an explosion in a cherub factory\". It was not exaggerating. The decoration needs to be seen to be believed and takes your breath away.",
          "A lovely way to start or end a visit to Granada. Can be found behind the cathedral, about 1 km away, in the direction of the railway station, where we were headed. You pay around 4 Euros, at the entrance, where, on leaving, you can purchase lovely biscuits made by the remaining",
          "really did not like this place it was totally spooky and dark and suffocating and filled with images of very effeminate dead dying and pathetic emasculated Jesus'. Big ginormous puppet things of St. Esperanza and piles of other stuff ready to be trooped aruong the town in Holy",
          "The Monastery of San Jeronimo was founded by the Catholic Kings in 1492, but was finished in 1565. Diego de Siloe was one of the major architects of this monastery. The cloisters are large and impressive. In the church, the main retable is impressive for its height and beauty.",
          "There are two reasons to go and visit the Jeronimo Convent. In the first place it is a lovely, serene retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. In the second place, the church of the Convent is splendid. The great attraction is the altarpiece, with its detailed sculptures",
          "Amazing place to go, liked this more than the Cathederal. Hard to get your mind round the painted decoration inside the church. Was quiet when we went round and this added to the experience/atmosphere, definately worth the 4 euros.",
          "The monastery is a little bit out of the centre, maybe 700 metres from the cathedral. it is well worth the stroll. First you enter the cloisters/courtyard with its immaculate garden of orange trees. Underneath your feet are stones marking the final resting places of some 500",
          "Plain austerity of monastic life is glimpsed as you stroll around the peaceful cloister with central orange trees. You then enter the church. Extreme contrast. Almost every surface either painted or adorned with statues. Wow!",
          "If you love churches, religious sites, etc. you might like this. For us, paying 4 euro for an uninteresting site was a waste of time and money. There is nothing here that is unique or memorable.",
          "I could see this church from my window of my pension and decided to investigate when I had some free time from visiting with my daughter who is studying in Granada. I paid 4 Euro to get in and wandered around the beautiful court yard with all it's citrus trees and dark rooms.",
          "Fantastic church in amongst the restoration work of the monastery. The dome and alter are as good as the cathederal in Granada.",
          "Off the beaten path, we stumbled across this, and decided to go in. Very interesting and beautiful. Takes about 30 minutes to tour. Worth the time!",
          "The convent itself is small, but well preserved and the chappel its very worth the visit. One of the most beautifull churches I've ever seen.",
          "...in the centre of Granada. We arrived after closing hours (7pm I think) but they were kind enough to let us in for a few minutes.",
          "Convento de San Jeronimo is worth the visit. The convent is very peaceful and beautiful, and the cealing of the church amazing.",

          "A bit bigger than the Cartujo Monastery and more centrally located, if you're short on time, this is the one to see. The entrance fee is four euros and guides cost one euro. You walk around the courtyard and duck into the rooms surrounding it. Most of the rooms are darkly lit in",
          "We went there after visiting la Cartuja: let's say that the change is striking. Everything here is about sobriety, peace and work. The cloister is very nice and the church, impressive: it seems they have put all their resources into this temple! Is definitely worth having a look",
          "For a modest amount of change, you can pick up a pamphlet that guides you from the main door to each of the rooms framing the patio. The information is useful and makes the visit purposeful, while rendering a fun scavenger-hunt sort of sense to things as you're guided to look",

        "wiki": "Andalusia region (UK: , US: ; Spanish: Andaluc\u00eda [andalu\u02c8\u03b8i.a]) is the southern autonomous community in Peninsular Spain. It is the most populous, and the second largest autonomous community in the country. The Andalusian autonomous community is officially recognised as a \"historical nationality\". The territory is divided into eight provinces: Almer\u00eda, C\u00e1diz, C\u00f3rdoba, Granada, Huelva, Ja\u00e9n, M\u00e1laga and Seville. Its capital is the city of Seville. The seat of the High Court of Justice of Andalusia is located in the city of Granada.\nAndalusia is located in the south of the Iberian peninsula, in southwestern Europe, immediately south of the autonomous communities of Extremadura and Castilla-La Mancha; west of the autonomous community of Murcia and the Mediterranean Sea; east of Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean; and north of the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar. Andalusia is the only European region with both Mediterranean and Atlantic coastlines. The small British overseas territory of Gibraltar shares a three-quarter-mile land border with the Andalusian province of C\u00e1diz at the eastern end of the Strait of Gibraltar.\nThe main mountain ranges of Andalusia are the Sierra Morena and the Baetic System, consisting of the Subbaetic and Penibaetic Mountains, separated by the Intrabaetic Basin. In the north, the Sierra Morena separates Andalusia from the plains of Extremadura and Castile\u2013La Mancha on Spain's Meseta Central. To the south the geographic subregion of Upper Andalusia lies mostly within the Baetic System, while Lower Andalusia is in the Baetic Depression of the valley of the Guadalquivir.The name \"Andalusia\" is derived from the Arabic word Al-Andalus (\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633). The toponym al-Andalus is first attested by inscriptions on coins minted in 716 by the new Muslim government of Iberia. These coins, called dinars, were inscribed in both Latin and Arabic. The etymology of the name \"al-Andalus\" has traditionally been derived from the name of the Vandals; however, a number of proposals since the 1980s have challenged this contention. Halm in 1989 derived the name from a Gothic term, *landahlauts,\nand in 2002, Bossong suggested its derivation from a pre-Roman substrate. The region's history and culture have been influenced by the native Iberians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Vandals, Visigoths, Byzantines,\nJews, Romani, Arab Umayyads, and Muslim Moors. During the Islamic Golden Age, Cordoba surpassed Constantinople to be Europe's biggest city, and became the capital of the Al Andalus and a prominent center of education and learning in the world, producing numerous philosophers and scientists. The Castilian and other Christian North Iberian nationalities reconquered and settled the area in the latter phases of the Reconquista.\nAndalusia has historically been an agricultural region, compared to the rest of Spain and the rest of Europe. However, the growth of the community especially in the sectors of industry and services was above average in Spain and higher than many communities in the Eurozone. The region has a rich culture and a strong identity. Many cultural phenomena that are seen internationally as distinctively Spanish are largely or entirely Andalusian in origin. These include flamenco and, to a lesser extent, bullfighting and Hispano-Moorish architectural styles, both of which are also prevalent in some other regions of Spain.\nAndalusia's hinterland is the hottest area of Europe, with cities like C\u00f3rdoba and Seville averaging above 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in summer high temperatures. Late evening temperatures can sometimes stay around 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) until close to midnight and daytime highs of over 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are common. Seville also has the highest average annual temperature in mainland Spain and mainland Europe (19.2 \u00b0C), closely followed by Almer\u00eda (19.1 \u00b0C).\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nIts present form is derived from the Arabic name for Muslim Iberia, \"Al-Andalus\". However, the etymology of the name \"Al-Andalus\" is disputed, and the extent of Iberian territory encompassed by the name has changed over the centuries.The Spanish place name Andaluc\u00eda (immediate source of the English Andalusia) was introduced into the Spanish languages in the 13th century under the form el Andaluc\u00eda. The name was adopted to refer to those territories still under Moorish rule, and generally south of Castilla Nueva and Valencia, and corresponding with the former Roman province hitherto called Baetica in Latin sources. This was a Castilianization of Al-Andalusiya, the adjectival form of the Arabic language al-Andalus, the name given by the Arabs to all of the Iberian territories under Muslim rule from 711 to 1492. The etymology of al-Andalus is itself somewhat debated (see al-Andalus), but in fact it entered the Arabic language before this area came under Muslim rule.\nLike the Arabic term al-Andalus, in historical contexts the Spanish term Andaluc\u00eda or the English term Andalusia do not necessarily refer to the exact territory designated by these terms today. Initially, the term referred exclusively to territories under Muslim control; later, it was applied to some of the last Iberian territories to be regained from the Muslims, though not always to exactly the same ones. In the Estoria de Espa\u00f1a (also known as the Primera Cr\u00f3nica General) of Alfonso X of Castile, written in the second half of the 13th century, the term Andaluc\u00eda is used with three different meanings:\n\nAs a literal translation of the Arabic al-\u00c1ndalus when Arabic texts are quoted.\nTo designate the territories the Christians had regained by that time in the Guadalquivir valley and in the Kingdoms of Granada and Murcia. In a document from 1253, Alfonso X styled himself Rey de Castilla, Le\u00f3n y de toda Andaluc\u00eda (\"King of Castile, Le\u00f3n and all of Andalusia\").\nTo designate the territories the Christians had regained by that time in the Guadalquivir valley until that date (the Kingdoms of Ja\u00e9n, C\u00f3rdoba and Seville \u2013 the Kingdom of Granada was incorporated in 1492). This was the most common significance in the Late Middle Ages and Early modern period.From an administrative point of view, Granada remained separate for many years even after the completion of the Reconquista due, above all, to its emblematic character as the last territory regained, and as the seat of the important Real Chanciller\u00eda de Granada, a court of last resort. Still, the reconquest and repopulation of Granada was accomplished largely by people from the three preexisting Christian kingdoms of Andalusia, and Granada came to be considered a fourth kingdom of Andalusia. The often-used expression \"Four Kingdoms of Andalusia\" dates back in Spanish at least to the mid-18th century.\n\n\n== Symbols ==\n\nThe Andalusian emblem shows the figure of Hercules and two lions between the two pillars of Hercules that tradition situates on either side of the Strait of Gibraltar. An inscription below, superimposed on an image of the flag of Andalusia reads Andaluc\u00eda por s\u00ed, para Espa\u00f1a y la Humanidad (\"Andalusia for herself, Spain and Humanity\"). Over the two columns is a semicircular arch in the colours of the flag of Andalusia, with the Latin words Dominator Hercules Fundator (Lord Hercules is the Founder) superimposed.The official flag of Andalusia consists of three equal horizontal stripes, coloured green, white, and green respectively; the Andalusian coat of arms is superimposed on the central stripe. Its design was overseen by Blas Infante and approved in the Assembly of Ronda (a 1918 gathering of Andalusian nationalists at Ronda). Blas Infante considered these to have been the colours most used in regional symbols throughout the region's history. According to him, the green came in particular from the standard of the Umayyad Caliphate and represented the call for a gathering of the populace. The white symbolised pardon in the Almohad dynasty, interpreted in European heraldry as parliament or peace. Other writers have justified the colours differently, with some Andalusian nationalists referring to them as the Arbonaida, meaning white-and-green in Mozarabic, a Romance language that was spoken in the region in Muslim times. Nowadays, the Andalusian government states that the colours of the flag evoke the Andalusian landscape as well as values of purity and hope for the future.\n\nThe anthem of Andalusia was composed by Jos\u00e9 del Castillo D\u00edaz (director of the Municipal Band of Seville, commonly known as Maestro Castillo) with lyrics by Blas Infante. The music was inspired by Santo Dios, a popular religious song sung at harvest time by peasants and day labourers in the provinces of M\u00e1laga, Seville, and Huelva. Blas Infante brought the song to Maestro Castillo's attention; Maestro Castillo adapted and harmonized the traditional melody. The lyrics appeal to the Andalusians to mobilise and demand tierra y libertad (\"land and liberty\") by way of agrarian reform and a statute of autonomy within Spain.\nThe Parliament of Andalusia voted unanimously in 1983 that the preamble to the Statute of Autonomy recognise Blas Infante as the Father of the Andalusian Nation (Padre de la Patria Andaluza), which was reaffirmed in the reformed Statute of Autonomy submitted to popular referendum 18 February 2007. The preamble of the present 2007 Statute of Autonomy says that Article 2 of the present Spanish Constitution of 1978 recognises Andalusia as a nationality. Later, in its articulation, it speaks of Andalusia as a \"historic nationality\" (Spanish: nacionalidad hist\u00f3rica). It also cites the 1919 Andalusianist Manifesto of C\u00f3rdoba describing Andalusia as a \"national reality\" (realidad nacional), but does not endorse that formulation. Article 1 of the earlier 1981 Statute of Autonomy defined it simply as a \"nationality\" (nacionalidad).The national holiday, the D\u00eda de Andaluc\u00eda, is celebrated on 28 February, commemorating the 1980 autonomy referendum. In spite of this, nationalist groups celebrate the holiday on 4 December, commemorating the 1977 demonstrations to demand autonomy.The honorific title of Hijo Predilecto de Andaluc\u00eda (\"Favourite Son of Andalucia\") is granted by the Autonomous Government of Andalusia to those whose exceptional merits benefited Andalusia, for work or achievements in natural, social, or political science. It is the highest distinction given by the Autonomous Community of Andalusia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Sevillian historian Antonio Dom\u00ednguez Ortiz wrote that:\n\none must seek the essence of Andalusia in its geographic reality on the one hand, and on the other in the awareness of its inhabitants. From the geographic point of view, the whole of the southern lands is too vast and varied to be embraced as a single unit. In reality there are not two, but three Andalusias: the Sierra Morena, the Valley [of the Guadalquivir] and the [Cordillera] Penib\u00e9tica\n\n\n=== Location ===\nAndalusia has a surface area of 87,597 square kilometres (33,821 sq mi), 17.3 percent of the territory of Spain. Andalusia alone is comparable in extent and in the variety of its terrain to any of several of the smaller European countries. To the east is the Mediterranean Sea; to the west the Atlantic Ocean; to the north the Sierra Morena constitutes the border with the Meseta Central; to the south, the self-governing British overseas territory of Gibraltar and the Strait of Gibraltar separate it from Morocco.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAndalusia is home to the hottest and driest summers in Spain, but in the west, weather systems sweeping in from the Atlantic ensure that it is relatively wet in the winter, with some areas receiving copious amounts. Contrary to what many people think, as a whole, the region enjoys above-average yearly rainfall in the context of Spain.Andalusia sits at a latitude between 36\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 44' N, in the warm-temperate region. In general, it experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, with dry summers influenced by the Azores High, but subject to occasional torrential rains and extremely hot temperatures. In the winter, the tropical anticyclones move south, allowing cold polar fronts to penetrate the region. Still, within Andalusia there is considerable climatic variety. From the extensive coastal plains one may pass to the valley of the Guadalquivir, barely above sea level, then to the highest altitudes in the Iberian peninsula in the peaks of the Sierra Nevada. In a mere 50 km (31 mi) one can pass from the subtropical coast of the province of Granada to the snowy peaks of Mulhac\u00e9n. Andalusia also includes both the dry Tabernas Desert in the province of Almer\u00eda and the Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park in the province of C\u00e1diz, which experiences Spain's greatest rainfall.Annual rainfall in the Sierra de Grazalema has been measured as high as 4,346 millimetres (171.1 in) in 1963, the highest ever recorded for any location in Iberia. Andalusia is also home to the driest place in continental Europe, the Cabo de Gata, with only 117 millimetres (4.6 in) of rain per year.\nIn general, as one goes from west to east, away from the Atlantic, there is less precipitation. \"Wet Andalusia\" includes most of the highest points in the region, above all the Sierra de Grazalema but also the Serran\u00eda de Ronda in western M\u00e1laga. The valley of the Guadalquivir has moderate rainfall. The Tabernas Desert in Almer\u00eda, Europe's only true desert, has less than 75 days with any measurable precipitation, and some particular places in the desert have as few as 50 such days. Much of \"dry Andalusia\" has more than 300 \"sunny\" days a year.\nThe average temperature in Andalusia throughout the year is over 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). Averages in the cities range from 15.1 \u00b0C (59.2 \u00b0F) in Baeza to 19.1 \u00b0C (66.4 \u00b0F) in Almer\u00eda. Much of the Guadalquivir valley and the Mediterranean coast has an average of about 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F). The coldest month is January when Granada at the foot of the Sierra Nevada experiences an average temperature of 6.4 \u00b0C (43.5 \u00b0F). The hottest are July and August, with an average temperature of 28.5 \u00b0C (83.3 \u00b0F) for Andalusia as a whole. C\u00f3rdoba is the hottest provincial capital, followed by Seville.The Guadalquivir valley has experienced some of the highest temperatures recorded in Europe, with a maximum of 46.6 \u00b0C (115.9 \u00b0F) recorded at C\u00f3rdoba and Seville. The mountains of Granada and Ja\u00e9n have the coldest temperatures in southern Iberia, but do not reach continental extremes (and, indeed are surpassed by some mountains in northern Spain). In the cold snap of January 2005, Santiago de la Espada (Ja\u00e9n) experienced a temperature of \u221221 \u00b0C (\u22126 \u00b0F) and the ski resort at Sierra Nevada National Park\u2014the southernmost ski resort in Europe\u2014dropped to \u221218 \u00b0C (0 \u00b0F). Sierra Nevada Natural Park has Iberia's lowest average annual temperature, (3.9 \u00b0C or 39.0 \u00b0F at Pradollano) and its peaks remain snowy practically year-round.\n\n\n=== Terrain ===\n\nMountain ranges affect climate, the network of rivers, soils and their erosion, bioregions, and even human economies insofar as they rely on natural resources. The Andalusian terrain offers a range of altitudes and slopes. Andalusia has the Iberian peninsula's highest mountains and nearly 15 percent of its terrain over 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The picture is similar for areas under 100 metres (330 ft) (with the Baetic Depression), and for the variety of slopes.\nThe Atlantic coast is overwhelmingly beach and gradually sloping coasts; the Mediterranean coast has many cliffs, above all in the Malagan Axarqu\u00eda and in Granada and Almer\u00eda. This asymmetry divides the region naturally into Upper Andalusia (two mountainous areas) and Lower Andalusia (the broad basin of the Guadalquivir).The Sierra Morena separates Andalusia from the plains of Extremadura and Castile\u2013La Mancha on Spain's Meseta Central. Although sparsely populated, this is not a particularly high range, and its highest point, the 1,323-metre (4,341 ft) peak of La Ba\u00f1uela in the Sierra Madrona, lies outside of Andalusia. Within the Sierra Morena, the gorge of Despe\u00f1aperros forms a natural frontier between Castile and Andalusia.\nThe Baetic Cordillera consists of the parallel mountain ranges of the Cordillera Penib\u00e9tica near the Mediterranean coast and the Cordillera Subb\u00e9tica inland, separated by the Surco Intrab\u00e9tico. The Cordillera Subb\u00e9tica is quite discontinuous, offering many passes that facilitate transportation, but the Penib\u00e9tico forms a strong barrier between the Mediterranean coast and the interior. The Sierra Nevada, part of the Cordillera Penib\u00e9tica in the Province of Granada, has the highest peaks in Iberia: El Mulhac\u00e9n at 3,478 metres (11,411 ft) and El Veleta at 3,392 metres (11,129 ft).\nLower Andalusia, the Baetic Depression, the basin of the Guadalquivir, lies between these two mountainous areas. It is a nearly flat territory, open to the Gulf of C\u00e1diz in the southeast. Throughout history, this has been the most populous part of Andalusia.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nAndalusia has rivers that flow into both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Flowing to the Atlantic are the Guadiana, Odiel-Tinto, Guadalquivir, Guadalete, and Barbate. Flowing to the Mediterranean are the Guadiaro, Guadalhorce, Guadalmedina, Guadalfeo, Andarax (also known as the Almer\u00eda) and Almanzora. Of these, the Guadalquivir is the longest in Andalusia and fifth longest on the Iberian peninsula, at 657 kilometres (408 mi).\n\nThe rivers of the Atlantic basin are characteristically long, run through mostly flat terrain, and have broad river valleys. As a result, at their mouths are estuaries and wetlands, such as the marshes of Do\u00f1ana in the delta of the Guadalquivir, and wetlands of the Odiel. In contrast, the rivers of the Mediterranean Basin are shorter, more seasonal, and make a precipitous descent from the mountains of the Baetic Cordillera. Their estuaries are small, and their valleys are less suitable for agriculture. Also, being in the rain shadow of the Baetic Cordillera means that they receive a lesser volume of water.The following hydrographic basins can be distinguished in Andalusia. On the Atlantic side are the Guadalquivir basin; the Andalusian Atlantic Basin with the sub-basins Guadalete-Barbate and Tinto-Odiel; and the Guadiana basin. On the Mediterranean side is the Andalusian Mediterranean Basin and the upper portion of the basin of the Segura.\n\n\n=== Soils ===\nThe soils of Andalusia can be divided into three large areas: the Sierra Morena, Cordillera Subb\u00e9tica, and the Baetic Depression and the Surco Intrab\u00e9tico.The Sierra Morena, due to its morphology and the acidic content of its rocks, developed principally relatively poor, shallow soils, suitable only for forests. In the valleys and in some areas where limestone is present, deeper soils allowed farming of cereals suitable for livestock. The more complicated morphology of the Baetic Cordillera makes it more heterogeneous, with the most heterogeneous soils in Andalusia. Very roughly, in contrast to the Sierra Morena, a predominance of basic (alkaline) materials in the Cordillera Subb\u00e9tica, combined with a hilly landscape, generates deeper soils with greater agricultural capacity, suitable to the cultivation of olives.Finally, the Baetic Depression and the Surco Intrab\u00e9tico have deep, rich soils, with great agricultural capacity. In particular, the alluvial soils of the Guadalquivir valley and plain of Granada have a loamy texture and are particularly suitable for intensive irrigated crops. In the hilly areas of the countryside, there is a double dynamic: the depressions have filled with older lime-rich material, developing the deep, rich, dark clay soils the Spanish call bujeo, or tierras negras andaluzas, excellent for dryland farming. In other zones, the whiter albariza provides an excellent soil for vineyards.Despite their marginal quality, the poorly consolidated soils of the sandy coastline of Huelva and Almer\u00eda\nhave been successfully used in recent decades for hothouse cultivation under clear plastic of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and other fruits.\n\n\n=== Flora ===\n\nBiogeographically, Andalusia forms part of the Western Mediterranean subregion of the Mediterranean Basin, which falls within the Boreal Kingdom. Five floristic provinces lie, in whole or in part, within Andalusia: along much of the Atlantic coast, the Lusitanian-Andalusian littoral or Andalusian Atlantic littoral; in the north, the southern portion of the Luso-Extremaduran floristic province; covering roughly half of the region, the Baetic floristic province; and in the extreme east, the Almerian portion of the Almerian-Murcian floristic province and (coinciding roughly with the upper Segura basin) a small portion of the Castilian-Maestrazgan-Manchegan floristic province. These names derive primarily from past or present political geography: \"Luso\" and \"Lusitanian\" from Lusitania, one of three Roman provinces in Iberia, most of the others from present-day Spanish provinces, and Maestrazgo being a historical region of northern Valencia.\n\nIn broad terms, the typical vegetation of Andalusia is Mediterranean woodland, characterized by leafy xerophilic perennials, adapted to the long, dry summers. The dominant species of the climax community is the holly oak (Quercus ilex). Also abundant are cork oak (Quercus suber), various pines, and Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo). Due to cultivation, olive (Olea europaea) and almond (Prunus dulcis) trees also abound. The dominant understory is composed of thorny and aromatic woody species, such as rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), thyme (Thymus), and Cistus. In the wettest areas with acidic soils, the most abundant species are the oak and cork oak, and the cultivated Eucalyptus. In the woodlands, leafy hardwoods of genus Populus (poplars, aspens, cottonwoods) and Ulmus (elms) are also abundant; poplars are cultivated in the plains of Granada.The Andalusian woodlands have been much altered by human settlement, the use of nearly all of the best land for farming, and frequent wildfires. The degraded forests become shrubby and combustible garrigue. Extensive areas have been planted with non-climax trees such as pines. There is now a clear conservation policy for the remaining forests, which survive almost exclusively in the mountains.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\n\nThe biodiversity of Andalusia extends to its fauna as well. More than 400 of the 630 vertebrate species extant in Spain can be found in Andalusia. Spanning the Mediterranean and Atlantic basins, and adjacent to the Strait of Gibraltar, Andalusia is on the migratory route of many of the numerous flocks of birds that travel annually from Europe to Africa and back.The Andalusian wetlands host a rich variety of birds. Some are of African origin, such as the red-knobbed coot (Fulica cristata), the purple swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio), and the greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus). Others originate in Northern Europe, such as the greylag goose (Anser anser). Birds of prey (raptors) include the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti), the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), and both the black and red kite (Milvus migrans and Milvus milvus).\n\nAmong the herbivores, are several deer (Cervidae) species, notably the fallow deer (Dama dama) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus); the European mouflon (Ovis orientalis musimon), a type of sheep; and the Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica, which despite its scientific name is no longer found in the Pyrenees). The Spanish ibex has recently been losing ground to the Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), an invasive species from Africa, introduced for hunting in the 1970s. Among the small herbivores are rabbits\u2014especially the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)\u2014which form the most important part of the diet of the carnivorous species of the Mediterranean woodlands.\nThe large carnivores such as the Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus) and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) are quite threatened, and are limited to the Sierra de And\u00fajar, inside of Sierra Morena, Do\u00f1ana and Despe\u00f1aperros. Stocks of the wild boar (Sus scrofa), on the other hand, have been well preserved because they are popular with hunters. More abundant and in varied situations of conservation are such smaller carnivores as otters, dogs, foxes, the European badger (Meles meles), the European polecat (Mustela putorius), the least weasel (Mustela nivalis), the wildcat (Felis silvestris), the common genet (Genetta genetta), and the Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon).Other notable species are Acherontia atropos (a variety of death's-head hawkmoth), Vipera latasti (a venomous snake), and the endemic (and endangered) fish Aphanius baeticus.\n\n\n=== Protected areas ===\n\nAndalusia has many unique ecosystems. In order to preserve these areas in a manner compatible with both conservation and economic exploitation, many of the most representative ecosystems have been given protected status.The various levels of protection are encompassed within the Network of Protected Natural Spaces of Andalusia (Red de Espacios Naturales Protegidos de Andaluc\u00eda, RENPA) which integrates all protected natural spaces located in Andalusia, whether they are protected at the level of the local community, the autonomous community of Andalusia, the Spanish state, or by international conventions. RENPA consists of 150 protected spaces, consisting of two national parks, 24 natural parks, 21 periurban parks (on the fringes of cities or towns), 32 natural sites, two protected countrysides, 37 natural monuments, 28 nature reserves, and four concerted nature reserves (in which a government agency coordinates with the owner of the property for its management), all part of the European Union's Natura 2000 network. Under the international ambit are the nine Biosphere Reserves, 20 Ramsar wetland sites, four Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance and two UNESCO Geoparks.In total, nearly 20 percent of the territory of Andalusia lies in one of these protected areas, which constitute roughly 30 percent of the protected territory of Spain. Among these many spaces, some of the most notable are the Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park, Spain's largest natural park and the second largest in Europe, the Sierra Nevada National Park, Do\u00f1ana National Park and Natural Park, the Tabernas Desert, and the Cabo de Gata-N\u00edjar Natural Park, the largest terrestrial-maritime reserve in the European Western Mediterranean Sea.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe geostrategic position of Andalusia in the extreme south of Europe, providing (along with Morocco) a gateway between Europe and Africa, added to its position between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, as well as its rich deposits of minerals and its agricultural wealth, have made Andalusia a tempting prize for civilizations since prehistoric times. Add to this its area of 87,268 square kilometres (33,694 sq mi) (larger than many European countries), and it can be no surprise that Andalusia has figured prominently in the history of Europe and the Mediterranean.\nSeveral theories postulate that the first hominids in Europe were in Andalusia, having passed across the Strait of Gibraltar; the earliest known paintings of humanity have been found in the Caves of Nerja, M\u00e1laga. The first settlers, based on artifacts from the archaeological sites at Los Millares, El Argar, and Tartessos, were clearly influenced by cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean who arrived on the Andalusian coast. Andalusia then went through a period of protohistory, when the region did not have a written language of its own, but its existence was known to and documented by literate cultures, principally the Phoenicians and Ancient Greeks, wide historical moment in which C\u00e1diz was founded, regarded by many as the oldest city still standing in Western Europe; another city among the oldest is M\u00e1laga. During the second millennium BCE, the kingdom of Tartessos developed in Andalusia.\n\n\n=== Carthaginians and Romans ===\n\nWith the fall of the original Phoenician cities in the East, Carthage \u2014 itself the most significant Phoenician colony \u2014 became the dominant sea power of the western Mediterranean and the most important trading partner for the Phoenician towns along the Andalusian coast. Between the First and Second Punic Wars, Carthage extended its control beyond Andalucia to include all of Iberia except the Basque Country. Andalusia was the major staging ground for the war with Rome led by the Carthaginian general Hannibal. The Romans defeated the Carthaginians and conquered Andalusia, the region being renamed Baetica. It was fully incorporated into the Roman Empire, and from this region came many Roman magistrates and senators, as well as the emperors Trajan and (most likely) Hadrian.\n\n\n=== Vandals, Visigoths and the Byzantine Empire ===\nThe Vandals moved briefly through the region during the 5th century AD before settling in North Africa, after which the region fell into the hands of the Visigothic Kingdom. The Visigoths in this region were practically independent of the Visigothic Catholic Kingdom of Toledo. This is the era of Saints Isidore of Seville and Hermenegild. During this period, around 555 AD, the Eastern Roman Empire conquered Andalusia under Justinian I, the Eastern Roman Emperor. They established Spania, a province of the Byzantine Empire from 552 until 624. Though their holdings were quickly reduced, they continued to have interests in the region until it was lost altogether in 624.\n\n\n=== Al-Andalus states ===\n\nThe Visigothic era came to an abrupt end in 711 with the Umayyad conquest of Hispania by the Muslim Umayyad general Tariq ibn Ziyad. Tariq is known in Umayyad history and legend as a formidable conqueror who dared and bore the nerve to burn his fleet of ships, when he landed with his troops on the coast of Gibraltar \u2013 an acronym of \"Jabel alTariq\" meaning \"the mountain of Tariq\". When the Muslim invaders seized control and consolidated their dominion of the region, they remained tolerant to the population faiths, but they also needed a place for their own faith. In the 750s, they forcibly rented half of Cordoba's Cathedral of San Vicente (Visigothic) to use as a mosque.\n The mosque's hypostyle plan, consisting of a rectangular prayer hall and an enclosed courtyard, followed a tradition established in the Umayyad and Abbasid mosques of Syria and Iraq.  However, the dramatic articulation of the interior of the prayer hall was unprecedented.  The system of columns supporting double arcades of piers and arches with alternating red and white voussoirs is an unusual treatment that, structurally, combined striking visual effect with the practical advantage of providing greater height within the hall.  Alternating red and white voussoirs are associated with Umayyad monuments such as the Great Mosque of Damascus and the Dome of the Rock. Their use in the Great Mosque of Cordoba manages to create a stunningly original visual composition even as it emphasises 'Abd al-Rahman's connection to the established Umayyad tradition.In this period, the name \"Al-Andalus\" was applied to the Iberian Peninsula, and later it referred to the parts not controlled by the Gothic states in the North. The Muslim rulers in Al-Andalus were economic invaders and interested in collecting taxes; social changes imposed on the native populace were mainly confined to geographical, political and legal conveniences. Al-Andalus remained connected to other states under Muslim rule; also trade routes between it and Constantinople and Alexandria remained open, while many cultural features of the Roman Empire were transmitted throughout Europe and the Near East by its successor state, the Byzantine Empire. Byzantine architecture is an example of such cultural diffusion continuing even after the collapse of the empire.Nevertheless, the Guadalquivir River valley became the point of power projection in the peninsula with the Caliphate of Cordoba making Cordoba its capital. The Umayyad Caliphate produced such leaders as Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman III (ruled 912\u2013961) and his son, Caliph Al-Hakam II (ruled 961\u2013976) and built the magnificent Great Mosque of Cordoba. Under these rulers, Cordoba was the center of economic and cultural significance.By the 10th century, the northern Kingdoms of Spain and other European Crowns had begun what would eventually become the Reconquista: the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula for Christendom. Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman suffered some minor military defeats, but often managed to manipulate the Gothic northern kingdoms to act against each other's interests. Al-Hakam achieved military successes, but at the expense of uniting the north against him.\n\nAfter the conquest of Toledo in 1086 by Alfonso VI, the Crown of Castille and the Crown of Aragon dominated large parts of the peninsula. The main Taifas therefore had to resort to assistance from various other powers across the Mediterranean. A number of different Muslim dynasties of North African origin\u2014notably Almoravid dynasty and Almohad dynasty\u2014dominated a slowly diminishing Al-Andalus over the next several centuries.After the victory at the Battle of Sagrajas (1086) put a temporary stop to Castile expansion, the Almoravid dynasty reunified Al-Andalus with its capital in Granada, ruling until the mid-12th century. The various Taifa kingdoms were assimilated. the Almohad dynasty expansion in North Africa weakened Al-Andalus, and in 1170 the Almohads transferred their capital from Marrakesh to Seville. The victory at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212) marked the beginning of the end of the Almohad dynasty.\n\n\n=== Crown of Castile ===\nThe weakness caused by the collapse of Almohad power and the subsequent creation of new Taifas, each with its own ruler, led to the rapid Castile reconquest of the valley of the Guadalquivir. C\u00f3rdoba was regained in 1236 and Seville in 1248. The fall of Granada on 2 January 1492 put an end to the Nasrid rule, event that marks the beginning of Andalusia, the southern four territories of the Crown of Castile in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nSeven months later, on 3 August 1492 Christopher Columbus left the town of Palos de la Frontera, Huelva, with the first expedition that resulted in the Discovery of the Americas, that would end the Middle Ages and signal the beginning of modernity. Many Castilians participated in this and other expeditions that followed, some of them known as the Minor or Andalusian Journeys.\nContacts between Spain and the Americas, including royal administration and the shipping trade from Asia and America for over three hundred years, came almost exclusively through the south of Spain, specially Seville and Cadiz ports.As a result, it became the wealthiest, most influential region in Spain and amongst the most influential in Europe. For example, the Habsburg diverted much of this trade wealth to control its European territories.\n\n\n=== Hapsburg Spain ===\nIn the first half of the 16th century plague was still prevalent in Spain. According to George C. Kohn, \"One of the worst epidemics of the century, whose miseries were accompanied by severe drought and food shortage, started in 1505; by 1507, about 100,000 people had died in Andalusia alone. Andalusia was struck once again in 1646. For three years, plague haunted the entire region, causing perhaps as many as 200,000 deaths, especially in M\u00e1laga and Seville.\"\n\nFollowing the Second Rebellion of the Alpujarras in 1568\u20131571, the Moorish population\u2014that is, unconverted Moriscos\u2014were expelled from Kingdom of Castile (and Aragon). However, by order of the Spanish crown, two Moorish families were required to remain in each village in order to demonstrate to the new inhabitants, introduced from northern Spain, the workings of the terracing and irrigation systems on which the district's agriculture depends.In 1810\u201312 Spanish troops strongly resisted the French occupation during the Peninsular War (part of the Napoleonic Wars).Andalusia profited from the Spanish overseas empire, although much trade and finance eventually came to be controlled by other parts of Europe to where it was ultimately destined. In the 18th century, commerce from other parts of Spain began to displace Andalusian commerce when the Spanish government ended Andalusia's trading monopoly with the colonies in the Americas. The loss of the empire in the 1820s hurt the economy of the region, particularly the cities that had benefited from the trade and ship building. The construction of railways in the latter part of the 19th century enabled Andalusia to better develop its agricultural potential and it became an exporter of food. While industrialisation was taking off in the northern Spanish regions of Catalonia and the Basque country, Andalusia remained traditional and displayed a deep social division between a small class of wealthy landowners and a population made up largely of poor agricultural labourers and tradesmen.\n\n\n=== Francoist oppressions ===\n\nAndalusia was one of the worst affected regions of Spain by Francisco Franco's brutal campaign of mass-murder and political suppression called the White Terror during and after the Spanish Civil War. The Nationalist rebels bombed and seized the working-class districts of the main Andalusian cities in the first days of the war, and afterwards went on to execute thousands of workers and militants of the leftist parties: in the city of Cordoba 4,000; in the city of Granada 5,000; in the city of Seville 3,028; and in the city of Huelva 2,000 killed and 2,500 disappeared. The city of M\u00e1laga, occupied by the Nationalists in February 1937 following the Battle of M\u00e1laga, experienced one of the harshest repressions following Francoist victory with an estimated total of 17,000 people summarily executed. Carlos Arias Navarro, then a young lawyer who as public prosecutor signed thousands of execution warrants in the trials set up by the triumphant rightists, became known as \"The Butcher of M\u00e1laga\" (Carnicero de M\u00e1laga).Paul Preston estimates the total number of victims of deliberately killed by the Nationalists in Andalusia at 55,000.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nAndalusia is one of the 17 autonomous communities of Spain. The Regional Government of Andalusia (Spanish: Junta de Andaluc\u00eda) includes the Parliament of Andalusia, its chosen president, a Consultative Council, and other bodies.\nThe Autonomous Community of Andalusia was formed in accord with a referendum of 28 February 1980 and became an autonomous community under the 1981 Statute of Autonomy known as the Estatuto de Carmona. The process followed the Spanish Constitution of 1978, still current as of 2009, which recognizes and guarantees the right of autonomy for the various regions and nationalities of Spain. The process to establish Andalusia as an autonomous region followed Article 151 of the Constitution, making Andalusia the only autonomous community to take that particular course. That article was set out for regions like Andalusia that had been prevented by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War from adopting a statute of autonomy during the period of the Second Spanish Republic.\nArticle 1 of the 1981 Statute of Autonomy justifies autonomy based on the region's \"historical identity, on the self-government that the Constitution permits every nationality, on outright equality to the rest of the nationalities and regions that compose Spain, and with a power that emanates from the Andalusian Constitution and people, reflected in its Statute of Autonomy\".In October 2006 the constitutional commission of the Cortes Generales (the national legislature of Spain), with favorable votes from the left-of-center Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), the leftist United Left (IU) and the right-of-center People's Party (PP), approved a new Statute of Autonomy for Andalusia, whose preamble refers to the community as a \"national reality\" (realidad nacional):\n\nThe Andalusianist Manifesto of C\u00f3rdoba described Andalusia as a national reality in 1919, whose spirit the Andalusians took up outright through the process of self-government recognized in our Magna Carta. In 1978 the Andalusians broadly backed the constitutional consensus. Today, the Constitution, in its Article 2, recognizes Andalusia as a nationality as part of the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation.\nOn 2 November 2006 the Spanish Chamber Deputies ratified the text of the Constitutional Commission with 306 votes in favor, none opposed, and 2 abstentions. This was the first time a Spanish Organic Law adopting a Statute of Autonomy was approved with no opposing votes. The Senate, in a plenary session of 20 December 2006, ratified the referendum to be voted upon by the Andalusian public 18 February 2007.\nThe Statute of Autonomy spells out Andalusia's distinct institutions of government and administration. Chief among these is the Andalusian Autonomous Government (Junta de Andaluc\u00eda). Other institutions specified in the Statute are the Defensor del Pueblo Andaluz (literally \"Defender of the Andalusian People\", basically an ombudsperson), the Consultative Council, the Chamber of Accounts, the Audiovisual Council of Andalusia, and the Economic and Social Council.\nThe Andalusian Statute of Autonomy recognizes Seville as the region's capital. The Andalusian Autonomous Government is located there. However, the region's highest court, the High Court of Andalusia (Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Andaluc\u00eda) is not part of the Autonomous Government, and has its seat in Granada.\n\n\n=== Autonomous Government ===\n\nThe Andalusian Autonomous Government (Junta de Andaluc\u00eda) is the institution of self-government of the Autonomous Community of Andalusia. Within the government, the President of the Regional Government of Andalusia is the supreme representative of the autonomous community, and the ordinary representative of the Spanish state in the autonomous community. The president is formally named to the position by the Monarch of Spain and then confirmed by a majority vote of the Parliament of Andalusia. In practice, the monarch always names a person acceptable to the ruling party or coalition of parties in the autonomous region. In theory, were the candidate to fail to gain the needed majority, the monarch could propose a succession of candidates. After two months, if no proposed candidate could gain the parliament's approval, the parliament would automatically be dissolved and the acting president would call new elections. On 5 September 2013 Susana D\u00edaz was elected president.\nThe Council of Government, the highest political and administrative organ of the Community, exercises regulatory and executive power. The President presides over the council, which also includes the heads of various departments (Consejer\u00edas). In the current legislature (2008\u20132012), there are 15 of these departments. In order of precedence, they are Presidency, Governance, Economy and Treasury, Education, Justice and Public Administration, Innovation, Science and Business, Public Works and Transportation, Employment, Health, Agriculture and Fishing, Housing and Territorial Planning, Tourism, Commerce and Sports, Equality and Social Welfare, Culture, and Environment.\nThe Parliament of Andalusia, its Autonomic Legislative Assembly, develops and approves laws and elects and removes the President. Elections to the Andalusian Parliament follow a democratic formula through which the citizens elect 109 representatives. After the approval of the Statute of Autonomy through Organic Law 6/1981 on 20 December 1981, the first elections to the autonomic parliament took place 23 May 1982. Further elections have occurred in 1986, 1990, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008.\nThe current (2008\u20132012) legislature includes representatives of the PSOE-A (Andalusian branch of the left-of-center PSOE), PP-A (Andalusian branch of the right-of-center PP) and IULV-CA (Andalusian branch of the leftist IU).\n\n\n=== Judicial power ===\nThe High Court of Andalusia (Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Andaluc\u00eda) in Granada is subject only to the higher jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Spain. The High Court is not an organ of the Autonomous Community, but rather of the Judiciary of Spain, which is unitary throughout the kingdom and whose powers are not transferred to the autonomous communities. The Andalusian territory is divided into 88 legal/judicial districts (partidos judiciales).\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Provinces ===\n\nAndalusia consists of eight provinces. The latter were established by Javier de Burgos in the 1833 territorial division of Spain. Each of the Andalusian provinces bears the same name as its capital:\nAndalusia is traditionally divided into two historical subregions: Upper Andalusia or Eastern Andalusia (Andaluc\u00eda Oriental), consisting of the provinces of Almer\u00eda, Granada, Ja\u00e9n, and M\u00e1laga, and Lower Andalusia or Western Andalusia (Andaluc\u00eda Occidental), consisting of the provinces of C\u00e1diz, C\u00f3rdoba, Huelva and Seville.\n\n\n=== Comarcas and mancomunidades ===\n\nWithin the various autonomous communities of Spain, comarcas are comparable to shires (or, in some countries, counties) in the English-speaking world. Unlike in some of Spain's other autonomous communities, under the original 1981 Statute of Autonomy, the comarcas of Andalusia had no formal recognition, but, in practice, they still had informal recognition as geographic, cultural, historical, or in some cases administrative entities. The 2007 Statute of Autonomy echoes this practice, and mentions comarcas in Article 97 of Title III, which defines the significance of comarcas and establishes a basis for formal recognition in future legislation.The current statutory entity that most closely resembles a comarca is the mancomunidad, a freely chosen, bottom-up association of municipalities intended as an instrument of socioeconomic development and coordination between municipal governments in specific areas.\n\n\n=== Municipalities and local entities ===\n\nBeyond the level of provinces, Andalusia is further divided into 774 municipalities (municipios). The municipalities of Andalusia are regulated by Title III of the Statute of Autonomy, Articles 91\u201395, which establishes the municipality as the basic territorial entity of Andalusia, each of which has legal personhood and autonomy in many aspects of its internal affairs. At the municipal level, representation, government and administration is performed by the ayuntamiento (municipal government), which has competency for urban planning, community social services, supply and treatment of water, collection and treatment of waste, and promotion of tourism, culture, and sports, among other matters established by law.Among the more important Andalusian cities besides the provincial capitals are:\n\nEl Ejido, N\u00edjar and Roquetas de Mar (Almer\u00eda)\nLa L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n, Algeciras, Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, San Fernando, Chiclana de la Frontera, Puerto Real, Arcos de la Frontera, Jerez and El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda (C\u00e1diz)\nLucena, Pozoblanco, Montilla and Puente Genil (C\u00f3rdoba)\nAlmu\u00f1\u00e9car, Guadix, Loja and Motril (Granada)\nLinares, And\u00fajar, \u00dabeda and Baeza (Ja\u00e9n)\nMarbella, Mijas, V\u00e9lez-M\u00e1laga, Fuengirola, Torremolinos, Estepona, Benalm\u00e1dena, Antequera, Rinc\u00f3n de la Victoria and Ronda (M\u00e1laga)\nUtrera, Dos Hermanas, Alcal\u00e1 de Guada\u00edra, Osuna, Mairena del Aljarafe, \u00c9cija and Lebrija (Sevilla)In conformity with the intent to devolve control as locally as possible, in many cases, separate nuclei of population within municipal borders each administer their own interests. These are variously known as pedan\u00edas (\"hamlets\"), villas (\"villages\"), aldeas (also usually rendered as \"villages\"), or other similar names.\n\n\n=== Main cities ===\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAndalusia ranks first by population among the 17 autonomous communities of Spain. The estimated population at the beginning of 2009 was 8,285,692. The population is concentrated, above all, in the provincial capitals and along the coasts, so that the level of urbanization is quite high; half the population is concentrated in the 28 cities of more than 50,000 inhabitants. The population is aging, although the process of immigration is countering the inversion of the population pyramid.\n\n\n=== Population change ===\nAt the end of the 20th century, Andalusia was in the last phase of demographic transition. The death rate stagnated at around 8\u20139 per thousand, and the population came to be influenced mainly by birth and migration.\n\nIn 1950, Andalusia had 20.04 percent of the national population of Spain. By 1981, this had declined to 17.09 percent. Although the Andalusian population was not declining in absolute terms, these relative losses were due to emigration great enough to nearly counterbalance having the highest birth rate in Spain. Since the 1980s, this process has reversed on all counts, and as of 2009, Andalusia has 17.82 percent of the Spanish population.\nThe birth rate is sharply down, as is typical in developed economies, although it has lagged behind much of the rest of the world in this respect. Furthermore, prior emigrants have been returning to Andalusia. Beginning in the 1990s, others have been immigrating in large numbers as well, as Spain has become a country of net immigration.At the beginning of the 21st century, statistics show a slight increase in the birth rate, due in large part to the higher birth rate among immigrants. The result is that as of 2009, the trend toward rejuvenation of the population is among the strongest of any autonomous community of Spain, or of any comparable region in Europe.\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the population structure of Andalusia shows a clear inversion of the population pyramid, with the largest cohorts falling between ages 25 and 50. Comparison of the population pyramid in 2008 to that in 1986 shows:\n\nA clear decrease in the population under the age of 25, due to a declining birth rate.\nAn increase in the adult population, as the earlier, larger cohort born in the \"baby boom\" of the 1960s and 1970s reach adulthood. This effect has been exacerbated by immigration: the largest contingent of immigrants are young adults.\nA further increase in the adult population, and especially the older adult population, due to increased life expectancy.As far as composition by sex, two aspects stand out: the higher percentage of women in the elderly population, owing to women's longer life expectancy, and, on the other hand, the higher percentage of men of working age, due in large part to a predominantly male immigrant population.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2005, 5.35 percent of the population of Andalusia were born outside of Spain. This is a relatively low number for a Spanish region, the national average being three percentage points higher. The immigrants are not evenly distributed among the Andalusian provinces: Almer\u00eda, with a 15.20 percent immigrant population, is third among all provinces in Spain, while at the other extreme Ja\u00e9n is only 2.07 percent immigrants and C\u00f3rdoba 1.77 percent. The predominant nationalities among the immigrant populations are Moroccan (92,500, constituting 17.79 percent of the foreigners living in Andalusia) and British (15.25 percent across the region). When comparing world regions rather than individual countries, the single largest immigrant block is from the region of Latin America, outnumbering not only all North Africans, but also all non-Spanish Western Europeans. Demographically, this group has provided an important addition to the Andalusian labor force.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAndalusia is traditionally an agricultural area, but the service sector (particularly tourism, retail sales, and transportation) now predominates. The once booming construction sector, hit hard by the 2009 recession, was also important to the region's economy. The industrial sector is less developed than most other regions in Spain.\nBetween 2000\u20132006 economic growth per annum was 3.72%, one of the highest in the country. Still, according to the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (INE), the GDP per capita of Andalusia (\u20ac17,401; 2006) remains the second lowest in Spain, with only Extremadura lagging behind. The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the autonomous community was 160.6 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 13.4% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 20,500 euros or 68% of the EU27 average in the same year.\n\n\n=== Primary sector ===\nThe primary sector, despite adding the least of the three sectors to the regional GDP remains important, especially when compared to typical developed economies. The primary sector produces 8.26 percent of regional GDP, 6.4 percent of its GVA and employs 8.19 percent of the workforce. In monetary terms it could be considered a rather uncompetitive sector, given its level of productivity compared to other Spanish regions. In addition to its numeric importance relative to other regions, agriculture and other primary sector activities have strong roots in local culture and identity.\nThe primary sector is divided into a number of subsectors: agriculture, commercial fishing, animal husbandry, hunting, forestry, mining, and energy.\n\n\n==== Agriculture, husbandry, hunting, and forestry ====\n\nFor many centuries, agriculture dominated Andalusian society, and, with 44.3 percent of its territory cultivated and 8.4 percent of its workforce in agriculture as of 2016, it remains an integral part of Andalusia's economy. However, its importance is declining, as is that of the primary and secondary sectors generally, as the service sector is increasingly taking over. The primary cultivation is dryland farming of cereals and sunflowers without artificial irrigation, especially in the vast countryside of the Guadalquivir valley and the high plains of Granada and Almer\u00eda-with a considerably lesser and more geographically focused cultivation of barley and oats. Using irrigation, maize, cotton and rice are also grown on the banks of the Guadalquivir and Genil.\n\nThe most important tree crops are olives, especially in the Subbetic regions of the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and J\u00e1en, where irrigated olive orchards constitute a large component of agricultural output. There are extensive vineyards in various zones such as Jerez de la Frontera (sherry), Condado de Huelva, Montilla-Moriles and M\u00e1laga. Fruits\u2014mainly citrus fruits\u2014are grown near the banks of the Guadalquivir; almonds, which require far less water, are grown on the high plains of Granada and Almer\u00eda.In monetary terms, by far the most productive and competitive agriculture in Andalusia is the intensive forced cultivation of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and other fruits grown under hothouse conditions under clear plastic, often in sandy zones, on the coasts, in Almer\u00eda and Huelva.\n\nOrganic farming has recently undergone rapid expansion in Andalusia, mainly for export to European markets but with increasing demand developing in Spain.Andalusia has a long tradition of animal husbandry and livestock farming, but it is now restricted mainly to mountain meadows, where there is less pressure from other potential uses. Andalusians have a long and colourful history of dog breeding that can be observed throughout the region today. The raising of livestock now plays a semi-marginal role in the Andalusian economy, constituting only 15 percent of the primary sector, half the number for Spain taken as a whole.\"Extensive\" raising of livestock grazes the animals on natural or cultivated pastures, whereas \"intensive\" raising of livestock is based in fodder rather than pasture. Although the productivity is higher than with extensive techniques, the economics are quite different. While intensive techniques now dominate in Europe and even in other regions of Spain, most of Andalusia's cattle, virtually all of its sheep and goats, and a good portion of its pigs are raised by extensive farming in mountain pastures. This includes the Black Iberian pigs that are the source of Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico. Andalusia's native sheep and goats present a great economic opportunity in a Europe where animal products are generally in strong supply, but the sheep and goat meat, milk, and leather (and the products derived from these) are relatively scarce. Dogs are bred not just as companion animals, but also as herding animals used by goat and sheep herders.\nHunting remains relatively important in Andalusia, but has largely lost its character as a means of obtaining food.\nIt is now more of a leisure activity linked to the mountain areas and complementary to forestry and the raising of livestock. Dogs are frequently used as hunting companions to retrieve killed game.\nThe Andalusian forests are important for their extent\u201450 percent of the territory of Andalusia\u2014and for other less quantifiable environmental reasons, such as their value in preventing erosion, regulating the flow of water necessary for other flora and fauna. For these reasons, there is legislation in place to protect the Andalusian forests. The value of forest products as such constitutes only 2 percent of agricultural production. This comes mostly from cultivated species\u2014eucalyptus in Huelva and poplar in Granada\u2014as well as naturally occurring cork oak in the Sierra Morena.\n\n\n==== Fishing ====\n\nFishing is a longstanding tradition on the Andalusian coasts. Fish and other seafood have long figured prominently in the local diet and in the local gastronomic culture: fried fish (pescaito frito in local dialect), white prawns, almadraba tuna, among others. The Andalusian fishing fleet is Spain's second largest, after Galicia, and Andalusia's 38 fishing ports are the most of any Spanish autonomous community. Commercial fishing produces only 0.5 percent of the product of the regional primary sector by value, but there are areas where it has far greater importance. In the province of Huelva it constitutes 20 percent of the primary sector, and locally in Punta Umbr\u00eda 70 percent of the work force is involved in commercial fishing.Failure to comply with fisheries laws regarding the use of trawling, urban pollution of the seacoast, destruction of habitats by coastal construction (for example, alteration of the mouths of rivers, construction of ports), and diminution of fisheries by overexploitation\nhave created a permanent crisis in the Andalusian fisheries, justifying attempts to convert the fishing fleet. The decrease in fish stocks has led to the rise of aquaculture, including fish farming both on the coasts and in the interior.\n\n\n==== Mining ====\nDespite the general poor returns in recent years, mining retains a certain importance in Andalusia. Andalusia produces half of Spain's mining product by value. Of Andalusia's production, roughly half comes from the province of Huelva. Mining for precious metals at Minas de Riotinto in Huelva (see Rio Tinto Group) dates back to pre-Roman times; the mines were abandoned in the Middle Ages and rediscovered in 1556. Other mining activity is coal mining in the Guadiato valley in the province of C\u00f3rdoba; various metals at Aznalc\u00f3llar in the province of Seville, and iron at Alquife in the province of Granada. In addition, limestone, clay, and other materials used in construction are well distributed throughout Andalusia.\n\n\n=== Secondary sector: industry ===\nThe Andalusian industrial sector has always been relatively small. Nevertheless, in 2007, Andalusian industry earned 11.979 million euros and employed more than 290,000 workers. This represented 9.15 percent of regional GDP, far below the 15.08 the secondary sector represents in the economy of Spain as a whole. By analyzing the different subsectors of the food industry Andalusian industry accounts for more than 16% of total production. In a comparison with the Spanish economy, this subsector is virtually the only food that has some weight in the national economy with 16.16%. Lies far behind the manufacturing sector of shipping materials just over 10% of the Spanish economy. Companies like Cruzcampo (Heineken Group), Puleva, Domecq, Santana Motors or Renault-Andalusia, are exponents of these two subsectors. Of note is the Andalusian aeronautical sector, which is second nationally only behind Madrid and represents approximately 21% of total turnover in terms of employment, highlighting companies like Airbus, Airbus Military, or the newly formed Aerospace Alestis. On the contrary it is symptomatic of how little weight the regional economy in such important sectors such as textiles or electronics at the national level.Andalusian industry is also characterized by a specialization in industrial activities of transforming raw agricultural and mineral materials. This is largely done by small enterprises without the public or foreign investment more typical of a high level of industrialization.\n\n\n=== Tertiary sector: services ===\n\nIn recent decades the Andalusian tertiary (service) sector has grown greatly, and has come to constitute the majority of the regional economy, as is typical of contemporary economies in developed nations. In 1975 the service sector produced 51.1 percent of local GDP and employed 40.8 percent of the work force. In 2007, this had risen to 67.9 percent of GDP and 66.42 percent of jobs. This process of \"tertiarization\" of the economy has followed a somewhat unusual course in Andalusia. This growth occurred somewhat earlier than in most developed economies and occurred independently of the local industrial sector. There were two principal reasons that \"tertiarization\" followed a different course in Andalusia than elsewhere:\n1. Andalusian capital found it impossible to compete in the industrial sector against more developed regions, and was obligated to invest in sectors that were easier to enter.\n2. The absence of an industrial sector that could absorb displaced agricultural workers and artisans led to the proliferation of services with rather low productivity. This unequal development compared to other regions led to a hypertrophied and unproductive service sector, which has tended to reinforce underdevelopment, because it has not led to large accumulations of capital.\n\n\n==== Tourism in Andalusia ====\n\nDue in part to the relatively mild winter and spring climate, the south of Spain is attractive to overseas visitors\u2013especially tourists from Northern Europe. While inland areas such as Ja\u00e9n, C\u00f3rdoba and the hill villages and towns remain relatively untouched by tourism, the coastal areas of Andalusia have heavy visitor traffic for much of the year.\nAmong the autonomous communities, Andalusia is second only to Catalonia in tourism, with nearly 30 million visitors every year. The principal tourist destinations in Andalusia are the Costa del Sol and (secondarily) the Sierra Nevada. As discussed above, Andalusia is one of the sunniest and warmest places in Europe, making it a center of \"sun and sand\" tourism, but not only it. Around 70 percent of the lodging capacity and 75 percent of the nights booked in Andalusian hotels are in coastal municipalities. The largest number of tourists come in August\u201413.26 percent of the nights booked throughout the year\u2014and the smallest number in December\u20145.36 percent.\n\nOn the west (Atlantic) coast are the Costa de la Luz (provinces of Huelva and C\u00e1diz), and on the east (Mediterranean) coast, the Costa del Sol (provinces of C\u00e1diz y M\u00e1laga), Costa Tropical (Granada and part of Almer\u00eda) and the Costa de Almer\u00eda. In 2004, the Blue Flag beach program of the non-profit Foundation for Environmental Education recognized 66 Andalusian beaches and 18 pleasure craft ports as being in a good state of conservation in terms of sustainability, accessibility, and quality. Nonetheless, the level of tourism on the Andalusian coasts has been high enough to have a significant environmental impact, and other organizations\u2014such as the Spanish Ecologists in Action (Ecologistas en Acci\u00f3n) with their description of \"Black Flag beaches\" or Greenpeace\u2014have expressed the opposite sentiment. However, Hotel chains such as Fuerte Hotels have ensured that sustainability within the tourism industry is one of their highest priorities.Together with \"sand and sun\" tourism, there has also been a strong increase in nature tourism in the interior, as well as cultural tourism, sport tourism, and conventions. One example of sport and nature tourism is the ski resort at Sierra Nevada National Park.\nAs for cultural tourism, there are hundreds of cultural tourist destinations: cathedrals, castles, forts, monasteries, and historic city centers and a wide variety of museums.\nIt can be highlighted that Spain has seven of its 42 cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Andalucia:\n\nAlhambra, Generalife and Albayz\u00edn, Granada (1984,1994)\nAntequera Dolmens Site (2016)\n10th Century Caliphate City of Medina Azahara (2018)\nCathedral, Alc\u00e1zar and Archivo de Indias in Seville (1987)\nHistoric Centre of Cordoba (1984,1994)\nRenaissance Monumental Ensembles of \u00dabeda and Baeza (2003)\nRock Art of the Mediterranean Basin on the Iberian Peninsula (1998)Further, there are the Lugares colombinos, significant places in the life of Christopher Columbus: Palos de la Frontera, La R\u00e1bida Monastery, and Moguer) in the province of Huelva. There are also archeological sites of great interest: the Roman city of Italica, birthplace of Emperor Trajan and (most likely) Hadrian or Baelo Claudia near Tarifa.\n\nAndalusia was the birthplace of such great painters as Vel\u00e1zquez and Murillo (Seville) and, more recently, Picasso (M\u00e1laga); Picasso is memorialized by his native city at the Museo Picasso M\u00e1laga and Natal House Foundation; the Casa de Murillo was a house museum 1982\u20131998, but is now mostly offices for the Andalusian Council of Culture. The CAC M\u00e1laga (Museum of Modern Art) is the most visited museum of Andalusia and has offered exhibitions of artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Gerhard Richter, Anish Kapoor, Ron Mueck or Rodney Graham. Malaga is also located part of the private Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection at Carmen Thyssen Museum.\nThere are numerous other significant museums around the region, both of paintings and of archeological artifacts such as gold jewelry, pottery and other ceramics, and other works that demonstrate the region's artisanal traditions.\nThe Council of Government has designated the following \"Municipios Tur\u00edsticos\": in Almer\u00eda, Roquetas de Mar; in C\u00e1diz, Chiclana de la Frontera, Chipiona, Conil de la Frontera, Grazalema, Rota, and Tarifa; in Granada, Almu\u00f1\u00e9car; in Huelva, Aracena; in Ja\u00e9n, Cazorla; in M\u00e1laga, Benalm\u00e1dena, Fuengirola, Nerja, Rinc\u00f3n de la Victoria, Ronda, and Torremolinos; in Seville, Santiponce.\n\n\n===== Monuments and features =====\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nThe unemployment rate stood at 25.5% in 2017 and was one of the highest in Spain and Europe.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nAs in any modern society, transport systems are an essential structural element of the functioning of Andalusia. The transportation network facilitates territorial coordination, economic development and distribution, and intercity transportation.In urban transport, underdeveloped public transport systems put pedestrian traffic and other non-motorized traffic are at a disadvantage compared to the use of private vehicles. Several Andalusian capitals\u2014C\u00f3rdoba, Granada and Seville\u2014have recently been trying to remedy this by strengthening their public transport systems and providing a better infrastructure for the use of bicycles. There are now three rapid transit systems operating in Andalucia \u2013 the Seville Metro, M\u00e1laga Metro and Granada Metro. Cercan\u00edas commuter rail networks operate in Seville, M\u00e1laga and C\u00e1diz.\n\nFor over a century, the conventional rail network has been centralized on the regional capital, Seville, and the national capital, Madrid; in general, there are no direct connections between provincial capitals. High-speed AVE trains run from Madrid via C\u00f3rdoba to Seville and M\u00e1laga, from which a branch from Antequera to Granada opened in 2019. Further AVE routes are under construction. The Madrid-C\u00f3rdoba-Seville route was the first high-velocity route in Spain (operating since 1992). Other principal routes are the one from Algeciras to Seville and from Almer\u00eda via Granada to Madrid.\nMost of the principal roads have been converted into limited access highways known as autov\u00edas. The Autov\u00eda del Este (Autov\u00eda A-4) runs from Madrid through the Despe\u00f1aperros Natural Park, then via Bail\u00e9n, C\u00f3rdoba, and Seville to C\u00e1diz, and is part of European route E05 in the International E-road network. The other main road in the region is the portion of European route E15, which runs as the Autovia del Mediterr\u00e1neo along the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Parts of this constitute the superhighway Autopista AP-7, while in other areas it is Autov\u00eda A-7. Both of these roads run generally east\u2013west, although the Autov\u00eda A-4 turns to the south in western Andalusia.\nOther first-order roads include the Autov\u00eda A-48 roughly along the Atlantic coast from C\u00e1diz to Algeciras, continuing European route E05 to meet up with European route E15; the Autov\u00eda del Quinto Centenario (Autov\u00eda A-49), which continues west from Seville (where the Autov\u00eda A-4 turns toward the south) and goes on to Huelva and into Portugal as European route E01; the Autov\u00eda Ruta de la Plata (Autov\u00eda A-66), European route E803, which roughly corresponds to the ancient Roman 'Silver Route' from the mines of northern Spain, and runs north from Seville; the Autov\u00eda de M\u00e1laga (Autov\u00eda A-45), which runs south from C\u00f3rdoba to M\u00e1laga; and the Autov\u00eda de Sierra Nevada (Autov\u00eda A-44), part of European route E902, which runs south from Ja\u00e9n to the Mediterranean coast at Motril.\n\nAs of 2008 Andalusia has six public airports, all of which can legally handle international flights; however the M\u00e1laga Airport is dominant, handling 60.67 percent of passengers and 85 percent of its international traffic. The Seville Airport handles another 20.12 percent of traffic, and the Jerez Airport 7.17 percent, so that these three airports account for 87.96 percent of traffic.M\u00e1laga Airport is the international airport that offers a wide variety of international destinations. It has a daily link with twenty cities in Spain and over a hundred cities in Europe (mainly in Great Britain, Central Europe and the Nordic countries but also the main cities of Eastern Europe: Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Sofia, Riga or Bucharest), North Africa, Middle East (Riyadh, Jeddah and Kuwait) and North America (New York, Toronto and Montreal).\n\nThe main ports are Algeciras (for freight and container traffic) and M\u00e1laga for cruise ships. Algeciras is Spain's leading commercial port, with 60,000,000 tonnes (66,000,000 short tons) of cargo in 2004. Seville has Spain's only commercial river port. Other significant commercial ports in Andalusia are the ports of the Bay of C\u00e1diz, Almer\u00eda and Huelva.\nThe Council of Government has approved a Plan of Infrastructures for the Sustainability of Transport in Andalusia (PISTA) 2007\u20132013, which plans an investment of 30 billion euros during that period.\n\n\n=== Energy infrastructure ===\nThe lack of high-quality fossil fuels in Andalusia has led to a strong dependency on petroleum imports. Still, Andalusia has a strong potential for the development of renewable energy, above all wind energy. The Andalusian Energy Agency established in 2005 by the autonomous government, is a new governmental organ charged with the development of energy policy and provision of a sufficient supply of energy for the community.The infrastructure for production of electricity consists of eight large thermal power stations, more than 70 hydroelectric power plants, two wind farms, and 14 major cogeneration facilities. Historically, the largest Andalusian business in this sector was the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Sevillana de Electricidad, founded in 1894, absorbed into Endesa in 1996.\n\nThe Solar power tower PS10 was built by the Andalusian firm Abengoa in Sanl\u00facar la Mayor in the province of Seville, and began operating in March 2007. It is the largest existing solar power facility in Europe. Smaller solar power stations, also recent, exist at C\u00fallar and Galera, Granada, inaugurated by Geosol and Caja Granada. Two more large thermosolar facilities, Andasol I y II, planned at Hoya de Guadix in the province of Granada are expected to supply electricity to half a million households. The Plataforma Solar de Almer\u00eda (PSA) in the Tabernas Desert is an important center for the exploration of the solar energy.The largest wind power firm in the region is the Sociedad E\u00f3lica de Andaluc\u00eda, formed by the merger of Planta E\u00f3lica del Sur S.A. and Energ\u00eda E\u00f3lica del Estrecho S.A.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nAs throughout Spain, basic education in Andalusia is free and compulsory. Students are required to complete ten years of schooling, and may not leave school before the age of 16, after which students may continue on to a baccalaureate, to intermediate vocational education, to intermediate-level schooling in arts and design, to intermediate sports studies, or to the working world.\nAndalusia has a tradition of higher education dating back to the Modern Age and the University of Granada, University of Baeza, and University of Osuna.\nAs of 2009, there are ten private or public universities in Andalucia. University studies are structured in cycles, awarding degrees based on ECTS credits in accord with the Bologna process, which the Andalusian universities are adopting in accord with the other universities of the European Higher Education Area.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n\nResponsibility for healthcare jurisdictions devolved from the Spanish government to Andalusia with the enactment of the Statute of Autonomy. Thus, the Andalusian Health Service (Servicio Andaluz de Salud) currently manages almost all public health resources of the Community, with such exceptions as health resources for prisoners and members of the military, which remain under central administration.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\nAccording to the Outreach Program for Science in Andalusia, Andalusia contributes 14 percent of Spain's scientific production behind only Madrid and Catalonia among the autonomous communities, even though regional investment in research and development (R&D) as a proportion of GDP is below the national average. The lack of research capacity in business and the low participation of the private sector in research has resulted in R&D taking place largely in the public sector.\nThe Council of Innovation, Science and Business is the organ of the autonomous government responsible for universities, research, technological development, industry, and energy. The council coordinates and initiates scientific and technical innovation through specialized centers an initiatives such as the Andalusian Center for Marine Science and Technology (Centro Andaluz de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda Marina) and Technological Corporation of Andalusia (Corporaci\u00f3n Tecnol\u00f3gica de Andaluc\u00eda).\nWithin the private sphere, although also promoted by public administration, technology parks have been established throughout the Community, such as the Technological Park of Andalucia (Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico de Andaluc\u00eda) in Campanillas on the outskirts of M\u00e1laga, and Cartuja 93 in Seville. Some of these parks specialize in specific sector, such as Aer\u00f3polis in aerospace or Geolit in food technology. The Andalusian government deployed 600,000 Ubuntu desktop computers in their schools.\n\n\n== Media ==\nAndalusia has international, national, regional, and local media organizations, which are active gathering and disseminating information (as well as creating and disseminating entertainment).\nThe most notable is the public Radio y Televisi\u00f3n de Andaluc\u00eda (RTVA), broadcasting on two regional television channels, Canal Sur and Canal Sur 2, four regional radio stations, Canal Sur Radio, Canal Fiesta Radio, Radio Andaluc\u00eda Informaci\u00f3n and Canal Flamenco Radio, as well as various digital signals, most notably Canal Sur Andaluc\u00eda available on cable TV throughout Spain.\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nDifferent newspapers are published for each Andalusian provincial capital, comarca, or important city. Often, the same newspaper organization publishes different local editions with much shared content, with different mastheads and different local coverage. There are also popular papers distributed without charge, again typically with local editions that share much of their content.\nNo single Andalusian newspaper is distributed throughout the region, not even with local editions. In eastern Andalusia the Diario Ideal has editions tailored for the provinces of Almer\u00eda, Granada, and Ja\u00e9n. Grupo Joly is based in Andalucia, backed by Andalusian capital, and publishes eight daily newspapers there. Efforts to create a newspaper for the entire autonomous region have not succeeded (the most recent as of 2009 was the Diario de Andaluc\u00eda). The national press (El Pa\u00eds, El Mundo, ABC, etc.) include sections or editions specific to Andalusia.\n\n\n=== Public television ===\n\nAndalusia has two public television stations, both operated by Radio y Televisi\u00f3n de Andaluc\u00eda (RTVA):\n\nCanal Sur first broadcast on 28 February 1989 (D\u00eda de Andaluc\u00eda).\nCanal Sur 2 first broadcast 5 June 1998. Programming focuses on culture, sports, and programs for children and youth.In addition, RTVA also operates the national and international cable channel Canal Sur Andaluc\u00eda, which first broadcast in 1996 as Andaluc\u00eda Televisi\u00f3n.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nThere are four public radio stations in the region, all operated by RTVA:\n\nCanal Sur Radio, first broadcast October 1988.\nRadio Andaluc\u00eda Informaci\u00f3n, first broadcast September 1998.\nCanal Fiesta Radio, first broadcast January 2001.\nCanal Flamenco Radio, first broadcast 29 September 2008.\n\n\n== Art and culture ==\n\nThe patrimony of Andalusia has been shaped by its particular history and geography, as well as its complex flows of population. Andalusia has been home to a succession of peoples and civilizations, many very different from one another, each impacting the settled inhabitants. The ancient Iberians were followed by Celts, Phoenicians and other Eastern Mediterranean traders, Romans, migrating Germanic tribes, Arabs or Berbers. All have shaped the Spanish patrimony in Andalusia, which was already diffused widely in the literary and pictorial genre of the costumbrismo andaluz.In the 19th century, Andalusian culture came to be widely viewed as the Spanish culture par excellence, in part thanks to the perceptions of romantic travellers. In the words of Ortega y Gasset:\n\nAndalusia, which has never shown the swagger nor petulancy of particularism; that has never pretended to the status of a State apart, is, of all the Spanish regions, the one that possesses a culture most radically its own. Throughout the 19th century, Spain has submitted itself to the hegemonic influence of Andalusia. That century began with the C\u00e1diz Cortes; it ended with the assassination of C\u00e1novas del Castillo, malague\u00f1o [from M\u00e1laga], and the exaltation of Silvela, no less malague\u00f1o. The dominant ideas have an Andalusian accent. One paints Andalusia: a roof-terrace, some flowerpots, blue sky. One reads southern authors. One speaks at all times of the \"land of the Most Holy Virgin Mary\". The thief from the Sierra Morena and the smuggler are national heroes. All Spain feels its existence justified by the honor of having on its flanks the Andalusian piece of the planet. Around 1900, like so many other things, this changes. The North sits up.\n\n\n=== Arts ===\n\nAndalusia has been the birthplace of many great artists: the classic painters Vel\u00e1zquez, Murillo, and Juan de Vald\u00e9s Leal; the sculptors Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s, Alonso Cano and Pedro de Mena; and such modern painters as Daniel V\u00e1zquez D\u00edaz and Pablo Picasso.\nThe Spanish composer Manuel de Falla was from C\u00e1diz and incorporated typical Andalusian melodies in his works, as did Joaqu\u00edn Turina, from Seville. The great singer Camar\u00f3n de la Isla was born in San Fernando, C\u00e1diz, and Andr\u00e9s Segovia who helped shape the romantic-modernist approach to classical guitar, was born in Linares, Ja\u00e9n. The virtuoso Flamenco guitar player Paco de Lucia who helped internationalize Flamenco, was born in Algeciras, Cadiz.\n\n\n==== Architecture ====\n\nSince the Neolithic era, Andalusia has preserved important megaliths, such as the dolmens at the Cueva de Menga and the Dolmen de Viera, both at Antequera. Archeologists have found Bronze Age cities at Los Millares and El Argar. Archeological digs at Do\u00f1a Blanca in El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda have revealed the oldest Phoenicians city in the Iberian peninsula; major ruins have also been revealed at Roman Italica near Seville.Some of the greatest architecture in Andalusia were developed across several centuries and civilizations. Such is the case of the Alhambra complex or the Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba.\n\nThe traditional architecture of Andalusia retains its Roman with added Persian and Egyptian influences brought by Arabs, with a marked Mediterranean character strongly conditioned by the climate. Traditional urban houses are constructed with shared walls to minimize exposure to high exterior temperatures. Solid exterior walls are painted with lime to minimize the heating effects of the sun. In accord with the climate and tradition of each area, the roofs may be terraces or tiled in the Roman imbrex and tegula style. One of the most characteristic elements (and one of the most obviously influenced by Roman architecture) is the interior patio or courtyard; the patios of C\u00f3rdoba are particularly famous. Other characteristic elements are decorative (and functional) wrought iron gratings and the tiles known as azulejos. Landscaping\u2014both for common private homes and homes on a more lavish scale\u2014also carries on older traditions, with plants, flowers, and fountains, pools, and streams of water. Beyond these general elements, there are also specific local architectural styles, such as the flat roofs, roofed chimneys, and radically extended balconies of the Alpujarra, the cave dwellings of Guadix and of Granada's Sacromonte, or the traditional architecture of the Marquisate of Zenete.\nThe monumental architecture of the centuries immediately after the Reconquista often displayed an assertion of Christian hegemony through architecture that referenced non-Arab influences. Some of the greatest Renaissance buildings in Andalusia are from the then-kingdom of Ja\u00e9n: the Ja\u00e9n Cathedral, designed in part by Andr\u00e9s de Vandelvira, served as a model for the Cathedral of Malaga and Guadix; the centers of \u00dabeda and Baeza, dating largely from this era, are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Seville and its kingdom also figured prominently in this era, as is shown by the Casa consistorial de Sevilla, the Hospital de las Cinco Llagas, or the Charterhouse of Jerez de la Frontera. The Palace of Charles V in Granada is uniquely important for its Italianate purism. Andalusia also has such Baroque-era buildings as the Palace of San Telmo in Seville (seat of the current autonomic presidency), the Church of Our Lady of Reposo in Campillos, and the Granada Charterhouse. Academicism gave the region the Royal Tobacco Factory in Seville and Neoclassicism the nucleus of C\u00e1diz, such as its city hall, Royal Prison, and the Oratorio de la Santa Cueva.Revivalist architecture in the 19th and 20th centuries contributed the buildings of the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 in Seville, including the Neo-Mud\u00e9jar Plaza de Espa\u00f1a. Andalusia also preserves an important industrial patrimony related to various economic activities.\nBesides the architecture of the cities, there is also much outstanding rural architecture: houses, as well as ranch and farm buildings and dog houses.\n\n\n==== Sculpture ====\n\nThe Iberian reliefs of Osuna, Lady of Baza, and Le\u00f3n de Bujalance, the Phoenician sarcophagi of C\u00e1diz, and the Roman sculptures of the Baetic cities such as Italica give evidence of traditions of sculpture in Andalusia dating back to antiquity. There are few significant surviving sculptures from the time of al-Andalus; two notable exceptions are the lions of the Alhambra and of the Marist\u00e1n of Granada (the Nasrid hospital in the Albaic\u00edn).\nThe Sevillian school of sculpture dating from the 13th century onward and the Granadan school beginning toward the end of the 16th century both focused primarily on Christian religious subject matter, including many wooden altarpieces. Notable sculptors in these traditions include Lorenzo Mercadante de Breta\u00f1a, Pedro Mill\u00e1n, Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s, Pedro Rold\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9 de Arce, Jer\u00f3nimo Balb\u00e1s, Alonso Cano, and Pedro de Mena.Non-religious sculpture has also existed in Andalusia since antiquity. A fine example from the Renaissance era is the decoration of the Casa de Pilatos in Seville. Nonetheless, non-religious sculpture played a relatively minor role until such 19th-century sculptors as Antonio Susillo.\n\n\n==== Painting ====\n\nAs in sculpture, there were Sevillian and the Granadan schools of painting. The former has figured prominently in the history of Spanish art since the 15th century and includes such important artists as Zurbar\u00e1n, Vel\u00e1zquez and Murillo, as well as theoreticians of art such as Francisco Pacheco. The Museum of Fine Arts of Seville and the Prado contain numerous representative works of the Sevillian school of painting.\nA specific romantic genre known as costumbrismo andaluz depicts traditional and folkloric Andalusian subjects, such as bullfighting scenes, dogs, and scenes from Andalusia's history. Important artists in this genre include Manuel Barr\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Ramos, Gonzalo Bilbao and Julio Romero de Torres. The genre is well represented in the private Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection, part of which is on display at Madrid's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and Carmen Thyssen Museum in M\u00e1laga.M\u00e1laga also has been and is an important artistic center. Its most illustrious representative was Pablo Picasso, one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. The city has a Museum and Natal House Foundation, dedicated to the painter.\n\n\n=== Literature and philosophy ===\n\nAndalusia plays a significant role in the history of Spanish-language literature, however not all of the important literature associated with Andalusia was written in Spanish. Before 1492, there was the literature written in Andalusian Arabic. Hispano-Arabic authors native to the region include Ibn Hazm, Ibn Zayd\u00fan, Ibn Tufail, Al-Mu'tamid, Ibn al-Khatib, Ibn al-Yayyab, and Ibn Zamrak or Andalusian Hebrew poets as Solomon ibn Gabirol. Ibn Quzman, of the 12th century, crafted poems in the colloquial Andalusian language.In 1492 Antonio de Nebrija published his celebrated Gram\u00e1tica de la lengua castellana (\"Grammar of the Castilian language\"), the first such work for a modern European language. In 1528 Francisco Delicado wrote La lozana andaluza, a novel in the orbit of La Celestina, and in 1599 the Sevillian Mateo Alem\u00e1n wrote the first part of Guzm\u00e1n de Alfarache, the first picaresque novel with a known author.\nThe prominent humanist literary school of Seville included such writers as Juan de Mal Lara, Fernando de Herrera, Gutierre de Cetina, Luis Barahona de Soto, Juan de la Cueva, Gonzalo Argote de Molina, and Rodrigo Caro. The Cordoban Luis de G\u00f3ngora was the greatest exponent of the culteranismo of Baroque poetry in the Siglo de Oro; indeed, the style is often referred to as G\u00f3ngorismo.\nLiterary Romanticism in Spain had one of its great centers in Andalusia, with such authors as \u00c1ngel de Saavedra, 3rd Duke of Rivas, Jos\u00e9 Cadalso and Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer. Costumbrismo andaluz existed in literature as much as in visual art, with notable examples being the Escenas andaluzas of Seraf\u00edn Est\u00e9banez Calder\u00f3n and the works of Pedro Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n.\nAndalusian authors \u00c1ngel Ganivet, Manuel G\u00f3mez-Moreno, Manuel and Antonio Machado, and Francisco Villaespesa are all generally counted in the Generation of '98. Also of this generation were the Quintero brothers, dramatists who faithfully captured Andalusian dialects and idiosyncrasies. Also of note, 1956 Nobel Prize-winning poet Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez was a native of Moguer, near Huelva.\n\nA large portion of the avant-garde Generation of '27 who gathered at the Ateneo de Sevilla on the 300th anniversary of G\u00f3ngora's death were Andalusians: Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Luis Cernuda, Rafael Alberti, Manuel Altolaguirre, Emilio Prados, and 1977 Nobel laureate Vicente Aleixandre.Certain Andalusian fictional characters have become universal archetypes: Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's gypsy Carmen, P. D. Eastman's Perro, Pierre Beaumarchais's F\u00edgaro, and Tirso de Molina's Don Juan.\nAs in most regions of Spain, the principal form of popular verse is the romance, although there are also strophes specific to Andalusia, such as the sole\u00e1 or the soleariya. Ballads, lullabies, street vendor's cries, nursery rhymes, and work songs are plentiful.\nAmong the philosophers native to the region can be counted Seneca, Avicebron, Maimonides, Averroes, Fern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Oliva, Sebasti\u00e1n Fox Morcillo, \u00c1ngel Ganivet, Francisco Giner de los R\u00edos and Mar\u00eda Zambrano.\n\n\n=== Music of Andalusia ===\n\nThe music of Andalusia includes traditional and contemporary music, folk and composed music, and ranges from flamenco to rock. Conversely, certain metric, melodic and harmonic characteristics are considered Andalusian even when written or performed by musicians from elsewhere.\nFlamenco, perhaps the most characteristically Andalusian genre of music and dance, originated in the 18th century, but is based in earlier forms from the region. The influence of the traditional music and dance of the Romani people or Gypsies is particularly clear. The genre embraces distinct vocal (cante flamenco), guitar (toque flamenco), and dance (baile flamenco) styles.The Andalusian Statute of Autonomy reflects the cultural importance of flamenco in its Articles 37.1.18 and 68:\n\nGuiding principles of public policy: 18th The preservation and enhancement of the cultural, historic and artistic heritage of Andalusia, especially flamenco.\nAlso within the Autonomous Community (of Andalucia) is the exclusive competence in knowledge, conservation, research, training, promotion and dissemination of flamenco as a unique element of the Andalusian cultural heritage.\n\nFundamental in the history of Andalusian music are the composers Crist\u00f3bal de Morales, Francisco Guerrero, Francisco Correa de Arauxo, Manuel Garc\u00eda, Manuel de Falla, Joaqu\u00edn Turina, and Manuel Castillo, as well as one of the fathers of modern classical guitar, the guitarist Andr\u00e9s Segovia. Mention should also be made of the great folk artists of the copla (music) and the cante hondo, such as Roc\u00edo Jurado, Lola Flores (La Faraona, \"the pharaoh\"), Juanito Valderrama and the revolutionary Camar\u00f3n de la Isla.Prominent Andalusian rock groups include Triana and Medina Azahara. The duo Los del R\u00edo from Dos Hermanas had international success with their \"Macarena\", including playing at a Super Bowl half-time show in the United States, where their song has also been used as campaign music by the Democratic Party. Other notables include the singer, songwriter, and poet Joaqu\u00edn Sabina, Isabel Pantoja, Rosa L\u00f3pez, who represented Spain at Eurovision in 2002, and David Bisbal.\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nThe portrayal of Andalusia in film is often reduced to archetypes: flamenco, bullfighting, Catholic pageantry, brigands, the property-rich and cash-poor se\u00f1orito andaluz and emigrants. These images particularly predominated from the 1920s through the 1960s, and helped to consolidate a cliched image of the region. In a very different vein, the province of Almer\u00eda was the filming location for many Westerns, especially (but by no means exclusively) the Italian-directed Spaghetti Westerns. During the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, this was the extent of the film industry in Andalusia.\nNonetheless, Andalusian film has roots as far back as Jos\u00e9 Val del Omar in the pre-Franco years, and since the Spanish transition to democracy has brought forth numerous nationally and internationally respected directors: Antonio Cuadri (Heart of the Earth), Chus Guti\u00e9rrez (Poniente), Chiqui Carabante (Carlos Against the World), Alberto Rodr\u00edguez (7 Virgins), Benito Zambrano (Solas), and Antonio Banderas (Summer Rain).\nCounting together feature films, documentaries, television programs, music videos etc., Andalusia has boomed from 37 projects shooting in 1999 to 1,054 in 2007, with the figure for 2007 including 19 feature films. Although feature films are the most prestigious, commercials and television are currently more economically important to the region.\nThe Filmoteca de Andaluc\u00eda, headquartered in C\u00f3rdoba, is a government-run entity in charge of the investigation, collection and diffusion of Andalusian cinematic heritage. Other important contributors to this last activity are such annual film festivals as the M\u00e1laga Film Festival (Festival de M\u00e1laga Cine Espa\u00f1ol (FMCE)), the most important festival dedicated exclusively to cinema made in Spain, the Seville Festival of European Film (SFCE), the International Festival of Short Films\u2014Almer\u00eda in Short, the Huelva Festival of Latin American Film, the Atlantic Film Show in C\u00e1diz, the Islantilla Festival of Film and Television and the African Film Festival of Tarifa.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\n\n\n==== Customs and society ====\n\nEach sub-region in Andalusia has its own unique customs that represent a fusion of Catholicism and local folklore. Cities like Almer\u00eda have been influenced historically by both Granada and Murcia in the use of traditional head coverings.  The sombrero de Labrador, a worker's hat made of black velvet, is a signature style of the region.\nIn C\u00e1diz, traditional costumes with rural origins are worn at bullfights and at parties on the large estates. The tablao flamenco dance and the accompanying cante jondo vocal style originated in Andalusia and traditionally most often performed by the gypsy Romani. One of the most distinctive cultural events in Andalusia is the Romer\u00eda de El Roc\u00edo in May. It consists of a pilgrimage to the Hermitage of El Roc\u00edo in the countryside near Almonte, in honor of the Virgin of El Roc\u00edo, an image of the Virgin and Child. In recent times the Romer\u00eda has attracted roughly a million pilgrims each year.In Ja\u00e9n, the saeta is a revered form of Spanish religious song, whose form and style has evolved over many centuries. Saetas evoke strong emotion and are sung most often during public processions. Verdiales, based upon the fandango, are a flamenco music style and song form originating in Almogia, near M\u00e1laga. For this reason, the Verdiales are sometimes known as Fandangos de M\u00e1laga. The region also has a rich musical tradition of flamenco songs, or palos called cartageneras. Seville celebrates Semana Santa, one of the better known religious events within Spain. During the festival, religious fraternities dress as penitents and carry large floats of lifelike wooden sculptures representing scenes of the Passion, and images of the Virgin Mary. Sevillanas, a type of old folk music sung and written in Seville and still very popular, are performed in fairs and festivals, along with an associated dance for the music, the Baile por sevillanas. All the different regions of Andalusia have developed their own distinctive customs, but all share a connectedness to Catholicism as developed during baroque Spain society.\n\n\n==== Andalusian Spanish ====\n\nAndalusian Spanish is one of the most widely spoken forms of Spanish in Spain, and because of emigration patterns was very influential on American Spanish. Rather than a single dialect, it is really a range of dialects sharing some common features; among these is the retention of more Arabic words than elsewhere in Spain, as well as some phonological differences compared with Standard Spanish. The isoglosses that mark the borders of Andalusian Spanish overlap to form a network of divergent boundaries, so there is no clear border for the linguistic region.\n\n\n==== Religion ====\n\nThe territory now known as Andalusia fell within the sphere of influence of ancient Mediterranean mythological beliefs. Phoenician colonization brought the cults of Baal and Melqart; the latter lasted into Roman times as Hercules, mythical founder of both C\u00e1diz and Seville. The Islote de Sancti Petri held the supposed tomb of Hercules, with representations of his Twelve labors; the region was the traditional site of the tenth labor, obtaining the cattle of the monster Geryon. Traditionally, the Pillars of Hercules flank the Strait of Gibraltar. Clearly, the European pillar is the Rock of Gibraltar; the African pillar was presumably either Monte Hacho in Ceuta or Jebel Musa in Morocco. The Roman road that led from C\u00e1diz to Rome was known by several names, one of them being Via Herculea, Hercules route returning from his tenth labor. The present coat of arms of Andalusia shows Hercules between two lions, with two pillars behind these figures.\nRoman Catholicism is, by far, the largest religion in Andalusia. In 2012, the proportion of Andalusians that identify themselves as Roman Catholic was 78.8%. The principal characteristic of the local popular form of Catholicism is devotion to the Virgin Mary; Andalusia is sometimes known as la tierra de Mar\u00eda Sant\u00edsima (\"the land of Most Holy Mary\"). Also characteristic are the processions during Holy Week, in which thousands of penitents (known as nazarenos) sing saetas. Andalusia is the site of such pilgrim destinations as the Santuario de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Cabeza in And\u00fajar and the Hermitage of El Roc\u00edo in Almonte.\n\n\n==== Bullfighting ====\n\nWhile some trace the lineage of the Spanish Fighting Bull back to Roman times, today's fighting bulls in the Iberian peninsula and in the former Spanish Empire trace back to Andalusia in the 15th and 16th centuries. Andalusia remains a center of bull-rearing and bullfighting: its 227 fincas de ganado where fighting bulls are raised cover 146,917 hectares (363,040 acres). In the year 2000, Andalusia's roughly 100 bullrings hosted 1,139 corridas.The oldest bullring still in use in Spain is the neoclassical Plaza de toros in Ronda, built in 1784. The Andalusian Autonomous Government sponsors the Rutas de Andaluc\u00eda taurina, a touristic route through the region centered on bullfighting.\n\n\n==== Festivals ====\n\nThe Andalusian festivals provide a showcase for popular arts and traditional costume. Among the most famous of these are the Seville Fair or Feria de Abril in Seville, now echoed by smaller fairs in Madrid and Barcelona, both of which have many Andalusian immigrants; the Feria de Agosto in M\u00e1laga; the Feria de Jerez or Feria del Caballo in Jerez; the Festival of Corpus Christi in Granada; the Feria de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Salud in C\u00f3rdoba; the Columbian Festivals (Fiestas Colombinas) in Huelva; the Feria de la Virgen del Mar in Almer\u00eda; and the Feria de San Lucas in Ja\u00e9n, among many others.\nFestivals of a religious nature are a deep Andalusian tradition and are met with great popular fervor. There are numerous major festivals during Holy Week. An annual pilgrimage brings a million visitors to the Hermitage of El Roc\u00edo in Almonte (population 16,914 in 2008); similarly large crowds visit the Santuario de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Cabeza in And\u00fajar every April.\nOther important festivals are the Carnival of C\u00e1diz and the Fiesta de las Cruces or Cruz de mayo in Granada and C\u00f3rdoba; in C\u00f3rdoba this is combined with a competition for among the patios (courtyards) of the city.\nAndalusia hosts an annual festival for the dance of flamenco in the summer-time.\n\n\n==== Cuisine ====\n\nThe Andalusian diet varies, especially between the coast and the interior, but in general is a Mediterranean diet based on olive oil, cereals, legumes, vegetables, fish, dried fruits and nuts, and meat; there is also a great tradition of drinking wine.Fried fish\u2014pesca\u00edto frito\u2014and seafood are common on the coast and also eaten well into the interior under coastal influence. Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) from the Almadraba areas of the Gulf of C\u00e1diz, prawns from Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda (known as langostino de Sanl\u00facar), and deepwater rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) from Huelva are all highly prized. Fishing for the transparent goby or chanquete (Aphia minuta), a once-popular small fish from M\u00e1laga, is now banned because the techniques used to catch them trap too many immature fish of other species.The mountainous regions of the Sierra Morena and Sierra Nevada produce cured hams, notably including jam\u00f3n serrano and jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico. These come from two different types of pig, (jam\u00f3n serrano from white pigs, the more expensive jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico from the Black Iberian pig). There are several denominaciones de origen, each with its own specifications including in just which microclimate region ham of a particular denomination must be cured. Plato alpujarre\u00f1o is another mountain specialty, a dish combining ham, sausage, sometimes other pork, egg, potatoes, and olive oil.\nConfectionery is popular in Andalusia. Almonds and honey are common ingredients. Many enclosed convents of nuns make and sell pastries, especially Christmas pastries: mantecados, polvorones, pesti\u00f1os, alfajores, yemas de San Leandro, as well as churros or tejeringos, meringue cookies (merengadas), and amarguillos.\nCereal-based dishes include migas de harina in eastern Andalusia (a similar dish to couscous rather than the fried breadcrumb based migas elsewhere in Spain) and a sweeter, more aromatic porridge called pole\u00e1 in western Andalusia.\nVegetables form the basis of such dishes as alboron\u00eda (similar to ratatouille) and the chopped salad known as pipirrana or piri\u00f1aca. Hot and cold soups based in olive oil, garlic, bread, tomato and peppers include gazpacho, salmorejo, porra antequerana, ajo caliente, sopa campera, or\u2014using almonds instead of tomato\u2014ajoblanco.Wine has a privileged place at the Andalusian table. Andalusian wines are known worldwide, especially fortified wines such as sherry (jerez), aged in soleras. These are enormously varied; for example, dry sherry may be the very distinct fino, manzanilla, amontillado, oloroso, or Palo Cortado and each of these varieties can each be sweetened with Pedro Xim\u00e9nez or Moscatel to produce a different variety of sweet sherry. Besides sherry, Andaluc\u00eda has five other denominaciones de origen for wine: D.O. Condado de Huelva, D.O. Manzanilla-Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, D.O. M\u00e1laga, D.O. Montilla-Moriles, and D.O. Sierras de M\u00e1laga. Most Andalusian wine comes from one of these regions, but there are other historic wines without a Protected Geographical Status, for example Tintilla de Rota, Pajarete, Moscatel de Chipiona and Mosto de Umbrete.\nAndalusia also produces D.O. vinegar and brandy: D.O. Vinagre de Jerez and D.O. Brandy de Jerez.\n\n\n==== Other traditions ====\n\nThe traditional dress of 18th-century Andalusia was strongly influenced by majismo within the context of casticismo (purism, traditionalism, authenticity). The archetype of the majo and maja was that of a bold, pure Spaniard from a lower-class background, somewhat flamboyant in his or her style of dress. This emulation of lower-class dress also extended to imitating the clothes of brigands and Romani (\"Gypsy\") women.\n\nThe Museum of Arts and Traditions of Sevilla  has collected representative samples of a great deal of the history of Andalusian dress, including examples of such notable types of hat as the sombrero cordob\u00e9s, sombrero cala\u00f1\u00e9s, sombrero de catite and the pavero, as well as the traje corto and traje de flamenca.\nAndalusia has a great artisan tradition in tile, leather (see Shell cordovan), weaving (especially of the heavy jarapa cloth), marquetry, and ceramics (especially in Ja\u00e9n, Granada, and Almer\u00eda), lace (especially Granada and Huelva), embroidery (in And\u00e9valo), ironwork, woodworking, and basketry in wicker, many of these traditions a heritage of the long period of Muslim rule.Andalusia is also known for its dogs, particularly the Andalusian Hound, which was originally bred in the region. Dogs, not just andalusian hounds, are very popular in the region.\nAndalusian equestrianism, institutionalized in the Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art is known well beyond the borders of Spain. The Andalusian horse is strongly built, compact yet elegant, distinguished in the area of dressage and show jumping, and is also an excellent horse for driving. They are known for their elegant \"dancing\" gait.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Team sports ===\n\nIn Andalusia, as throughout Spain, football is the predominant sport. Introduced to Spain by British men who worked in mining for Rio Tinto in the province of Huelva, the sport soon became popular with the local population. As Spain's oldest existing football club, Recreativo de Huelva, founded 1889, is known as El Decano (\"the Dean\").For the 2019/20 season, 3 Andalusian clubs will compete in Spain's First Division La Liga: Granada CF, Real Betis, and Sevilla FC. Betis won La Liga in 1934\u201335 and Sevilla in the 1945\u201346 season. The seven other Andalusian teams, C\u00e1diz CF, C\u00f3rdoba CF, UD Almer\u00eda and M\u00e1laga CF play in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, whilst Recreativo de Huelva, Spain's oldest club and Marbella FC participate in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, and Real Ja\u00e9n participates in the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n.\nThe Andalusia autonomous football team is not in any league, and plays only friendly matches. In recent years, they have played mostly during the Christmas break of the football leagues. They play mostly against national teams from other countries, but would not be eligible for international league play, where Spain is represented by a single national team.\nIn recent decades, basketball has become increasingly popular, with CB M\u00e1laga, also known as Unicaja M\u00e1laga who have won the Liga ACB in 2007 and the Kora\u0107 Cup in 2001 and usually play the Euroleague, CB Sevilla (Banca C\u00edvica) and CB Granada competing at the top level in the Liga ACB.Unlike basketball, handball has never really taken off in Andalusia. There is one Andalusian team in the Liga Asobal, Spain's premier handball league: BM Puente Genil, playing in the province of C\u00f3rdoba.\nAndalusia's strongest showing in sports has been in table tennis. There are two professional teams: Cajasur Priego TM and Caja Granada TM, the latter being Spain's leading table tennis team, with more than 20 league championships in nearly consecutive years and 14 consecutive Copas del Rey, dominating the Liga ENEB\u00c9. Cajasur is also one of the league's leading teams.\n\n\n=== Olympics ===\n\n220 Andalusian athletes have competed in a total of 16 summer or winter Olympic Games. The first was Leopoldo Sainz de la Maza, part of the silver-medal-winning polo team at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium.In all, Andalusians have won 6 gold medals, 11 silver, and 2 bronze. Winners of multiple medals include the Cordoban boxer Rafael Lozano (bronze in the 1996 Summer Olympics at Atlanta, Georgia, US, and silver in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia); sailor Theresa Zabell, Malague\u00f1a by adoption (gold medals at Barcelona in 1992 and Atlanta in 1996). Other notable winners have been Granadan tennis player Manuel Orantes (silver in the men's singles of the demonstration tournament in Mexico City in 1968), Jerezano riders Ignacio Rambla and Rafael Soto (silver in dressage in Athens in 2004) and the racewalker Paquillo Fern\u00e1ndez from Guadix (silver in Athens in 2004).\nThe largest number of Olympic appearances were by the Malague\u00f1a swimmer Mar\u00eda Pel\u00e1ez (five appearances), the Granadan skier Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Rienda (four), the Sevillian rider Luis Astolfi (four), and the Sevillian rower Fernando Climent (four, including a silver at Los Angeles, California, US, in 1984.Seville has been a pre-candidate to host the Summer Olympics in two occasions, 2004 and 2008, and Granada has been a pre-candidate to host the winter Olympics; neither has ever succeeded in its candidature. The ski resort of Sierra Nevada, near Granada, has however hosted the 1996 Alpine World Ski Championships, and Granada hosted the 2015 Winter Universiade.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nOther sporting events in Andalusia include surfing, kitesurfing and windsurfing competitions at Tarifa, various golf tournaments at courses along the coast, and horse racing and polo at several locations in the interior. Andalusia hosted the 1999 World Championships in Athletics (Seville), the 2005 Mediterranean Games (Almer\u00eda) and the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 (Granada), among other major events. There is also the annual Vuelta a Andaluc\u00eda bicycle road race and the Linares chess tournament.\n\n\n== Twinning and covenants ==\nAndalusia has had a sister region relationship with Buenos Aires (Argentina), since 2001; and with C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina). Also Andalusia has a collaboration agreement with Guerrero (Mexico).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAndalusian people\nAndalusian nationalism\nList of Andalusians\nRoman B\u00e9tica Route\nWhite Towns of Andalusia\nAzulejo\nYeseria\nList of the oldest mosques\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site \u2013 Junta de Andalucia\nAndalucia Tourism Site\nAndalucia page at the guardian",

          "The museum is on top of the Sacromonto hill, so not the easiest to reach, but so much worth the effort. There are a dozen or so caves which have been renovated. The caves show different sides of the gypsy life - cooking, weaving, iron works etc and it gives you a good idea of",
          "We highly recommend the caves museum. It\u2019s done nicely and you can clearly see how the gypsies lived. You get a 30 page folder in your language which guides you through the place. We liked it more than the Alhambra.",
          "This is a cute little museum in Granada. The walk to get there is up a big hill! The museum has a series of small caves with displays set up in each. Nice things to look at and read the info posted outside each cave. It's pretty small. Walk all the way to the end of the",

          "It\u2019s quite a hike up to the museum especially with a small child and buggy! But it is well worth the effort. The museum gives a very good impression of how life would have been for those who lived in the cave houses. As an extra bonus you get fabulous views of Alhambra Palace.",
          "The museum is small but really charming and unusual. I do not really understand why some reviews said the museum is questionable as a tourist trap. Absolutely it's not. I saw a short authentic film with gitanos who lived there ( issued in 1962) played, cooked, did metal work",

          "We were not expecting to learn so much about the gypsies of the Sacramonte here, but we did. The way they gave us information about each part of the their life's was done very well. The museum was easy to find using the C2 bus from Plaza Nueva and asking the bus to let us know",
          "The museum is difficult to find - we walked from the Albaycin along winding roads without much in the way of pavements and after seeing the cave dwellings and flamenco cafes we found a sign and followed the directions - upwards. It was some way off the road and you have to keep",
          "What a hidden gem! It doesn't seem like a lot of people know about this musuem. When we were there, there was only one other family there and we really had the whole place to ourselves. The Museo Cuevas del Sacromonte isn't like your typical museum. It is more of a living",

          "A small, silly museum hardly worth 5 euro admission or opportunity cost of visiting more significant cultural and historical sites around the city. The displays are a complete hodgepodge and not informative about the size and development of \u2026",
          "Very interesting place! Amazing cave apartments, workshops and even cave toilets. Opportunity to discover interesting part of Spanish culture without crowds of tourists. All this neighborhood Sacromonte is also suitable for pedestrian walks.",
          "This is worth the little hike. Fullest respect to the effort put in to maintain the place. Interesting history. Entry is \u20ac5. Worthy!",
          "Really interesting. Brilliant view of Alhambra, a little bit of a trek but worth it.",
          "This is a place you definitely must visit if you come to Granada. The museum tells you the story of the cave dwellings that are scattered all over the Sacromonte. There are caves to be seen, as well as living conditions, artefacts and \u2026",
          "Interesting place, you will learn a lot about the local history as well there is a good view of Alhambra from that area.",
          "It was good, but I feel like I have seen better.  The C34 bus will take you up there, but i thought it was just as easy to walk instead of wait on the bus.",
          "Very informative and relaxing place. You need to do some hiking to reach it.",
          "A very cute museum which provides information in excellent English. Great views of the Alhambra and Granada!",
          "A wonderful museum with lots of fascinating cultural history and incredible views",
          "If you can make it up to the hill it worth it. For 5euro you have the chance to see some really well preserved caves and learn a lot for the history of the area.  There is also a small cafe and wonderful views to the city.",
          "An interesting open air museum of life inside the caves.",
          "Nice look into cave life and cave houses. Beautiful views as well. Really friendly staff.",
          "The museum has several caves with recreations of gypsy dwellings and associated working structures.   Gives you info on how they lived.  There's also some flamenco historical info, and info on the flora and fauna of that hillside.  Quite \u2026",
          "Interesting little museum. Good to visit if you are already visited all the stuff in Granada. No audio-guide but a brochure with all the explanations.",
          "You should walk up to this quiet place to receive information of the gipsies's life in Sacramonte and the beginning of the Flamenco in these caves.",
          "Great way to learn about how Gypsies used to live.",
          "Fantastic opportunity to peak into the past of Granada and the way some of its inhabitants lived until the early seventies. Also a nice brief review of the birth and history of flamenco. As a bonus, in order to reach this museum you get a \u2026",
          "Very, VERY steep to get there, but worth it.  Very interesting & great views.",
          "Loved it here, interesting and great views of the Alhambra",
          "A beautiful place with a nice museum explaining the life in caves and a phantastic view on the Alhambra. Absolutely worth visiting...",
          "An interesting journey on foot from the city centre of Granada to this place. A sort of an uphill climb and during a hot summer afternoon can be quite challenging. Once there one can enjoy the cave dwellings of gypsies which are a few and could be made more interesting with live shows etc. Not many people were there when I visited.",
          "Interesting place! A old fashioned museum, just a I liked. Information about the nature of the enviremont and other caven in the world, but not so much information about the gypsies that used to live here.",
          "Marvellous experience.  Fascinating insight into the past.  Very cheap entrance fees.",
          "Spectacular views and the Caves are well presented.",

          "Amazing views amazing place to go during summer especially for movies! :)",
          "Nice place to learn about cave houses, Flamenco and gypsies. First couple of caves are nice recreations of home and working places, around the corner there is interesting information on cave homes, Flamenco and Sacramento history. I think \u2026",
          "Fascinating history and way of life. Well presented and also offers stunning views of La Alhambra.",
          "Just go and enjoy no one can describe the beauty of this place",
          "Great original Flamenco live, awesome views",
          "Small but nice. If you are on vista on Alhambra this is close from you. Entrance is 5\u20ac and you can buy cold drinks there as well. The first few caves are nice. Gipsy life and natural life of this place is well presented here. Nice look on Alhambra here also",
          "I would very much recommend the open-air cinema up there in summer, with usually really good independent movies (Tuesdays and Thursdays at 22h, 3,50\u20ac entrance, language Spanish) or live-music on Wednesdays and Fridays (22h, 6,-\u20ac entrance, \u2026",
          "We did a guided tour and it was totally worth it. Lots of interesting information about gipsies and Granada.",
          "Really interesting little museum set in the caves. I walked through the squatted caves area over the back of the church on the hill which was like nowhere I\u2019ve ever seen! Wished I\u2019d worn my blundstones as the paths are rough. Amazing views over Mountains and deep into the valley.",
          "The best place to know about the gypsy old houses and as well their flamenco culture. Don't miss it.",
          "Don't waste your time to go there. Nothing special to see.",
          "Wonderful museum focused on the cave buildings people used to live in. Very cheap and a fun place to visit. It is quite a bit of a climb to get there, but the mirador (viewpoint) as well as the museum is totally worth it. Awesome view of the well known Alhambra and the rest of the city of Granada.",
          "Interesting history, cordial staff. Learned a great deal about gypsies and their culture. Colorful and great views. Self guided tours. Not an easy walk for people with physical limitations. Even the walk from bus stop to museum has many steps.",
          "What a lovely place up in the hills with such delightful little cave homes cut into the hillside.  Completely authentic and well worth a visit.  My children really loved the mini furniture and wondered at how the caves were so cool.",
          "It's on like a big hill, so if you are planning on walking there, bring water. Or try to get a taxi to drop you off as close as it can to the museum. I would high recommend check this place out.",
          "it just same as other buildings in area..there is no need museum here..just climbed to see this museum however there was nothing interesting inside..beside they take 5 euro for ticket to see same caves around..money and time waste",
          "Excellent little museum on cave living but also flamenvo history",
          "It is ok. 6 caves and set up like how gypsies used to live in them. Be ready for steep climb and 5 Euro fees.",
          "Cute little museum on a beautiful spot, nice view on the Alhambra too. A little too expensive (\u20ac5) for what it is though, no discounts either. Half of the price would be more appropriate. Popular with school groups. It\u2019s located on quite a steep hill .",
          "Worth the walk to see a fascinating insight into local life over the last century.",
          "I found this such an interesting place to learn about original gypsy life here in Spain. The museum well conserved, and has info cards that explain everything you need to know. It costs \u20ac5 pp, but I think its worth it.",

          "Cool insight into the cave homes and how people lived",
          "Interesting little museum that is a series of caves, each with a unique them. Some insight into an ancient micro culture.",
          "Delicious food and friendly staff",
          "Kind of a wonky little museum, but gives ample information about how the have-not ling gypsies lived. Also has a great viewpoint of Granada and Alhambra. Cheap entrance price, but the hike up is quite long.",
          "It was a neat little place with interesting history. Several small caves display the various tools and home goods used by the gypsies who used to inhabit the area. There were signs written in both Spanish and English explaining the history \u2026",
          "Nice to see, but it gives an impression that it is there only for turists.",
          "Weird little museum in folk life. A bit of a walk out. Worth a visit for \u20ac5.",
          "Very quiet in middle of afternoon. Well thought out exhibit with excellent views over sacromonte and Granada. For 5 euros worth a shot after a long climb up steep hills",

          "Small but interesting museum focusing on the local ecosystem and the lives of the local gypsies centuries ago. Worth a visit for sure, but beware: access only via a long and steep path with many steps.",
          "Interesting museum, worth a visit and great views",
          "Interesting museum. Guided visit was a little rushed, but we'll worth it.",
          "Unusual and very interesting! Definitely worth a visit - also for the spectacular view of the Alhambra! Needs a little TLC.",
          "Nice place to learn about flamenco, moros and gypsis history and have a great view from Granada.",
          "Small but comprehensive look into the history of living in caves, small cafe. Fee to enter 5 euro, brochures offered in various languages, do ask",
          "One October afternoon I explored the area around the museum and was impressed with the view of the city, the nearby Alhambra and the outlying mountains. From what I recall I was trekking towards a nearby cathedral, following the melodies of \u2026",
          "Fun and informative, nice staff and amazing view! Worth the \u20ac5 visit if you're already up the hill.",

          "Expectacular",
          "Well kept museum , But the grounds are real small , doesn't seem to be any original exhibits but rather reconstructed. \nAdmission at 5 eur is pretty high. \nOn the plus side great walk there through the Sacromonte district and great views of the Alhambra ",

          "It's small but you can find it best place to study cave culture of the world.",

          "Interesting view of another way of life. Some wonderful photos.",
          "Well worth the climb!",
          "It's quite a small, simple place. But to see the caves where gypsies lived I think it's worth paying 5 euros. ",
          "The information isnt very specific about this place in particular, the signs which were meant to explain the site seem to be very generic. The entry fee  is 5 euros, which isnt very expensive. Come only if you have spare time in granada",
          "Amazing outdoor museum with informative explanations in Spanish and English.",
          "Not so impresive compared to a lot of better places to visit in Granada. Entrance of 5 Euro reasonable.",

          "Expectaculares!",
          "Good experience of the cave dwellers, however it seems that the caves have been altered (tiled floors, painted walls and electrified) so it would be difficult to understand how exactly the caves looked like earlier.",
          "Nice but not very teaching",
          "Beautiful views but not worth the price in my opinion. It's a very steep climb as well.",
          "Nice insight into the gitano tradition in Granada and its links to flamenco. Some of the analyses could be more hard hitting re socio-economic and historical reasons which led to the growth of sacromonte area.",

          "An interesting piece of history. You can go into caves and see different old items.",

        "wiki": "Bogot\u00e1 (, also UK: , US: , Spanish: [bo\u0263o\u02c8ta] (listen)), officially Bogot\u00e1, Distrito Capital, abbreviated Bogot\u00e1, D.C., and formerly known as Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1 between 1991 and 2000, is the capital and largest city of Colombia, administered as the Capital District, as well as the capital of the department of Cundinamarca. Bogot\u00e1 is a territorial entity of the first order, with the same administrative status as the departments of Colombia. It is the political, economic, administrative and industrial center of the country.\nBogot\u00e1 was founded as the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada on 6 August 1538, by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada after a harsh expedition into the Andes conquering the Muisca. The Muisca were the indigenous inhabitants of the region, and they called the place of the foundation \"Thybzaca\" or \"Old Town\". The name of Bogot\u00e1 corresponds to the Spanish pronunciation of the Chibcha Bacat\u00e1 (or Mueket\u00e1) which was the name of a neighboring settlement located between the modern towns of Funza and Cota. There are different opinions about the meaning of the word Bacat\u00e1, the most accepted being that it means \"walling of the farmland\" in the Chibcha language. Another popular translation argues that it means \"The Lady of the Andes\". Further, the word 'Andes' in the Aymara language means \"shining mountain\", thus rendering the full lexical signification of Bogot\u00e1 as \"The Lady of the shining mountain\" (notice, however, that the language of the Muisca people was not Aymara but Chibcha). Others suggest that Bacat\u00e1 was the name of the Muisca cacique who governed the land before the Spaniards arrived. Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada gave the settlement the name of \"Our Lady of Hope\" but the Spanish crown gave it the name of Santaf\u00e9 (Holy Faith) in 1540 when it was appointed as a city.Santaf\u00e9 became the seat of the government of the Spanish Royal Audiencia of the New Kingdom of Granada (created in 1550), and then after 1717 it was the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. After the Battle of Boyac\u00e1 on 7 August 1819, Bogot\u00e1 became the capital of the independent nation of Gran Colombia. It was Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar who rebaptized the city with the name of Bogot\u00e1, as a way of honoring the Muisca people and as an emancipation act towards the Spanish crown. Hence, since the Viceroyalty of New Granada's independence from the Spanish Empire and during the formation of present-day Colombia, Bogot\u00e1 has remained the capital of this territory.\nThe city is located in the center of Colombia, on a high plateau known as the Bogot\u00e1 savanna, part of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense located in the Eastern Cordillera of the Andes. It is the third-highest capital in South America and in the world after Quito and La Paz, at an average of 2,640 metres (8,660 ft) above sea level. Subdivided into 20 localities, Bogot\u00e1 has an area of 1,587 square kilometres (613 square miles) and a relatively cool climate that is constant through the year.\nThe city is home to central offices of the executive branch (Office of the President), the legislative branch (Congress of Colombia) and the judicial branch (Supreme Court of Justice, Constitutional Court, Council of State and the Superior Council of Judicature) of the Colombian government. Bogot\u00e1 stands out for its economic strength and associated financial maturity, its attractiveness to global companies and the quality of human capital. It is the financial and commercial heart of Colombia, with the most business activity of any city in the country. The capital hosts the main financial market in Colombia and the Andean natural region, and is the leading destination for new foreign direct investment projects coming into Latin America and Colombia. It has the highest nominal GDP in the country, responsible for almost a quarter of the nation's total (24.7%).\nThe city's airport, El Dorado International Airport, named after the mythical El Dorado, handles the largest cargo volume in Latin America, and is third in number of people. Bogot\u00e1 is home to the largest number of universities and research centers in the country, and is an important cultural center, with many theaters, libraries and museums. Bogot\u00e1 ranks 52nd on the Global Cities Index 2014, and is considered a global city type \"Alpha \u2212\" by GaWC.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe area of modern Bogot\u00e1 was first populated by groups of indigenous people who migrated south based on the relation with the other Chibcha languages; the Bogot\u00e1 savanna was the southernmost Chibcha-speaking group that exists from Nicaragua to the Andes in Colombia. The civilisation built by the Muisca, who settled in the valleys and fertile highlands of and surrounding the Altiplano Cundiboyacense (modern-day departments of Cundinamarca and Boyac\u00e1 and small parts of Santander), was one of the great civilisations in the Americas. The name Muisca Confederation has been given to a loose egalitarian society of various chiefs (caciques) who lived in small settlements of maximum 100 boh\u00edos. The agriculture and salt-based society of the people was rich in goldworking, trade and mummification. The religion of the Muisca consisted of various gods, mostly related to natural phenomena as the Sun (Su\u00e9) and his wife, the Moon; Ch\u00eda, rain Chibchacum, rainbow Cuchavira and with building and feasting (Nencatacoa) and wisdom (Bochica). Their complex luni-solar calendar, deciphered by Manuel Izquierdo based on work by Duquesne, followed three different sets of years, where the sidereal and synodic months were represented. Their astronomical knowledge is represented in one of the few extant landmarks of the architecture of the Muisca in El Infiernito outside Villa de Leyva to the north of Bogot\u00e1.\n\n\n=== Pre-Columbian era ===\n\nThe first populations inhabiting the present-day Metropolitan Area of Bogot\u00e1 were hunter-gatherer people in the late Pleistocene. The oldest dated evidence thus far has been discovered in El Abra (12,500 BP), north of Zipaquir\u00e1. Slightly later dated excavations in a rock shelter southwest of the city in Soacha provided ages of ~11,000 BP; Tequendama. Since around 0 AD, the Muisca domesticated guinea pigs, part of their meat diet. The people inhabiting the Bogot\u00e1 savanna in the late 15th century were the Muisca, speaking Muysccubun, a member of the Chibcha language family. Muisca means \"people\" or \"person\", making \"Muisca people\", how they are called, a tautology. At the arrival of the conquerors, the population was estimated to be half a million indigenous people on the Bogot\u00e1 savanna of up to two million in the Muisca Confederation. They occupied the highland and mild climate flanks between the Sumapaz Mountains to the southwest and Cocuy's snowy peak to the northeast, covering an approximate area of 25,000 km2 (9,653 sq mi), comprising Bogot\u00e1's high plain, the current Boyac\u00e1 department portion and a small Santander region.\nTrade was the most important activity of the Muisca with other Chibcha-speaking neighbours, such as the Guane, Lache and U'wa and with Cariban groups as the Muzo or \"Emerald People\". Their knowledge of salt production from brines, a task exclusively for the Muisca women, gave them the name \"Salt People\". Tropical fruits that didn't grow on the cool highlands, coca, cotton and gold were traded at markets that took place every Muisca week; every four days. At these frequent markets, the Muisca obtained various luxury goods that seem worthless in modern sense and precious metals and gemstones that seem valuable to us became abundant and used for various purposes. The Muisca warrior elite was allowed to wear feathered crowns, from parrots and macacs whose habitat was to the east of the Andes; the Arawkan-speaking Guayupe, Tegua and Achagua.\nThe Muisca cuisine consisted of a stable and varied diet of tubers, potatoes and fruits. Maize was the main ingredient of the Muisca, cultivated on elevated and irrigated terraces. In Muysccubun exist many words for maize, corn and the various types and forms of it. The product was also the base for chicha; the alcoholic beverage of the people, still sold in central Bogot\u00e1 today. It was the drink for construction of houses, celebrations of harvests and sowing, ritual practices around the various sacred sites of the Altiplano, music and dances, trade at special ferias with farther away trading indigenous groups of Colombia and to inaugurate the new highest regarded member of the community; zipas, zaques, caciques and the religious ruler iraca from Sacred City of the Sun Sugamuxi.\n\n\n=== Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada expedition and Spanish conquest ===\n\nFrom 1533, a belief persisted that the R\u00edo Grande de la Magdalena was the trail to the South Sea, to Per\u00fa, legendary El Dorado. Such was the target of Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada, the Granadanian conquistador who left Santa Marta on 6 April 1536 with 800 soldiers, heading towards the interior of current Colombia. The expedition divided into two groups, one under Quesada's command to move on land, and the other commanded by Diego de Urbino would go up river in four brigantine ships to, later on, meet Quesada troops at the site named Tora de las Barrancas Bermejas. When they arrived, they heard news about Indians inhabiting the south and making large salt cakes used to trade for wild cotton and fish. Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada decided to abandon the route to Peru and cross the mountain in search of salt villages. They saw crops, trails, white salt cakes and then huts where they found corn, yucca and beans. From Tora, the expedition went up the Op\u00f3n River and found indigenous people wearing very finely painted cotton mantles. When they arrived in Muisca territories in the Andean Plateau, on 9 March 1537, of the expedition leaving Santa Marta, only 162 men were left.The zipa at the moment of Spanish conquest was Tisquesusa. His main boh\u00edo was in a small village called Bacat\u00e1 with others in Funza and Cajic\u00e1, giving name to the present day capital of Colombia. Bacat\u00e1 was actually located near to the modern location of the city of Funza. A prophecy in his life came true; he would be dying, bathing in his own blood. Defending Funza with a reduced army of guecha warriors against the heavily exhausted but heavily armed strangers, his reign fell in the hands of Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada and his younger brother Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez on 20 April 1537. Upon his death, his brother Sagipa became the last zipa, against the inheritance tradition of the Muisca. Sagipa used to be a main captain for Tisquesusa but quickly submitted to the Spanish rulers. The first encomenderos asked high prices in valuable products and agricultural production from the indigenous people. On top of that epidemics of European viruses razed through the population, of which in current Boyac\u00e1 65\u201385 % of the Muisca were killed within 100 years.Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada decided to establish a military campament in the area in 1538, in the site today known as the Chorro de Quevedo square. The foundation was performed by the construction of 12 houses of reed, referring to the Twelve Apostles, and the construction of a preliminary church, also of reed. With the celebration of the first mass in the campament, celebrated by Dominican friar Domingo de las Casas the city was founded with the name of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Esperanza (Our Lady of Hope) on 6 August 1538. Quesada placed his right foot on the bare earth and said simply, \"I take possession of this land in the name of the most sovereign emperor, Charles V.\"\nThis founding, however, was irregular as no town council was formed nor were town officials appointed, as well as lacking some other juridical requirements for an official founding. As a consequence, the official founding only occurred about eight months later, on 27 April 1539, in a site close to one of the recreational lands of the zipa, called Theusa or Theusaquillo. This official founding involved an official ceremony appointing a council and officials, and the demarcation of streets and lands, and in it fellow conquistadores Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar and Nikolaus Federmann were present. While this was the official date of founding, traditionally it is the 6 August 1538 that is considered the date of the actual foundation.\nThe village obtained the title of City by way of a decree from Charles V on 27 July 1540, which changed the name of the city from Our Lady of Hope to Santa Fe (Holy Faith), after the name of a town nearby Granada where Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada grew up. Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada and conquerors De Belalc\u00e1zar and Federmann left for Spain in April 1539, founding Guataqu\u00ed together on 6 April 1539. The rule over the newly created New Kingdom of Granada was left to Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada's brother, Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Quesada. The first mayors of the city were capitains Pedro de Arevalo y Jeronimo de Inzar. The city obtained the Title of Muy Noble y Muy Leal (Very Noble and Loyal) on 17 August 1575 by a decree from Phillip II. Bogot\u00e1, then called Santa Fe, later became the capital of the later Viceroyalty of New Granada. Following the independence from Spain, Bogot\u00e1 became capital of Gran Colombia and later the capital of the Republic of Colombia.\n\n\n=== Spanish colonization ===\nThe city mayor and the chapter formed by two councilmen, assisted by the constable and the police chief, governed the city. For better administration of these domains, in April 1550, the Audiencia of Santaf\u00e9 was organized. Santa Fe (or Santaf\u00e9) became the seat of the government of the New Kingdom of Granada . Fourteen years later in 1564, the Spanish Crown designated the first Royal Audiencia chairman, Andr\u00e9s D\u00edaz Venero de Leyva. The Chapter and the Royal Audience were located on the other side of what is today the Plaza de Bol\u00edvar (then called, Plaza Mayor or Major Square). The street connecting the Major Square and the Square of Herbs\u2014 now Santander Park\u2014 was named Calle Real (Royal Street), now Carrera S\u00e9ptima (or \"Seventh Street\"; counted from the mountains to the east of the city). After 1717 Santaf\u00e9 became the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada.\nFormed by Europeans, mestizos, indigenous people, and slaves, from the second half of the 16th century, the population began to grow rapidly. The 1789 census recorded 18,161 inhabitants, and by 1819 the city population reached 30,000 inhabitants distributed in 195 blocks. Importance grew when the Diocese was established.\n\n\n=== Nineteenth century ===\n\nPolitical unease over the Spanish monarchy and the rights of citizens born in the Americas had been feeling all over Spanish colonies in America, and it was expressed in New Granada in many different ways, accelerating the movement to independence. One of the most transcendent was the Insurrection of the Comuneros, a riot by the locals that started in Villa del Socorro \u2014current Department of Santander\u2014in March 1781. Spanish authorities suppressed the riot, and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gal\u00e1n, the leader, was executed. He left an imprint, though. One of the soldiers witnessing his execution was an intellectually curious, noble teenager named Antonio Nari\u00f1o, who was deeply impressed by both the insurrection and the execution. Nari\u00f1o went on to become a politician in Santaf\u00e9, and he became acquainted with the liberal ideas in vogue in Europe. He started organizing clandestine meetings with other intellectuals and politicians to discuss and promote the independence of the American colonies from the Spanish crown. In 1794, Nari\u00f1o clandestinely translated and published in Santa Fe the Declaration of the Rights of Men and of the Citizen, and copies of his translation were distributed all over the continent and started creating a stirring in the political mentalities of the time. The Spanish government had banned the distribution of the pamphlet and soon discovered the material and burned any copy that they could find. Nari\u00f1o was arrested on 29 August 1794, and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and to have all of his properties confiscated, and was sent to exile the year after. Those suspected of being part of Nari\u00f1o's intellectual circle were also persecuted, but his ideas had become widespread.In 1807, following the French invasion of Spain and the subsequent abdication of the House of Bourbon in Spain, pressed by Napoleon to give the crown to his brother Joseph, resulting in the destruction of the Spanish administration, many in Spain and in the American colonies created local resistance governments called Juntas. The dissolution of the Supreme Central Junta, following a series of military defeats in the Spanish troops promoted the creation of local juntas all throughout Latin America, which very soon consolidated the independentist ideas already in vogue. After the establishment of a junta in Cartagena de Indias on 22 May 1810, and in many other cities throughout the Viceroyalty, the Junta de Santa Fe was established in 20 July 1810, in what is often called the Colombian Declaration of Independence. The Junta adopted the name of \"Supreme Junta of the New Kingdom of Granada\", and first swore allegiance to Viceroy Antonio Jos\u00e9 Amar y Borb\u00f3n, and appointed him as president, but then he was deposed and arrested five days later. After declaring independence from Spain the different juntas attempted to establish a congress of provinces, but they were unable to do so and military conflicts soon emerged.\nThe period between 1810 and 1816 was marked by intense conflict between federalist and centralist factions over the nature of the new government of the recently emancipated juntas, a period that has become known as la Patria Boba. The Province of Santaf\u00e9 became the Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca, which soon became embroiled in a civil war against other of the local juntas which banded together to form the United Provinces of New Granada and advocated for a federalist government system. Following a failed military campaign against Quito, General Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar of the United Provinces led a campaign that led to the surrender of the Cundinamarca province in December 1814.\nIn Spain, the war had ended and the Spanish monarchy was restored on 11 December 1813. King Ferdinand VII of Spain declared the uprisings in the colonies illegal and sent a large army to quell the rebellions and reconquer the lost colonies, for which he appointed General Pablo Morillo. Morillo led a successful military campaign that culminated in the capture of Santaf\u00e9 on 6 May 1816.\nIn 1819, Bol\u00edvar initiated his campaign to liberate New Granada. Following a series of battles, the last of which was the Battle of Boyac\u00e1, the republican army led by Bol\u00edvar cleared its way to Santaf\u00e9, where he arrived victorious on 10 August 1819. It was Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar who rebaptized the city with the name of Bogot\u00e1, to honor the Muisca people and to emphasize the emancipation from Spain. Bogot\u00e1 then became the capital of the Gran Colombia.\nBetween 1819 and 1849, there were no fundamental structural changes from the colonial period. By the mid-19th century, a series of fundamental reforms were enacted, some of the most important being slavery abolition and religious, teaching, print and speech industry and trade freedom, among others. During the decade of the 70s, radicalism accelerated reforms and state and social institutions were substantially modified. However, during the second half of the century, the country faced permanent pronouncements, declarations of rebellions between states, and factions which resulted in civil wars: the last and bloodiest was the Thousand Days' War from 1899 to 1902.In 1823, a few years after the formation of Gran Colombia, the Public Library, now the National Library, was enlarged and modernized with new volumes and better facilities. The National Museum was founded. Those institutions were of great importance to the new republic's cultural development.  The Central University was the first State school, precursor of the current National University, founded in 1867 and domiciled in Bogot\u00e1.\n\n\n=== Regeneration ===\nPresident Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez declared the end of Federalism, and in 1886 the country became a centralist republic ruled by the constitution in force \u2013 save some amendments \u2013 up to 1981. In the middle of political and administration avatars, Bogot\u00e1 continued as the capital and principal political center of the country.\nFrom a base of only 20,000 people in 1793, the city grew to approximately 117,000 people in 1912. Population growth was rapid after 1870, largely because of emigration from the eastern highlands.\n\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nEarly in the 20th century, Colombia had to face devastating consequences from the One Thousand Days War, which lasted from 1899 to 1902, and the loss of Panama. Between 1904 and 1909, the lawfulness of the liberal party was re-established and President Rafael Reyes endeavored to implement a national government. Peace and state reorganization generated the increase of economic activities. Bogot\u00e1 started deep architectural and urban transformation with significant industrial and artisan production increases. In 1910, the Industrial Exposition of the Century took place at Park of Independence. Stands built evidenced industrial, artisan work, beaux arts, electricity and machinery progress achieved. The period from 1910 to 1930 is designated conservative hegemony. Between 1924 and 1928, hard union struggles began, with oil fields and banana zone workers' strikes, leaving numerous people dead.Bogot\u00e1 had practically no industry. Production was basically artisan work grouped in specific places, similar to commercial sectors. Plaza de Bol\u00edvar and surroundings lodged hat stores, at Calle del Comercio \u2013current Carrera Seventh\u2013 and Calle Flori\u00e1n \u2013now Carrera Eight\u2013 luxurious stores selling imported products opened their doors; at Pasaje Hern\u00e1ndez, tailor's shops provided their services, and between 1870 and 1883, four main banks opened their doors: Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, Popular and Mortgage Credit banks.\n\nFollowing the banana zone killings and conservative party division, Enrique Olaya Herrera took office in 1930. The liberal party reformed during 16 years of the so-called Liberal Republic, agricultural, social, political, labor, educational, economic and administrative sectors. Unionism strengthened and education coverage expanded.The celebration produced a large number of infrastructure works, new construction and work sources. Following the 1946 liberal party division, a conservative candidate took presidential office again in 1948, after the killing of liberal leader Jorge Eli\u00e9cer Gait\u00e1n, Bogot\u00e1's downtown was virtually destroyed as violence reigned. From then, Bogot\u00e1's urban, architectural and population sectors were substantially reorganized.\n\n\n=== Twenty-first century ===\n\nThe city begins the 21st century with important changes in its urban space and public transport, looking to plan a demographic and economic growth that would position it as a strategic hub for international business in Latin America. Some of the main interventions initiated in this century looked to develop projects contained in the Plan of Territorial Ordering (POT), which will guide the development of the city for the next two centuries.\nOne of the most important interventions in the city for this time was its transportation system. In 1967, there were 2,679 urban buses in Bogot\u00e1 that transported, on average, 1,629,254 passengers per day. The city had a little more than a million inhabitants and 8,000 hectares in length, the service was relatively reasonable and comfortable. But as the city grew and reached more than five million inhabitants and an area greater than 30,000 hectares, not only did the car fleet increase substantially to reach more than 20,000 vehicles, but chaos multiplied, as well as pollution and the inefficiency of the only existing transportation system.\nBy the end of the 20th century, the situation was critical. There was no real urban public transport system that would serve as an alternative to the private vehicle - which further incentivized its use - and the city had low levels of competitiveness in Latin America, as well as an unsatisfactory quality of life for the vast majority of its inhabitants.\nThe administrations of mayors Andr\u00e9s Pastrana (1988-1990) and Jaime Castro (1992-1994), in addition to the first one of Antanas Mockus (1995 - 1997), formulated proposals to solve the problem of public transport, with limited results. It was during the mayoralty of the latter when there was an insistent talk about the possibility of establishing a mass transportation system that would help remedy the problem of mobility in Bogot\u00e1.\nUnder the second administration of Antanas Mockus , Bogota opened a 'zone of tolerancia' which legalized prostitution in a large swath  of the center of the city in the Santa Fe neighborhood.Mayor Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa (1998-2000) included in his government program as a priority project a solution to the problem of public transport. Consequently, in the execution of the development plan \"For the Bogot\u00e1 we Want\" in terms of mobility and in a concrete way to the massive transportation system project, the construction of a special infrastructure exclusively for its operation was determined. This system would include specialized bus corridors, equipped with single-use lanes, stations, bridges, bike paths and special pedestrian access platforms, designed to facilitate the user's experience in the system. However, Pe\u00f1alosa was became infamous for this campaign against the poor, saying he would rather see robbers on the streets rather than people selling candies.\nAfter getting elected in 2011, Gustavo Petro, a populist mayor, clashed with conservative political establishment after remunicipalization of the city's garbage collection system. The inspector general, Alejandro Ordo\u00f1ez deposed Petro  for alleged constitutional overreach and when he tried to replace the city's private trash collectors. Petro was reinstated weeks later after a Bogota court ruled that the Alejandro Ordo\u00f1ez had overstepped his authority.\nAlthough the proposal for biarticulated diesel buses called \"Transmilenio\" was in its early stages a success, due in part to the small numbers of passengers that it transported, in the long term it became an inefficient and contaminating system, saturated for a metro population of almost ten million inhabitants, guilty of environmental deterioration and air pollution.\n\nFor its part, the cultural equipment plan of Bogot\u00e1 has given as one of its most significant results the construction of three large public libraries in different sectors of the city, in addition to the provision of existing ones. The new libraries were located in sectors that allow a wide coverage, have easy access by public transport and bike paths; and their projects were commissioned to distinguished architects of the city. They are those of El Tunal, in the south, projected by the architect Suely Vargas of El Tintal, in the west, the work of the architect Daniel Berm\u00fadez, and the Virgilio Barco Vargas library, located in the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar park in the central area, work of the architect Rogelio Salmona. The three libraries, in addition to their excellent architecture, offer spaces for the educational and cultural development of the citizens of Bogota.As for 2019, the city's distribution is composed of nine main business centers (Av. El Dorado Business Corridor, Centro Internacional, Parque de la 93, El Lago, North Point, Calle 100, Santa Barbara Business Center, Zona Industrial Montevideo & Parque Industrial Zona Franca). Grittier sides sit south and southwest, where working-class barrios continue to battle their reputations for drugs and crime. In the ritzier north you'll find boutique hotels, corporate offices and well-heeled locals piling into chic entertainment districts such as the Zona Rosa and Zona G.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBogot\u00e1 is located in the southeastern part of the Bogot\u00e1 savanna (Sabana de Bogot\u00e1) at an average altitude of 2,640 metres (8,660 ft) above sea level. The Bogot\u00e1 savanna is popularly called \"savannah\" (sabana), but constitutes actually a high plateau in the Andes mountains, part of an extended region known as the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, which literally means \"high plateau of Cundinamarca and Boyac\u00e1\". Bogot\u00e1 is the largest city in the world at its elevation; there is no urban area that is both higher and more populous than Bogot\u00e1.\nIn the extreme south of Bogota's District, the world's largest continuous paramo ecosystem can be found; Sumapaz P\u00e1ramo in the locality Sumapaz.The Bogot\u00e1 River running NE-SW crosses the sabana, forming Tequendama Falls (Salto del Tequendama) to the south. Tributary rivers form valleys with flourishing villages, whose economy is based on agriculture, livestock raising and artisanal production.The sabana is bordered to the east by the Eastern Cordillera of the Andes mountain range. The Eastern Hills, which limit city growth, run from south to north, and form east of the center the Guadalupe and Monserrate mountains. The western city limit is the Bogot\u00e1 River. The Sumapaz Paramo (moorland) borders the south and to the north Bogot\u00e1 extends over the plateau up to the towns of Ch\u00eda and Sop\u00f3.\nMost of the wetlands in the Bogota region have disappeared. They covered nearly 50,000 hectares in the 1960s, compared to only 727 in 2019, for a disappearance rate of 98%.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nBogot\u00e1 has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfb) bordering on a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb). The average temperature is 14.5 \u00b0C (58 \u00b0F), varying from 6 to 19 \u00b0C (43 to 66 \u00b0F) on sunny days to 10 to 18 \u00b0C (50 to 64 \u00b0F) on rainy days. Dry and rainy seasons alternate throughout the year. The driest months are December, January, July and August. The warmest month is March, bringing a maximum of 19.7 \u00b0C (67.5 \u00b0F). The coolest nights occur in January, with an average of 7.6 \u00b0C (45.7 \u00b0F) in the city; fog is very usual in early morning, 220 days per year, whilst clear sky sunny full days are quite unusual.The official highest temperature recorded within the city limits is 30.0 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and the lowest temperature recorded is \u22127.1 \u00b0C (19 \u00b0F), both at the Guaymaral Airport.The rainiest months are April, May, September, October, and November, in which typical days are mostly overcast, with low clouds and some winds, bringing maximum temperatures of 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) and lows of 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F).\nBecause of its low latitude and high altitude, Bogot\u00e1 has an average of 12 daylight hours and 11+ ultraviolet radiation year-round.\n\n\n=== Urban layout and nomenclature ===\n\nBogot\u00e1 has 20 localities, or districts, forming an extensive network of neighborhoods. Areas of higher economic status tend to be located in the north, close to the Eastern Hills in the districts of Chapinero, Usaqu\u00e9n and the east of Suba. The lower middle class inhabit the central, western and northwestern parts of the city.. The working-class neighborhoods are located in the south, some of them squatter areas.The urban layout in the center of the city is based on the focal point of a square or plaza, typical of Spanish-founded settlements, but the layout gradually becomes more modern in outlying neighborhoods. The types of roads are classified as Calles (streets), which run from west to east horizontally, with street numbers increasing towards the north, and also towards the south (with the suffix \"Sur\") from Calle 0 down south. Carreras (roads) run from north to south vertically, with numbering increasing from east to west. (with the suffix \"Este\" for roads east of Carrera 0). At the southeast of the city, the addresses are logically sur-este. Other types of roads more common in newer parts of the city may be termed Eje (Axis), Diagonal or Transversal.\nThe numbering system for street addresses recently changed, and numbers are assigned according to street rank from main avenues to smaller avenues and local streets. Some of Bogot\u00e1's main roads, which also go by a proper name in addition to a number, are:\n\nNorte-Quito-Sur or NQS (North Quito South Avenue, from 9th Rd at north following railway to 30th Rd, or Quito City Avenue, and Southern Highway)\nAutopista Norte-Avenida Caracas (Northern Highway, or 45th Rd, joined to Caracas Avenue, or 14th Rd)\nAvenida Circunvalar (or 1st Rd)\nAvenida Suba (60th transversal from 100th St the Suba Hills; 145th St from Suba Hills westward)\nAvenida El Dorado (El Dorado Avenue, or 26th St)\nAvenida de las Am\u00e9ricas (Avenue of the Americas, from 34th street at east to 6th street at west)\nAvenida Primero de Mayo (May First Avenue, or 22nd St South)\nAvenida Ciudad de Cali (Cali City Avenue, or 86th Rd)\nAvenida Boyac\u00e1 (Boyac\u00e1 Avenue, or 72nd Rd)\nAutopista Sur (Southern Highway)\n\n\n=== Localities (districts) ===\n\n\n=== Surrounding towns ===\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe largest and most populous city in Colombia, Bogot\u00e1 had 7,412,566 inhabitants within the city's limits (2018 census), with a population density of approximately 4,310 inhabitants per square kilometer. Only 25,166 people are located in rural areas of Capital District. 47.8% of the population are male and 52.2% women.\n\nIn Bogot\u00e1, as in the rest of the country, urbanization has accelerated due to industrialization as well as complex political and social reasons such as poverty and violence, which led to migration from rural to urban areas throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. A dramatic example of this is the number of displaced people who have arrived in Bogot\u00e1 due to the internal armed conflict.Some estimates show that Bogot\u00e1's floating population may be as high as 4 million people, most of them being migrant workers from other departments and displaced people. The majority of the displaced population lives in the Ciudad Bol\u00edvar, Kennedy, Usme, and Bosa sections.\n\n\n=== Ethnic Groups ===\n\nThe ethnic composition of the city's population includes minorities of Afro-Colombian people (0.9%), and Indigenous Amerindians (0.3%); 98.8% of the population has no ethnic affiliation, but are mestizos and whites.The native population of Bogota (bogotanos), is composed of two large groups: rolos and cachacos, the first being descendants of people who are not native to Bogota and the second, children of bogotanos.\nIn Bogot\u00e1, the accelerated urbanization process is not exclusively due to industrialization, since there are complex political and social reasons such as poverty and violence, which have motivated migration from the countryside to the city throughout the 20th century, determining an exponential growth of the population in Bogot\u00e1 and the establishment of misery belts in its surroundings. According to the Consultancy for Human Rights, Codhes, in the period 1999-2005 more than 260,000 displaced persons arrived in Bogot\u00e1, approximately 3.8% of the total population of Bogot\u00e1. The locations where the majority of the displaced population is concentrated are Ciudad Bolivar, Kennedy, Bosa and Usme. For this reason, the children of the migrant population born in Bogot\u00e1 (rolos) often do not have a sense of belonging to the city or a cultural identity as marked as that of the cachacos. However, due to the growing acculturation of rolos and the decreasing number of ethnic cachacos in Bogot\u00e1, the  population of rolos tends to be predominant in the city\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nBogot\u00e1 has gone to great lengths to change its formerly notorious crime rate and its image with increasing success after being considered in the 1990s to be one of the most violent cities in the world. In 1993 there were 4,352 murders at a rate of 81 per 100,000 people; in 2007 Bogot\u00e1 suffered 1,401 murders at a rate of 20 per 100,000 inhabitants, and had a further reduction to 14 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017 (the lowest since 1979). This success was mainly the result of a participatory and integrated security policy; \"Comunidad Segura\", that was first adopted in 1995 and continues to be enforced. 1.2 percent of street addresses account for 99 percent of homicides.\n\n\n== Government ==\nBogot\u00e1 is the capital of the Republic of Colombia, and houses the Congress, Supreme Court of Justice and the center of the executive administration as well as the residence of the President (Casa de Nari\u00f1o). These buildings, along with the Office of the Mayor, the Lievano Palace (Palacio Li\u00e9vano), are located within a few meters from each other on the Bol\u00edvar Square (Plaza de Bol\u00edvar). The square is located in the city's historical center, La Candelaria, which features architecture in Spanish Colonial and Spanish Baroque styles.\nThe Mayor of Bogot\u00e1 and the City Council \u2013 both elected by popular vote \u2013 are responsible for city administration. In 2019 Claudia L\u00f3pez was elected Mayor; her term runs from 2020 to 2023.\nThe city is divided into 20 localities: Usaqu\u00e9n, Chapinero, Santa Fe, San Crist\u00f3bal, Usme, Tunjuelito, Bosa, Kennedy, Fontib\u00f3n, Engativ\u00e1, Suba, Barrios Unidos, Teusaquillo, Los M\u00e1rtires, Antonio Nari\u00f1o, Puente Aranda, La Candelaria, Rafael Uribe Uribe, Ciudad Bol\u00edvar and Sumapaz.\nEach of the 20 localities is governed by an administrative board elected by popular vote, made up of no fewer than seven members. The Mayor designates local mayors from candidates nominated by the respective administrative board.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBogot\u00e1 is the main economic and industrial center of Colombia.\nThe Colombian government fosters the import of capital goods, Bogot\u00e1 being one of the main destinations of these imports.\nIn 2016 the World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC) from the United Kingdom ranked Bogot\u00e1 as an Alpha\u2212World City in the World Cities Study Group's inventory, a high-ranking. Alpha and Alpha- cities are important world cities that link major economic regions into the world economy.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nTravel & Tourism's share of the city's overall GDP stands at 2.5%. Bogot\u00e1 is responsible for 56% of the tourism that arrives to Colombia and is home 1,423 multinational companies. Bogot\u00e1 also ranked highly as a global city where business is done and meetings are held. Bogot\u00e1 is a growing international meetings destination.During the last year, Bogot\u00e1 has won 50 major international events, with 12 more world-class events in progress. The 16th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates took place from 2 to 5 February 2017 in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. One Young World is the preeminent global forum for young leaders aged 18\u201330. Bogot\u00e1, Colombia is the host city for Summit 2017.\n\nThe hotels in the historical center of La Candelaria and its surrounding areas cater to lovers of culture and the arts. This area also has the bulk of hostels in the city as well. In La Candelaria, there are many museums, including the Botero Museum and the Gold Museum. Close to La Candelaria is the Cerro Monserrate, which you can reach by cable car or funicular. The hotels located near Ciudad Salitre are intended for visitors who make short stops in Bogot\u00e1 and near El Dorado International Airport.\nImportant landmarks and tourist stops in Bogot\u00e1 include the botanical garden Jos\u00e9 Celestino Mutis, the Quinta de Bol\u00edvar, the national observatory, the planetarium, Maloka, the Colpatria observation point, the observation point of La Calera, the monument of the American flags, and La Candelaria (the historical district of the city). There is also Usaquen, a colonial landmark where brunch and flea market on Sundays is a traditional activity. The city has numerous green parks and amusement parks like Salitre Magico or Mundo Aventura.\nGreen areas surrounding Bogota are perfect locations for eco-tourism and hiking activities, in the eastern mountains of the city, just a few minutes walking from main roads, there are Quebrada La vieja and Chapinero Waterfalls, two of many green spots for sightseeing and tourism with clean air.There are also several areas of the city where fine restaurants can be found. The G Zone, the T Zone, and La Macarena are well known for their gastronomic offerings.Since the 2000s, major hotel chains have established in the city. Bogota has a great cultural diversity, coming from different regions of the country, which allows the tourist to know the multiculturalism of the country without the need to travel to other cities, this includes gastronomy and different festivals.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Shopping malls ===\n\nBogot\u00e1's economy has been significantly boosted due to new shopping malls built within the last few years. As of December 2011, over 160 new malls are planned in addition to the existing 100 malls. Notable malls include:\n\nCentro Andino\nCentro Mayor\nSantaf\u00e9\nGran Estaci\u00f3n\nPortal de la 80\nTit\u00e1n Plaza\nCalima\nAtlantis Plaza\nUnicentro\nHayuelos\n\n\n== Media ==\nBogota is home to several television stations like Canal Capital and Citytv which are local stations, Canal 13 is a regional station, and is home to the national channels Caracol TV, RCN TV, Canal Uno, Canal Institucional, and Se\u00f1al Colombia. It has multiple satellite television services like Telef\u00f3nica, Claro and DirecTV and several satellite dishes which offer hundreds of international channels, plus several exclusive channels for Bogot\u00e1.\nIn Bogota, all the major radio networks in the country are available, in both AM and FM; 70% of the FM stations offer RDS service.\nThere are several newspapers, including El Tiempo, El Espectador and El Nuevo Siglo, plus economical dailies La Rep\u00fablica and Portafolio, tabloids El Espacio, Q'Hubo, and Extra. Bogot\u00e1 also offers three free newspapers, two Spanish, ADN and Publimetro, and one English, The Bogota Post.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\nEnergy and sewer bills are stratified based on the location of owner's residence, The system is the classification of the residential properties that should receive public services. Although the system does not consider the income per person and the rules say that the residential real estate should stratify and not households. All mayors should do the stratification of residential properties of their municipality or district.Bogot\u00e1's social strata have been divided as follows and have been extensively used by the government as a reference to develop social welfare programs, statistical information and to some degree for the assignment of lands.\n\nEstrato 1 (lowest)\nEstrato 2 (low)\nEstrato 3 (mid-low)\nEstrato 4 (mid-high)\nEstrato 5 (high)\nEstrato 6 (highest)\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nBogot\u00e1's growth has placed a strain on its roads and highways, but since 1998 significant efforts to upgrade the infrastructure have been undertaken. Private car ownership forms a major part of the congestion, in addition to taxis, buses and commercial vehicles. Buses remain the main means of mass transit. There are two bus systems: the traditional system and the TransMilenio.\nThe traditional system runs a variety of bus types, operated by several companies on normal streets and avenues: Bus (large buses), Buseta (medium size buses) and Colectivo (vans or minivans). The bigger buses were divided into two categories: Ejecutivo, which was originally to be a deluxe service and was not to carry standing passengers, and corriente or normal service. Since May 2008, all buses run as corriente services. Bogot\u00e1 is a hub for domestic and international bus routes. The Bogot\u00e1 terminal serves routes to most cities and towns in Colombia and is the largest in the country. There is international service to Ecuador, Per\u00fa and Venezuela.\nThe TransMilenio system was created during Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa's mayoral term, and is a form of bus rapid transit that has been deployed as a measure to compensate for the lack of a subway or rail system. TransMilenio combines articulated buses that operate on dedicated bus roads (busways) and smaller buses (feeders) that operate in residential areas, bringing passengers to the main grid. TransMilenio's main routes are: Caracas Avenue, Northern Highway (Autopista Norte), 80th Street, Americas Avenue, Jim\u00e9nez Avenue, and 30th Avenue (also referred to as Norte Quito Sur or N.Q.S. for short). Routes for Suba Avenue and Southern Highway (Autopista Sur), the southern leg of the 30th Avenue, were opened in April 2006. The third phase of the system will cover 7th Avenue, 10th Avenue, and 26th Street (or Avenida El Dorado). The system is planned to cover the entire city by 2030. Although the Transmilenio carries commuters to numerous corners of the city, it is more expensive (US$0.80 or 2300 COP) than any public transport, except taxis.\nIn addition to TransMilenio, the Pe\u00f1alosa administration and voter-approved referenda helped to establish travel restrictions on cars with certain license plate numbers during peak hours called Pico y placa; 121 kilometres (75 miles) of Ciclov\u00eda on Sundays and major holidays; a massive system (376 km (234 mi) as of 2013) of bicycle paths and segregated lanes called ciclorrutas; and the removal of thousands of parking spots in an attempt to make roads more pedestrian-friendly and discourage car use. Ciclorrutas is one of the most extensive dedicated bike path networks of any city in the world, with a total extension of 376 kilometres (234 miles). It extends from the north of the city, 170th Street, to the south, 27th Street, and from Monserrate on the east to the Bogot\u00e1 River on the west. The ciclorruta was started by the 1995\u20131998 Antanas Mockus administration with a few kilometers, and considerably extended afterwards with the development of a Bicycle Master Plan and the addition of paths hundreds of kilometers in extent. Since the construction of the ciclorruta bicycle use in the city has increased, and a car free week was introduced in 2014.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nBogot\u00e1's main airport is El Dorado International Airport, with an approximate area of 6.9 km2 (2.7 sq mi) located west of the city's downtown in the Fontib\u00f3n Locality. It is the third most important airport in Latin America after Mexico City International Airport and S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport and it is the most important airport in Colombia. Construction of the airport was ordered by Gustavo Rojas Pinilla (19th President of Colombia) in 1955 to replace the Aeropuerto de Techo. Due to its central location in Colombia and in Latin America, it is a hub for Colombia's Flagship Carrier Avianca, Copa Airlines Colombia and LATAM Colombia. It is also serviced by a number of international airlines including American, Delta, United, Air France, KLM, Turkish Airlines, Jet Blue, and Lufthansa. The national airport has begun to take more responsibility due to the congestion at the international airport. In response to the high demand of approximately 27 Million passengers per year, a new airport, El Dorado II, is planned to be built by 2021, to help alleviate traffic at the main airport.A secondary airport, CATAM, serves as a base for Military and Police Aviation. This airport, which uses the runways of El Dorado will eventually move to Madrid, a nearby town in the region of Cundinamarca, leaving further space to expand El Dorado.Guaymaral Airport is another small airport located in the northern boundaries of Bogota. It is used mainly for private aviation activities.\n\n\n=== Urban and suburban railways ===\n\nBogot\u00e1 has little railway transit infrastructure, following the collapse of the tram network, although a number of plans hope to change that. The Bogot\u00e1 Metro has been pushed forward by two successive governments, and proponents hope that construction will soon begin. Plans to construct railways in and out of the city, replacing defunct routes, have been delayed due to the pressing need for transport within the city. A tram train line using right-of-way from the defunct Bogot\u00e1 Savannah Railway, known as RegioTram, will be opening in 2023.\n\n\n=== Bicycle infrastructure ===\n\nBogot\u00e1 is the Colombian city with the most extensive and comprehensive network of bike paths. Bogot\u00e1's bike paths network or Ciclorutas de Bogot\u00e1 in Spanish, designed and built during the administration of Mayors Antanas Mockus and Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa, is also one of the most extensive in the world and the most extensive in Latin America. The network is integrated with the TransMilenio bus system which has bicycle parking facilities.\nBogota implemented a healthy habit called \"Ciclovia\" where principal highways are closed from 7:00 a.m. until 2:00 pm on Sundays and public holidays; therefore, the People ride their bikes to enjoy the city as well as exercise. In the same way just on December the same activity is carried out in the night, there are some special activities such as fireworks, street theater performances, and street food just to mention a few.\nSince 4 April 2016 the carrera 11 has been reduced from four to three car lanes and a new bike lane (cicloruta) has been inaugurated.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\nOn 25 December 1884, the first tramway pulled by mules was inaugurated and covered the route from Plaza de Bol\u00edvar to Chapinero, and in 1892, the line connecting Plaza de Bol\u00edvar and La Sabana Station started operating. The tramway ran over wooden rails and was easily derailed, so steel rails imported from England were eventually installed. In 1894, a tramway car ran the Bogot\u00e1\u2013Chapinero line every 20 minutes. The tram system eventually grew to cover most of the city and its surrounding suburbs. But during the Bogotazo riots of 1948, the system suffered heavy damage and was forced to close. The economic effects of the subsequent civil war that followed prevented the damage from being repaired. Parts of the system continued to operate in a reduced state until 1951, when they were replaced by buses. Most of the streetcar tracks were eventually paved over, but exposed tracks can still be seen on many of the older roads of the city, especially downtown and in the La Candelaria area, although it has been about 70 years since any vehicles have run on them.\n\n\n=== Bogota public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bogota, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 97 min. 32% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 20 min, while 40% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8 km, while 16% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nKnown as the Athens of South America, Bogot\u00e1 has an extensive educational system of both primary and secondary schools and colleges. Due to the constant migration of people into the nation's capital, the availability of quotas for access to education offered by the State free of charge is often insufficient. The city also has a diverse system of colleges and private schools.\nThere are a number of universities, both public and private. In 2002, there were a total of 113 higher education institutions; in Bogot\u00e1 there are several universities, most partially or fully accredited by the NAC (National Accreditation Council): National University of Colombia, University of the Andes, Colombia, District University of Bogot\u00e1, La Salle University, Colombia, University of La Sabana, Pontifical Xavierian University, Our Lady of the Rosary University, Universidad Externado de Colombia, Military University Nueva Granada, Central University, Colombia, University of America, Sergio Arboleda University, Jorge Tadeo Lozano University, Pilot University of Colombia, Catholic University of Colombia, Saint Thomas Aquinas University and Universidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional.\nThe city has a University City at the National University of Colombia campus located in the traditional sector Teusaquillo. It is the largest campus in Colombia and one of the largest in Latin America.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBogot\u00e1 has many cultural venues including 58 museums, 62 art galleries, 33 library networks, 45 stage theaters, 75 sports and attraction parks, and over 150 national monuments. Many of these are renowned globally such as:\nThe Luis \u00c1ngel Arango Library, the most important in the region which receives well over 6 million visitors a year;\nThe Colombian National Museum, one of the oldest in the Americas, dating back to 1823;\nThe Ibero-American Theater Festival, largest of its kind in the world, receives 2 million attendees enjoying over 450 performances across theaters and off the street;\nThe Bogot\u00e1 Philharmonic is the most important symphony orchestra in Colombia, with over 100 musicians and 140 performances a year. The city has been a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the category of music since March 2012.The Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n Theater, the country's oldest Opera House, opened in 1892. It is home to the National Symphony Association's major act, the National Symphony Orchestra of Colombia.Rock al Parque or Rock at the Park is an open air rock music festival. Recurring annually, it gathers over 320,000 music fans who can enjoy over 60 band performances for free during three days a year. The series have been so successful during its 15 years of operation that the city has replicated the initiative for other music genres, resulting in other recent festivals like Salsa at the Park, Hip Hop at the Park, Ballet at the Park, Opera at the Park, and Jazz at the Park.\nKids' Choice Awards Colombia, are the most important awards given in the city by Nickelodeon and the first ceremony was given in 2014 by the singer Maluma and in Corferias the ceremony has been the home of shows given by artists like Austin Mahone, Carlos Pe\u00f1a, Don Tetto and Riva among others.\nBogot\u00e1 has worked in recent years to position itself as leader in cultural offerings in South America, and it is increasingly being recognized worldwide as a hub in the region for the development of the arts.\nIn 2007, Bogot\u00e1 was awarded the title of Cultural Capital of Ibero-America by the UCCI (Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities), and it became the only city to have received the recognition twice, after being awarded for the first time in 1991.\n\n\n=== Cultural history ===\nBogot\u00e1 gave the Spanish-speaking world Jos\u00e9 Asunci\u00f3n Silva (1865\u20131896), Modernism pioneer. His poetic work in the novel De sobremesa has a place in outstanding American literature. Rafael Pombo (1833\u20131912) was an American romanticism poet who left a collection of fables essential part of children imagination and Colombian tradition.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe urban morphology and typology of colonial buildings in Bogot\u00e1 have been maintained since the late nineteenth century, long after the independence of Colombia (1810). This persistence of the colonial setting is still visible, particularly in La Candelaria, the historical center of Bogot\u00e1. Also kept up are the colonial houses of two stories, with courtyards, gabled roofs, ceramic tiles and balconies. In some cases, these balconies were enclosed with glass windows during the Republican period, a distinguishing feature of the architecture of the sector (for example, the House of Rafael Pombo).\"Republican Architecture\" was the style that prevailed between 1830 and 1930. Although there were attempts to consolidate a modern architectural language, the only examples seen are University City and White City at the National University of Colombia (constructed 1936 to 1939). This work was developed by German architect Leopold Rother, although architects of rationalist trends participated in the design of campus buildings. We also see in Bogotan architecture trends such as art deco, expressionism and organic architecture. This last trend was typified by Bogotan architects in the second half of the twentieth century such as Rogelio Salmona.\nIn 2015 BD Bacat\u00e1 was inaugurated, surpassing the Colpatria Tower to become the tallest building of the city and of Colombia. The building its expected to be the beginning of the city's downtown renovation.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Libraries and archives ===\nIn 2007 Bogot\u00e1 was named World Book Capital by UNESCO. Bogot\u00e1 is the first Latin American city to receive this recognition, and the second one in the Americas after Montreal. It stood out in programs, the library network and the presence of organizations that, in a coordinated manner, are working to promote books and reading in the city. Several specific initiatives for the World Book Capital program have been undertaken with the commitment of groups, both public and private, engaged in the book sector.\nThe city is home to the Biblored, an institution which administers 16 small and four large public libraries (Biblioteca Virgilio Barco, Biblioteca El Tintal, Biblioteca El Tunal and Biblioteca Julio Mario Santodomingo). It also has six branches of the Library Network of the Family Compensation Fund Colsubsidio and libraries and documentation centers attached to institutions like the Museo Nacional de Colombia (specializing in old books, catalogs and art), Museum of Modern Art, the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise, and the Centro Colombo Americano.\nAnother set of libraries are the new collaborative initiatives between the state, city and international agencies. Examples are the Cultural Center Gabriel Garc\u00eda Marquez, custom designed by the Fondo de Cultura Economica in Mexico, and the Spanish Cultural Center, which will begin construction with public funds and of the Spanish government in downtown Bogot\u00e1.The National Library of Colombia (1777), a dependence of the Ministry of Culture and the Biblioteca Luis Angel Arango (1958), a dependence of the Bank of the Republic are the two largest public libraries in the city. The first is the repository of more than two million volumes, with an important collection of ancient books. The latter has almost two million volumes, and with 45,000 m2 (480,000 sq ft) in size, it hosts 10,000 visitors a day; the Library Alfonso Palacio Rudas is also a dependence of the Bank of the Republic, and is located at the north of the city, with about 50,000 volumes. Other large public libraries are the Library of Congress in Colombia (with 100,000 volumes), of the Instituto Caro y Cuervo (with nearly 200,000 volumes, the largest Latin American library in Philology and Linguistics), the Library of the Academy of History The Library of the Academy of Language, the Library of the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History ICANH, and many university libraries.\nBogot\u00e1 is home to historical records housed in the General National Archive, a collection of about 60 million documents, one of the largest repositories of primary historical sources in Latin America. Bogot\u00e1 is also home to the Musical Archive of the Cathedral of Bogot\u00e1 (with thousands of books and choral song-colonial period), the Archdiocesan Archive, the Archive of the Conciliar Seminary of Bogot\u00e1, the Archive History National University of Colombia and the Archive of the Mint in Bogot\u00e1, under the Bank of the Republic.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nThe city offers 58 museums and over 70 art galleries. The Colombian National Museum has acquisitions divided into four collections: art, history, archeology and ethnography.

From the colonial period onwards, the city has been predominantly Roman Catholic. Proof of this religious tradition is the number of churches built in the historic city center. The city has been seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bogot\u00e1 since 22 March 1564. The seat of the Archbishop is the Primatial Cathedral of Bogot\u00e1; the archdiocese itself is located in new buildings in the north of the city. However a large group of the population nowadays declares itself non-practicing.The city has a mosque located in the area of Chapinero called the Estambul mosque, a mosque being built on the Calle 80 with Cra 30 called Abou Bakr Alsiddiq mosque and which is the first in the city to have the traditional Islamic architecture, and an Islamic Center called Al-Qurtubi.The main Ashkenazi Jewish synagogue (there are a total of 4 synagogues in Bogot\u00e1) is located on 94th street (also called State of Israel avenue).\nAn Eastern Orthodox church and the San Pablo Anglican Cathedral, the mother church of the Episcopal Church in Colombia, are both located in Chapinero.

The flag of Cundinamarca follows the same pattern, plus a light blue tile which represents the Virgin Mary's cape.\nThe flag itself is a yellow band above a red one. The yellow denotes the gold from the earth, as well as the virtues of justice, clemency, benevolence, the so-called \"mundane qualities\" (defined as nobility, excellence, richness, generosity, splendour, health, steadfastness, joy and prosperity), long life, eternity, power and constancy. The red denotes the virtue of charity, as well as the qualities of bravery, nobility, values, audacity, victory, honour and furor, Colombians call it the blood of their people.The coat of arms of the city was granted by emperor Charles V (Charles I of Spain) to the New Kingdom of Granada, by royal decree given in Valladolid, Spain on 3 December 1548. It contains a black eagle in the center, which symbolises steadfastness. The eagle is also a symbol of the Habsburgs, which was the ruling family of the Spanish empire at the time. The eagle is crowned with gold and holds a red pomegranate inside a golden background. The border contains olive branches with nine golden pomegranates on a blue background. The two red pomegranates symbolize audacity, and the nine golden ones represent the nine states which constituted the New Kingdom of Granada at the time. In 1932 the coat of arms was officially recognized and adopted as the symbol of Bogot\u00e1.Bogot\u00e1's anthem lyrics were written by Pedro Medina Avenda\u00f1o; the melody was composed by Roberto Pineda Duque. The song was officially declared the anthem by decree 1000 31 July 1974, by then Mayor of Bogot\u00e1, An\u00edbal Fernandez de Soto.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nBogot\u00e1 is twinned with:\n\n New York City, United States\n London, United Kingdom\n Chicago, United States (2009)\n Beirut, Lebanon\n Washington, D.C., United States\n Seoul, South Korea\n Baghdad, Iraq.\n Dubai, United Arab Emirates (2008)\n Miami, United States (1971)\n Tehran, Iran\n Lahore, Pakistan\n\n\n=== Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities ===\nBogot\u00e1 is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from 12 October 1982 establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\n\n=== Partnerships and cooperations ===\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes exist:\n\n Turin, Italy\n\n\n== Panoramas ==\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nBogot\u00e1's Carnival\nRail transport in Colombia\nTransport in Colombia\nWorld's largest cities\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography and further reading on pre-Columbian Bogot\u00e1 ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Muisca ===\nCorreal Urrego, Gonzalo. 1990.

          "Arrive in good time to avoid the coach trips but even if you find yourself queuing to get in the people soon disperse. Invest in the self-guided tour with headphones. Plan a route. Allow plenty of time. Stop for coffee and enjoy a unique experience",
          "We had a wonderful time visiting this architectural jewel. Next time I'd probably arrive early morning to enjoy its surroundings at a more relaxed pace. A must visit in Granada.",

          "Too many groups, too many people and not that much to look at really. Just a one long stretch of water, sculpted bushes and that's it. The views were good.",
          "The context, make-up and purpose of the Generalife is impressive. Everything was built not just with a design, but a purpose. Would recommend a private guide to offer more time with questions and time for photographs. A great experience.",
          "We had such an amazing half of the day at the Alhambra, Generalife and Palace. I would recommend to dedicate a whole day just to enjoy the beautiful architecture of the complex. Most be beautiful to go in spring season when you can enjoy the colorful display of the flowers at",
          "Our timed entry for the Nasrid Palaces was at 1:30 and we didn\u2019t want to be rushed, so we caught the C30 minibus from Plaza de la Catolica to the main entrance to the Alhambra, arriving about 10:30. Getting through the gate and security was quick but there was a wait to pick up",
          "This is a separate complex from the Alhambra. From here you can get the best views of the Alhambra's exterior. The gardens are also beautiful and you can see the hills around the Alhambra and the Albaizin (which is the city next to the Alhambra).",
          "Again how does one improve on thousands of reviews?Take plenty of time and get there as early as you can.good walking gear.GET taxi/bus up so you do not use too much energy as 6 hours here is not too much",
          "Came here straight after the Alhambra Palace. It\u2019s a beautiful site and the views are amazing. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Water fountains and the gardens go back to thousand years. There is attention to details when the gardens were built. Must see place.",
          "Magnificent gardens with mazes and topiary and an incredible world of growth. We were here in December - great time to miss the crowds, but also some of the beauty. Even a bit bare, we still loved it.",
          "Seems like everything in Granada is built to last a million years... or for giants. It's larger than life! A must see!",
          "If in Granada you must visit - stunning buildings and beautiful grounds Even in December with gardeners planting new flowers",
          "Visited in early December. Only had 20 minutes to visit as had to make a 4.30 slot for the Nasrid palace. Beautifully laid out and maintained gardens - only had time to explore half.",
          "Book s soon as you know that you will be in Granada. In the popular months, tour spots fill 1-2 months before. There are often tours available near the entrance that you can get at the last minute, but these will typically be more expensive. Discounts for students, seniors, etc.",
          "A wonderful part of visiting the Alhambra, a stunning garden, a very special place. We visited it after the Alhambra and took our time, as it's a lot to do in one day. Make sure to get your tickets in advance, and try to go in the off season. Even May was crowded.",

          "The tour required us to move quickly, but the views of both Alhambra and Granada are stunning. Walking through grounds that have been maintained to resemble it's appearance more than 700 years ago is amazing.",

          "Our tour ended with the Generalife. Beautiful gardens, architecture, fountains and views. Would love to return someday and just while away a day...",
          "As a part of the visit to the Alhambra, a stroll around the gardens complimented the palace very well. The designer of it has had a very good imagination and you'll be able to imagine the royals spending a sunny summer day here. Check the weather beforehand, though. I ended up",
          "We visited the Generalife and its gardens after the Nasrid Palaces, and enjoyed the outdoor walk and soothing plants and fountains. The Generalife can also be crowded, but people are more spread out, and you can take photos and enjoy the views without being surrounded by others.",
          "Well worth seeing the Generalife gardens as part of an Alhambra tour or visit. We were there in early November, so the gardens are probably more spectacular at other times of the year, but we still really enjoyed them.",
          "The Generalife (pronounced: Heneral-ife) palace and its landscaping is a beautiful addition to the fortress Alhambra. Plan ahead and get tickets 3 months in advance.",
          "By the time we got to the Generalife, we were well worn out from the incredible visit we had to the Alhambra. The Generalife is like the encore and well worth visiting.",
          "This section of The Alhambra has lovely gardens, and nice buildings. As I stated about The Alhambra, I thought I would like it more after years of hearing about it. Other sites in Southern Spain were more memorable.",
          "We visited after having toured the Alhambra. It\u2019s mid-November and the gardens are dying off so there\u2019s not much to see. It\u2019s not an essential must-see in my opinion. Sorry!",

          "Considered an entirely different tour than the Alhambra, Generalife are the gardens overlooking palace. Not to be missed, they are an exquisite collection of structure and texture continuously fed by an ingenious system of flowing water and fountains. We had an interesting tour",
          "The Generalife gardens are a bonus on top of a visit to the Alhambra. It's a pleasant stroll through very pretty gardens, eve in November. Well worth the extra walk!",
          "We booked our tickets online, which is just as well as they announced all the tickets were sold out shortly after we arrived. There are masses of things you are not allowed to do, but they dont seem to be bothered to give a good visitor experience at all. The place was tired",
          "After the wonder of the main Alhambra DO NOT leave before going to the gardens and experiencing a bit more of the splendour of this incredible wondrous area. The gardens are stunning at any time of year and well worth just a little more of your time and energy.",

          "This is my favourite part of the Alhambra and incredibly beautiful. Try to go when there are not too many other visitors. We were there on a Sunday late afternoon. The sun was just starting to go down as we left. It was heart stopping. The gardens and villas are filled with",

          "I don't know if it is possible to just visit the Generalife on its own since we had tickets for the Alhambra and Generalife. In itself it was a pleasure to visit. There are great views of the Alhambra and Granada.",
          "We headed here first as part of our visit to the Alhambra complex. We were here in May, so everything was in bloom (see the photos) and our tour guide explained about the different buildings and how they were used. It wasn't too busy in the afternoon, but I imagine it may be",

          "I didn't find the Generalife particularly interesting. I think the gardens in the Real Alc\u00e1zar are much better personally. What was interesting was the fact that the gardeners replant the gardens with plants suitable for each season but keep them consistent with plants used by",
          "We planned our trip carefully and as our timed entry to the palaces was for 1pm, we organised ourselves to arrive in Generalife for 11am. We walked up, taking in the natural beauty enroute, it's a steep walk but worth it. The gardens are lovely and abundant, it is easy to",

          "This was incredible! The gardens, the palace and the view of the rest of the Alhambra and Granada were truly stunning. This is definitely a must-see. The ticketing system is quite poor though - you have to book tickets online and in advance. I would recommend booking tickets",
          "A couple of weeks ago a group of 4 of us visited Granada and the Alhambra. We had already spent the best part of two hard days, in high temperatures seeing the town and the Alhambra but as the gardens were part of the ticket we had to make the time. It was a fairly",

          "The Generalife is the leisure palace of the sultans of the medieval Spain. Indeed, the layout of the palace and the surrounding gardens is surreal. Grand, organised, and simply breathtaking. The palace and gardens are so much similar to the Indian palaces and gardens built",
          "Multiple times while here I literally 'Ooo' and 'Ahhh' and 'Wow'ed out loud, and I'm not the oo'ing type of person. This is absolutely a must in Granada, and in my opinion, made our entire two-week trip to Spain worth it. Cannot be missed.",

          "Such a great walk through a beautiful garden. We went to Alhambra in the morning so when we walked the garden, it was still early in the day and not too hot (around 10am). And the layout and greenery of the garden was amazing. You follow a pathway which zigzags you through",
          "There are so many delights in the Generlife Gardens that is hard to single out one as an exemplar. Trellises with centuries thick vines, chockablock with flowers, pools surrounded with zinnias and other annuals, waterfalls descending from stairways, giant herb bushes, etc.,",
          "Situated on top of a hill, the Generalife is part of an iconic complex that must be visited when you are in Granada. The complex includes the Alhambra and Nasrid Palaces and you could easily spend a whole day here. We opted for a half day guided tour which gave us more",

          "Beautiful, and the gardens surrounding it, very instagrammable but definitely wear a bright piece of clothing to contrast the white building.",
          "We bought tickets for the generalife in conjunction with that of the alcazar. The place is easy to wander around, and the vast number of fountains, flowers and trees, makes this a place of inspiration and meditation. Really enjoyed our time here. Also, the views of the Alcazar",

          "Spent hours wandering around the gardens and buildings enjoying the history and beauty of the location. Although it was mid morning I could get many photos without other people in them and highly recommend spending some time here.",
          "We loved spending time in the gardens on our visit to The Alhambra. It was very relaxing, with benches everywhere and lots of shade and views from every angle. Definitely recommend making the trek up the hill to see these spaces.",
          "I liked this as much as the Nasrid palace, perfect to be seen together as you get a feel of what life was like.",
          "La Alhambra and El Generalife are certainly the most anticipated visits in Granada. If you are in Granada, you simply must visit them. Do not get surprised and get locked out from accessing them. You must book and reserve weeks in advance before your visit. The best way is",
          "Beautiful gardens, stunning backdrop Spent hours just wandering around. Worth every penny and more. Even the walk up from gran via is a dream",
          "The whole Alhambra experience is well worth it but a morning in the gardens and associated buildings is highly recommended. We visited mid morning before it was too hot although there are many beautiful big trees and places to retreat from the sun. Your visit to the Alhambra",
          "Beautiful, beautiful! A very special experience - fascinating history, exquisite architecture. Tips for enjoying the day. It was a 40 degree day but luckily we went early 12.30pm palace slot. Take water and a hat. Started with coffee and brioche at the Hotel America just",
          "Having visited during winter I had the desire to return and see the gardens growing and in bloom. Unlike the general access ticket where you have a fixed entry time to the Palaces I only needed the 7 Euro Generaliffe and Alcazaba ticket. This was great as it gives you license to",
          "Best avoid the hot afternoon sun to visit this place best in the morning or late on the afternoon. Beautiful gardens and views",
          "Don\u2019t miss the general life at Alhambra. Take your time, wear good walking shoes, drink water and enjoy all that is around you. Although it was very very busy, we did not feel rushed nor crowded.",
          "Generalife is as lovely as visiting the Alhambra. The gardens are sublime that you can happily wander for hours",
          "When we began booking our trip too Spain, it was already too late to get tickets to Alhambra. This was the only option available and it was on our first night in Spain after getting into Madrid that morning. I worried I\u2019d be too tired but it did not disappoint. It is impeccably",
          "This is truly a special place. The gardens are incredible and to see how they used the water from the nearby mountains was very interesting",
          "In ask honesty, the garden needs at least 90 minutes to see it all. Beautiful arrangements of flowers and greenery. Some rare plants also. Reflects the history of the area.",
          "The gardens are absolutely gorgeous and by far my favorite thing by the Alhambra. The green plants and wooden benches fit so perfectly with the beautiful water spraying. It is also a great place to take many photos with memories of this experience.",
          "Lovely Gardens if that's your thing, but palaces and buildings are not as interesting as others in Spain. Nice views of the city but it was a bit hazy on the day. We were part of an organised tour of Spain. We were given an audio guide of the Generalife as part of the tour",
          "We visited in June, to enjoy the Martha Graham Dance Company's performance. A spectacular location, with a magical ambience, and the Alhambra Palace providing a priceless backdrop. The air was scented, thanks to the Generalife Gardens - Fabulous !!! The roses in particular",
          "Although the entrance is arranged bu timeslots it is still busy and the only way to get an excellent picture moment , is to wsit some time till most of the visitors have moved on. But never the less it is still beautifull and worth a visit.",
          "A must visit when you visit the city of Granada. The plants were nicely blooming and the space was calm. It can get busy in some spots but the crowds can thin in some parts to give you space to enjoy it.",
          "This was the second time here. Last time plants were suffering of hot summer. This year, hot summer also, but gardens were very beautiful. Morning, before Alhambra is the best time for photos.",
          "Such a nice place, please take a guide, you will need it for sure !! and WHEN THEY SAY DON'T TOUCH, YOU DON'T TOUCH ! PLEASE!",
          "if you like pompeii you will love this one there is grass and trees Earthquakes and looting diminish the over all experience",
          "It'a part of the same visit to Alhambra and really enjoyable. Again, one may admire what is made several centuries ago for all day.",
          "Walking through the Generalife, you can imagine the royalty over the centuries strolling through the gardens smelling the roses. This was spectacular at night, with impressive views looking down on the main palace, along with the various fountains and walls of flowers in the",
          "Upon entering the Alhambra we went to look at this first. Beautiful garden and buildings, well set out.",
          "The Generalife Gardens are well worth a visit. What an exquisite environment to meditate on the beauty of nature. The Spanish gardeners have actually been able to replicate the exact flowers that were grown in these gardens centuries ago. It's all very authentic and all very",
          "Beautiful palace, well located, with very interesting history and excellent view. Plan correctly your visit, with information and enjoy.",
          "Generalife is the quieter part of the Alhambra site but is definitely worth the effort to walk just that little bit more. As well as being attractive in its own right, it provides stunning views back towards the other palaces. Much fun can also be had watching the youngsters",
          "A guided tour is best another first class location for photos Popular spot be prepared for the crowds",
          "Generalife was part of the Alhambra tour. Our guide was knowledgeable.. The grounds are beautiful and provide many photo opportunities.",
          "Not bad I guess but I have traveled to so many palaces and seen so many courtyards that were better than the Generalife. The entire Alhambra and Generalife visit for me was a one time did it and checked it off experience.",
          "A delightful variety of fruit trees and flowers accompanied by neatly trimmed box hedges provides for an inspirational visit.",
          "with very cool gardens (literally) to cool one off. Amazing how the fountains, canals & bridges also flowed from upper to lower levels and had been engineered to do so for centuries.",
          "Great gardens and flower beds. Chilled atmosphere if not too crowded. Take your time and enjoy. There are plenty of benches for you to relax and enjoy the views.",
          "Great to see this special place which was historicly filled with romance. No need to miss this when your visiting",
          "Worth a visit. Alot of walking required. Not stroller accessible in some areas. Book tickets in advance, otherwise they will sell out and group tours from other companies will charge you a hefty amount.",
          "Not the best garden I\u2019ve ever seen but worth it for the views and the summer palace. When you buy your ticket make sure it includes this area as all areas don\u2019t appear to be included with some tickets.",
          "Go early to avoid the crowds and sit in the quiet of the beautiful gardens. Very well maintained. Stunning!",
          "The Generalife is adjacent to the Alhambra and can be and should be visited on same visit. Wonderful gardens and spectacular palace full of history and stories.",
          "Be sure to visit it before you go to Palacios Nazaries - very well manicured. Nice relaxing atmosphere and can make nice picture",
          "The recreational palace at Alhambra is of course not as impressive as the Nasir palace but very impressive in its own right.",
          "It is stunningly beautiful night view in Generalife. It's coolly in the night and less crowded as compared to the day time. The garden is neatly covered with different types of roses or flowers. The well-lit streets/houses seem like stars on the Earth from the windows of the",
          "Don't miss this area, and make sure you enter at the stated time on your ticket - or you may not get in at all! Take your camera / phone, lots of things to remember here.",
          "A very relaxing part of the overall Alhambra tour. Not too many elevation changes and can be done at your own pace when your scheduled tour has completed.",
          "The Generalife has a much different feel to the main Alhambra fortress. The formal gardens are amazing and so is the Generalife palace. You also get spectacular views looking back at the Alhambra. By far our favourite part.",
          "I wouldn't pay extra to see it unless you are into gardens. The gardens and surrounding area is nice to see but the inside is just ok and after visiting the Alhambra, kind of a let down. It's part of most tour packages but if you are going as an individual and paying extra for",
          "Along with the Alhambra, Generalife is a must see on your Grenada visit. Part of the whole Alhambra complex, be sure to give enough time to explore the beautiful gardens and relax in the shade. The fountains and water steps are sure to soothe the soul.",
          "We were only able to book tickets to the Generalife and Alcazaba on our trip to Granada. However, the gardens were overwhelmingly beautiful, shady and cool and entertained the kids for hours. In retrospect, more walking that the Gerealife and Alcazaba would have been too much",
          "The green space was very welcome after the bustle of the Nasrid Palaces. Beautiful gardens - just needs a little more seating areas in the shade.",
          "Very calming if it wasn't for the amount of tourists. Absolutely beautiful and gardens so well maintained.",
          "We had a guide - we listened through an ear piece . The tour was two hours- and very informative. Easy going and gave you the chance to stay after the tour and go back to places and take photos. A lovely afternoon.",
          "Combine this tour with the Alhabrama its well worth it. Go in the middle of the day and whilst it may be hotter the crowds are less",
          "Stunning views. Wear comfortable shoes. There are nice benches on the lower level facing Alhambra. Bring a camera or two. There are nice clean bathrooms on the lower level.",
          "The gardens were beautiful, as were the views. This was part of the Alhambra tour we took and we stayed in Generalife after the tour was over. The roses were in full bloom and magnificent. There are plenty of shaded areas and the gardens and pathways were exceptionally",
          "Stunning. Just beautiful. Very well maintained gardens with magnificent greenery and the most beautiful flowers. So colourful. So fragrant. The roses are truly amazing. The flows of water are so wonderful and lovely to hear.",
          "If the gardens had been maintained and/or restored to their beauty, it have have been worth it, but as it is now, it is not really that impressive. There are some good views of the ancient city and the nearby mountains from the garden though.",
          "We started our day at the Alhambra complex with a visit to Generalife. A great experience and a good introduction to the rest of the tour. Most recommended, especially with a guide!",
          "When I entered to this place i though Wowwwwwww........can\u2019t describe exactly how beautiful it is. Each corner is magic..... 5 hours spending in this place is worth it ... you will never regret to visit this place. You have to book in advance your ticket mainly 1 month in",
          "This is like a paradise with too many rare trees, flowers, butterflies, small water canals and stairs. This colorful and stunning gardens were the Summer palace and gardens of the Arab rulers of Granada. They were built during the reign of Muhammed II (1273-1302), Sultan of",
          "After a few hours walking through the palaces and the Alcazaba it was so wonderful to find these stunning gardens with their water features and vistas. Highly recommend.",
          "You will visit the Generalife as part of the Alhambra tour and it is fantastic. Its a bit of a walk up the hill but is worth it for the view of the Alhambra Complex alone.",
          "It\u2019s incredible how a garden can be so beautiful and colorful in a city with a semi-arid climate! You can spend hours just taking photos and looking at the flowers and small constructed lakes..",
          "The routes of the irrigation system is one of the most interesting things to see in the gardens. The restoration of traditional kitchen gardens is an interesting project. We saw this at the end of our Alhambra tour, and sadly, did not give it the time it deserved. Maps could",
          "We thought this was one of the most interesting areas of the Alhambra. The gardens and the summer palace were so very different and the views were magnificent.",
          "Worthwhile to see the historical site and associated gorgeous gardens. Nice vistas to be had. We would get a guide next time as being told during the visit gives you a better feeling than reading before hand.",
          "Visiting in May, the gardens were in full bloom. But these aren't just any gardens. Moorish influences are everywhere in the layout with fountains, plantings, types of plants and mixtures of veg and flowers to support every aspect of general life.",
          "Generalife Palace and gardens are separated from the rest of the Alhambra complex, and it takes 20 to 30 minutes walking through nice botanic gardens to get there from the area where Alcazaba, Palace of Carlos V and Palacios Nazaries are located. The gardens are very beautiful,",
          "I didn\u2019t plan ahead and couldn\u2019t get tickets for the main buildings in Alhambra, so I just got the Generalife night ticket. Was only 5 euros and I was so glad I did it. Pretty quick tour - stayed about an hour - because at night a lot of paths are closed off. But the gardens",
          "Well worth a visit, be sure to wear flat comfortable shoes and I would avoid summer peak season as very hot and its very open.",
          "Lots of different fountains around the property made this worthwhile to me. The gardens are well maintained and enjoyable to walk through.",
          "Most romantic summer palace. Not too opulent. Hut amazing natural beauty. The views are simply wonderful. Worth going with a guided tour",
          "So beautiful! If you\u2019re a history, garden or architecture lover, make sure you visit this place and plan to spend at least 2-3 hours to walk around and enjoy the scenery. I highly recommend a guided tour to maximize your experience.",
          "A wonderful garden to visit while inside the Alhambra. Well manicured. Interesting variety of plants. Beautiful views.",
          "Lovely but extremely crowded so there was no opportunity to spend anytime just looking. We were on a guided tour which I would recommend",
          "Part of the Alhambra complex, this is across a small valley from the rest of the buildings. There are several different gardens, all different in style and full of plants and flowers. We visited in early March and there were peonies, iris and the wisteria was just starting to",
          "This place is in Alhambra, definetely not in city center. Tourists can get confused a lot. Change the spot please.",
          "We walked here from our hotel and it was a great way to arrive. It was really my favorite part of the Alhambra. I suggest going early in the day to avoid the larger crowds.",
          "Generalife is a \u201cmust see.\u201d The Alhambra complex is quite amazing but the Generalife adds so much to the visit. This is the place the Moorish rulers went to rejuvenate and excuse themselves from the crowds. The flowers and water features are exquisite.",
          "As with the Alhambra, virtually all the negative reviews are driven by ticket issues. Book in advance and pay attention to ticket details and all will be well, and well worth it. The gardens were so beautiful that we came up with some ideas for our home efforts, and the palace",
          "I highly recommend visiting early in the morning, as we did. Easy parking, no crowds, lovely and cool. The gardens and palace are magnificent and extremely well maintained. The audio guides are excellent. Concise and informative. Thoroughly lived up to expectations",
          "This was the best part of our visit to Alhambra. It was not as crowded as the main area and had magnificent gardens and surrounds. Its a classic example of architecture that has been designed to accomodate the seasons with water features and the beautiful colours and scents of",
          "Let's put it clear: the garden is very beautiful and the view is amazing. However I didn't find this place as unique and original as it always presented. Just thinking about it for a minute and I could name a few almost identical places in other European countries. Considering",
          "If you can afford only to see the gardens then it is worth the time as they are absolutely exquisite. They are arranged over different levels, around small courtyards and fountains. You can lose yourself and the best time to visit is April to may when all the plants are in full",
          "We were there at the end of April and everything was blooming! Not hard to see why the Muslims envisioned paradise as a garden once you have visited these gardens.",
          "I could live here! Just loved the gardens and what I saw of the buildings, which wasn't much unfortunately. Go early or late - tour groups tend to spoil one's visit here.",
          "This is another must see place if you are visiting Granada. April was very busy so trying to get a good photograph was just about impossible, but it is worth visiting",
          "The area is huge and beautiful gardens including in courtyards inside the building. Very pleasant walk.",
          "Don\u2019t miss these gardens on your visit to Alhambra! If your lucky the roses are in full bloom! The beautiful gardens, the fountains, the majestic arches, all amazing!! Don\u2019t miss it!!!",
          "We went in April when the gardens were in full bloom, the scents of the different flowers was incredible. A combined tour of the Alhambra and Generalife not to be missed. Must pre-book.",
          "Luckily it was sunny (on a rainy day) and we managed to capture the beauty of the gardens. Definitely worth exploring.",
          "I visited here as part of my guided tour around Alhambra as the same ticket allows you access to Generalife. This was the summer palace and boasts beautiful gardens as well as interior design work with tiles and plasterwork. Well worth a visit for the beautiful interior and",
          "This is a perfect place to go and probably THE place, along with Alhambra to see in this entire area. It is also a MUST-SEE experience!",
          "This was the least appealing part of the Alhambra for me. The walk to the buildings has very nice views but the gardens, even though very green, were a bit underwhelming. The area with the fountains was pretty and one could just picture the king spending time here for",
          "BOOK AHEAD...way ahead! We were only able to get tickets for the Generalife and Gardens. The palace entry were all booked. Still, with the audio-guide, it was very enjoyable. The skip-the-line tours can be available last minute, but they're super expensive compared to what",
          "You need to have reasonable mobility to explore properly. Busy gardens, not really the place to stop and chill, though if you can grab a seat do! Views are beautiful and the mountains too. Busy",
          "Water symbolizes life for the ancient architects and residents of this garden and summer palace. This place is luxurious with water fountains in all directions, especially the Patio of the Sultana where it provides sound, beauty and natural air conditioning.. Geometry prevails",
          "The Generalife is out by itself but an essential part of a visit to the Alhambra Palace. Remember it's time orientated entry in relation to your morning or afternoon ticket.",
          "Majestic, large fruit, vegetable and ornamental gardens adjacent to the Alhambra. Impressive and enhanced by cats.",
          "take the time to walk the gardens during your visit to Alhambra. They are beautiful and the grounds are filled with all types of flowers, shrubs and trees and magnificent views of the Alhambra and the city.",
          "Even if you're not into gardens, taking a walk here is worth your time. The way the pipe in water via the stairs, the architecture of both buildings and gardens is amazing.",
          "And to think we almost missed it because we were exhausted at the end of our day. In hindsight, I'd have done this first and then move on to the main Medina area, especially as there are exits at the bottom of h tree complex which would see you so much closer to the city centre.",
          "This was a fascinating outside event around the alhambra.the guide gave us valuable insights into life at the alhambra.over time and the beaitoful buildis brought to life what life would be like in earlier times.",
          "Visited as part of a trip to the Alhambra (one ticket covers the Alcazar, garens and Generalife but not the palaces). The water gardens are beautiful and must be really cooling in the summers. The walk through the gardens also offers lovely views across the city and to Albayzin",
          "The Generalife is the \"garden\" part of the Alhambra and includes some buildings. It has sculpted shrubbery, etc.",
          "Beautiful gardens within the Alhambra complex, with lots to see even in January. Don't miss this off your Granada itinerary!",
          "If you're in Granada you have to visit Alhambra and Generalife. We chose a guided tour, and we are glad that we did. It was so beautiful and interesting. Lots of tourists, even if it's low season. Recommend this place, but remember to book tickets in advance.",
          "Generalife were the royal gardens and summer palace for Nasrid rulers (Muslim rulers) of Granada. Gardens are a part of Alhambra and as being on the top of the hill, are a perfect location for scenic views and shots of the city of Granada. While walking around royal gardens one",
          "The definition of sublime, shares the experience of Generalife: of such excellence, grandeur, or beauty as to inspire great admiration or awe",
          "In the heat of a Granada day the Generalife was a beautiful respite from the sun. To walk in the garden and hear the water running was heaven on earth",
          "Our lives are crazy. Going to the Alhambra and then to Generalife gives all a chance to regroup and unplug and remember what it\u2019s like to truly be in the moment. The sound of water, the beauty of the vegetation, the fountains, the gardens, the peaceful serenity cannot be",
          "Huge garden but the main attraction are the the gardeners who keep this place looking like an over-excessive garden of rich people. Note: it offers shade so scout that out at all times. The watering system is truly amazing - if you care. Also the people who cut the hedges are",
          "Be sure to include this with your tour of Alhambra. If you get a tour guide, be sure his/her English is not so heavily accented that you cannot understand the narrative. If we had to do it again, we would use an audio tour as we could not understand our guide\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d",
          "Generalife is a masterpiece! although it was renovated, im sure they kept the main lines of the garden setups.. its just a huge pleasure to visit the gardens and relax underneath a wild orange tree",
          "We toured Alhambra w/ a guide for 3.5 hours. That tour was wonderful, but Generalife was a real surprise. The gardens here were lovely and it was such a surprise to learn that it was their get-away next door to their permanent residence. We learned so much here that it was all",
          "If you can't get into the full Alhambra, this is well worth the trip. It's the Spanish portion of the complex.",
          "Compared to the Nazrid Palaces, which allows limited people at any time, this place was a madhouse. It was crowded and I felt I was back in India in a bazaar. There were busloads of Chinese tourists who were very rude, inconsiderate and pushy. Sad, considering the attraction",
          "Must visit. It's very maintained and offers lot of history. Do make sure to also visit the palace when you book thistrip",
          "This is not to be missed. The gardens are beautiful with rows of cypress trees. The gardens are similar to French gardens. Not to be missed",
          "It is difficult to explain how we feel about Generalife. It would be better to see the gardens and palace in separate days to allow the time needed to take everything in.",
          "The Generalife is a part of the Alhambra Complex and you will get in there with the general admission Alhambra Ticket. The gardens are so beautifully kept and the palace with the fountains is gorgeous. Dont expect any furniture inside, its just the shell, but the gardens, the",
          "The gardens were really beautiful. The water features were gorgeous and made for some beautiful pictures.",
          "If Adam & Eve were here they would have been obsessed with selfies like everyone else and the history of the world would have played out differently. The garden goes on forever and even offers shade.",
          "By far the best bit of the Alhambra as far as I am concerned. Especially in the heat of summer when the dry wind and reflected heat from the slabs of stone and concrete that from the castle dehydrate the avergaetourist rapidly whilst adding little to their aesthetic",
          "Visited as part of a guided tour of the Alhambra palace, well worth visiting, pleasant gardens to stroll around and some great views over Granada and th\u00e9 Alhambra.",
          "Do not miss out Generalife at Alhambra - it is the best, most beautiful part of the complex. Outside the Alhambra are well laid out gardens and walkways and a descent on foot through them is well worth it, nice views, access to the gate of Justice etc. But I did feel sorry for",
          "Have to see and enjoy avery part of it , great buildings and historical place that shows how great the civilization behind .",
          "Seeing is believing, A cultural treat, and the history given by the tour guide was really helpful, highly recommend you pre book a tour to get the best out of your visit",
          "When you visit the Alhambra, you have the option to add on a visit to this palace as well. The gardens are lovely and the offer a great view of the town and the Alhambra.",
          "Part of the Alhambra visit and right after the palace. Excellent views. Well worth it and not to be missed.",
          "Another bucket list item, ticked off. Beautiful gardens and restoration. The fountains although not original to the Muslim version...where glorious.",
          "Not to be missed. Book your tickets on line and well in advance. Plan to arrive early as it gets quite crowded early.",
          "Visited the generalife mid morning following our visit to the Nasrid Palace. Fantastic views both down toward the old town of Granada and also up toward the Serria Nevada mountains (still with snow on in March). Like Alhambra the gardens are lovely, as are the buildings, but not",
          "Superb, details magnificient.Trees, flower blooming, the water, the silence... I wish just to see on the night visit 9in summer)",
          "We visited as part of a tour which provided interesting information and background history. The tour was somewhat rushed however and it would have been nice to have a slower pace to take everything in. Beautiful location above the Alhambra, very busy.",
          "This attraction is just outside the walls of the bigger attraction. It\u2019s on a hillside and is quite beautiful. The building itself is more of the same as to the other area. The gardens are very nice and have several water features. It\u2019s definitely worth seeing when on a visit",
          "Yup, this is situated just above and beside Alhambra. Beautiful setting and easy to find. Bring you camera and your walking shoes.",
          "Well, just go, it is incredible. Being camera and notebook. Very evocative. Extraordinary experience in a lifetime of travel.",
          "We toured this as part of the tour of Alhambra. It was very pleasant to view. We were there on a beautiful day and the views were amazing.",
          "The gardens will be amazing in the spring/ summer when all the blooms are out and the views are fabulous from the terraces",
          "Not the star of the show in Alhambra, but interesting as part of the overall experience. Maybe 40 minutes or so.",
          "We came on a private tour at 1pm and it was fairly quiet. The gardens are wonderful. A visit to Alhambra and Generalife is all together in my mind.",
          "Nice place to visit, quite calm, but overcrowded and rushed. Nice water features and some good restorations",
          "Spent the entire day in the Alhambra and Generalife and it was all stunning. Worthwhile pre purchasing tickets and organise your visit around the fixed entry time for the Nazrid Palaces.",
          "I loved the gardens and fountains of Generalife. It felt a world away from the rest of the Alhambra. So relaxing to just sit by one of the numerous fountains and enjoy the sun and serenity.",
          "Lovely garden with nice view to the Alhambra. The park is easy to access and is very clean and green.",
          "Beautiful gardens, right next to the Alhambra. Don't miss it out by only focusing on its neighbor. The most interesting part is the Generalife Palace, a recreational Palace where the sultan could escape the intrigues of the Alhambra court. Here are several gems to discover like",
          "Originally the Sultans gardens but taken over by some 'pesky' Christians a good few hundred years ago !! Even in winter these gardens are delightful. Plenty of garden architectuee to give height and interest. Imaginative use of water too. Just beautiful.",
          "Do not miss its visit, it is a wonderful place to wander. Nice palace with water pools and fountains and very pleasant garden to spend some time",
          "we got the combined tickets...alllow a goof 4 hours ... its a great day out especially on less hot days...but buy your tickets on the official site.... beware scammers.",
          "My partner and I joined a tour and we are so glad that we did as we would've missed so much information. What lovely grounds.",
          "Not as good as the Alhambra itself, but still worth visiting the summer palace. You get some good views of the Alhambra. The Generalife has undergone an awful lot of renovation and not all of it good.",
          "The Alhambra consists of several parts, one of which is this garden setting. In February, there are not many plants blooming or even growing. There are a couple of nice areas but much of it is barren, which is not surprising since this is their winter season! On the day we",
          "Walking through, it is easy to imagine the Sultan spending time here. It\u2019s beautifully laid out and cool, just what is wanted on a hot summer day",
          "A guided night time tour is a great way to discover this always crowded gem. We had a great guide with many interesting stories and details about the buildings.",
          "A lovely part of the Alhambra. The sultan and his intimates spent summers here, to escape the court and the heat. It was lovely even in January.",
          "Beautiful gardens even in Winter. I think it would be worth visiting each season to check out the changes.",
          "I have never seen such a big and well made garden. Maybe the most impressive I have seen all over Europe so far!",
          "We visited in winter, so the gardens were not in bloom, but the symmetry, water, and birdsong is beautiful in any season. With little effort you can imagine the Sultans and Sultanas strolling through this lovely site.",
          "The stunning edifice, within the Alhambra is a must. It oozes palacial history. One can imagine the original residents relaxing in the gardens.",
          "We visited as part of our tour of the Alhambra but given the time of year there wasn\u2019t a great deal to see. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a very different story during spring and summer and the gardeners were hard at work. It does however provide some great views over the Alhambra and gives a",
          "If you see Alhumbra you see Generalife ... the winter Palace section of Alhumbra. This whole complex is a must see ...",
          "Well-manicured gardens and soothing sounds of water from the fountains that are gravity-fed. The water steps are particularly enjoyable. Relive the good lives of the Sultan and Sultana! (Though watch out for a knife in the back and for approaching Christians). Of course,",
          "Just before the entrance, the curator of the place built an amazing garden for you to walk through. The Generalife itself is historical and beautiful. Giving you a glimpse of how the sultanates of the past spend their time away from the palace (though not too far away).",
          "Generalife is attached to the Alhambra and was part of our tour. It is fascinating and well worth a visit!",
          "Entrance is via the Alhambra site and it is best to pre-book your tickets and don't be too late. If you get there too late they are quite strict and we did see people turned away - albeit very politely. As with the Alhambra I would suggest taking food and drinks in with you, as",
          "Gorgeous gardens and views, even in the winter! We loved the Alahambra and the gardens are great. It's worth the walk. Just make sure to book a reservation before you go, and make sure you are at the Palace no later than 60 minutes after the time of your ticket, or you will not",
          "The palace is beautiful, but people working in alhambra are not reliable when giving info. We have been told that generalife was accessible with strollers, but we arrived there after 20mins walk and they told us \"we know, our colleagues say it is accessible but it's not true\"...",
          "Nights in the Spanish Gardens by Manuel de Falla came to my mind when walking the gardens of the Generalife. What else?",
          "Went early and was nice to walk around prior to the crowds. Takes around 40 mins comfortably. Start here from the main entrance.",
          "Such an interesting history. The gardens are what gave this site its world heritage status as they carefully researched the plants and lay out of what would oriogionally be on the site.",
          "The gardens can be crowded so go early morning not first thing try around 10am. It helps to get some background reading in if you are not going to hire a guide. The plantings in October were sparse if you want to see them in full bloom you should go earlier than October",
          "You can't miss this place out when you go explore Granada! There is so much to shoot. Must b\u00e8 amazing in spring \ud83d\udd25",

          "I would visit Alhambra - Alcazaba and Nasri Palace, first, then visit Generalife. Not the other way around. Why? Generalife, which is a garden, has so much to see and you would be exhausted after walking on Generalife. Also there is a \"natural\" exit and walkways, coming out",
          "Where all types of flowers, fruits and vegetable are planted like pieces of art. Well worth a walk through, especially in the summer or autumn.",
          "A visit to the Generalife is a natural extension to one of Alhambra. It helps to make you understand the cultural excellence that was the style of the sultans who lived there. The courtyard gardens are delightful. The use of water and orange trees as well as the views over the",

          "The Generalife is the summer palace in Granada. The palace is lovely, not as lovely on the inside as the Alhambra is. The gardens are simply spectacular and are well worth walking through. I would strongly recommend visiting.",

          "Gorgeous place of the Alhambra, with views that are breath taking! we visited in November so didn't see many flowers blooming, but did get to see some pomegranate here and there. The staircase of water is in this area which is also an amazing feat to see how they captured water",

          "The garden and water features were peaceful and allowed you to sense the tranquillity. The views across to the main Alhambra site were excellent.",
          "Not like the Alhambra in terms of beauty and detail, but also worth visiting. I have seen beautiful gardens in other locations, and is comporable. The edge here is the history.",

          "It rained when we decided to visit Generalife..well I guess you cant have it all..lol Mother nature was truly on the loose..lol Our visit was part of the ticket to Alhambra. This garden is stunning and truly makes you want to become an gardener.. (ok maybe not) but sure makes",

          "Even in the autumn, the Generalife is worth a visit. You won't have many flowers but you'll still get the greenery, the gorgeous layout of the gardens, and the palace of the Generalife with its fountains and spectacular views. If you have tickets to the Nasrid palace, when you",

          "Very nice gardens and summer palace of the Alhambra. When we visited at the end of October I felt it was much smaller than I expected. I am not sure if some of it was closed or if it is actually smaller than I had imagined. However, it should not be missed on any tour of the",

          "Just north of the Alhambra, with terraces leading from the Palacio del Partal past the Torre de las Infantas, the gardens of the Generalife are a real delight. There are formal parts of the garden with patios such as the Patio de Polo and the Sala Regla and there is also the",
          "We enjoyed the garden just fine. We could have skipped it all together but it was a nice stroll. Nice way to spend a summer day.",
          "It's confusing. The Palace, the Alhambra, the Generalife. It's really parts of the same thing, overall the Alhambra as the catch-all. The Alhambra though is really the fortress. The Generalife refers to the gardens and the Palace is the Palace. It's all accessible through",
          "By the time we got there it was very busy, but this did not detract from the delight of the place. Taking time to stroll slowly is a good thing to do. And the views across the valleys are amazing.",
          "We were surrounded by tours, but it\u2019s nice to wonder around and look at the plants and fruit tress, whilst enjoying the great view over the City. It rained the day we were there, but I\u2019ve seen it when it\u2019s hot and sunny. Pure magic, rain or shine.",
          "What a wonderful place! A little piece of paradise on Earth reflecting the Islamic philosophy on gardens- an interaction of water, foliage, shade and privacy. And you have all of that in abundance here. My favourite spot wasn\u2019t necessarily the most beautiful- just above the",

Be careful of the Berger\u2019s and the fortune teller lady\u2019s stop you in the middle of the street touch you and start talking. We did not like that and you have to pay them if not they get rude",

          "The gardens at the Generalife are more authentic to what they would have looked like in Muslim times than the gardens at the Alcazaba in Sevilla, and definitely are worth a look. They are very popular, and a morning visit is a cooler time to see them.",
          "Included in the general admission ticket, this was such a beautiful and peaceful stroll. The different species of flowers and flora were breathtaking. The ancient pools and fountains were stunning.. Definitely take a bit of extra time to see. Buy advance tickets with entry times",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Sacromonte, sometimes also called Sacramonte, is a traditional neighbourhood in the eastern area of the city of Granada in Andalusia, Spain. It is one of the six neighbourhoods that make up the urban district of Albayz\u00edn and borders the neighbourhoods of Albayz\u00edn, San Pedro, Realejo-San Mat\u00edas, El Fargue and Haza Grande. \nIt is located on the hillside and in the valley of Valpara\u00edso, opposite the Alhambra - emblem of Granada. The neighbourhood occupies both banks of the Darro river, whose name seems to be derived from the phrase \"d'auro\" (\"of gold\") because of its famous gold-bearing sediments.\nTraditionally the neighborhood of the Granadian Romani, who settled in Granada after the Christian conquest of the city in 1492, it is one of the most picturesque neighbourhoods of the city, with cave houses installed in whitewashed caves.The Romani of Sacromonte have a mixed language known as Cal\u00f3, which has seen a rapid decline in use over the past century. It is derived from India, where the Romani originated. The Romani of Sacromonte were famously portrayed by the poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca in his book of poems Romancero Gitano.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe neighborhood owes its name to an episode which occurred between 1595 and 1599 on the hill of Valpara\u00edso: the supposed discovery of relics and the so-called \"lead books\" or \"Lead Books of Sacromonte\", containing indecipherable drawings and texts in Latin and Arabic characters, which came to be interpreted by some as the fifth gospel. These findings were declared a forgery in the 17th century, but nonetheless led to the construction of the Abbey of Sacromonte, where the supposed relics of Saint Caecilius (co-patron of Granada) and the lead books are now kept.\n\n\n== Origin of the caves ==\n\nThe origin of the houses excavated on the slopes of Sacromonte, the traditional dwelling type of the neighborhood, is not very clear. It is assumed that they began to be built from the 16th century, after the Jewish and Muslim populations were expelled from their homes, and intermixed with the nomadic Romani, adopting some of their customs. The caves became housing for the marginalized, located outside the walls of the city, which meant being outside of administrative and ecclesiastical control, particularly the Spanish Inquisition. To dig a cave it was necessary to carve away a part of the face of the hill where they wanted to build, making a vertical cut that served as a facade. The builder then inserted an arch at the midpoint to serve as a door. They then excavated as much space for rooms as the terrain would allow.The forms and limits of this unique house type are determined by the terrain, altitude and extent of the hills where the excavation takes place, so there are no two identical caves. These elements, along with the paths, gullies, small squares, whitewashed facades and interiors form a unique landscape, alongside the customs and crafts of their inhabitants, giving the neighbourhood a unique character.In addition to the troglodyte houses, another important feature of the neighbourhood is the legends that relate to all corners and places, one of the most well-known being the Ravine of the Blacks.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== A neighbourhood legend: Ravine of the Blacks (Barranco de los Negros) ==\nPopular legends hold that after the loss of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs in the Granada War, the formerly ruling Arabs - who made their way in exile to African lands - never gave up hope of someday returning to the city of their parents and grandparents, where they and their children were born.\nAfraid of being preyed upon by bandits or groups of renegade Christian soldiers on the roads to the ports of Almu\u00f1\u00e9car or Almer\u00eda, where they embarked for Africa, they hid great treasures among the olive groves which at the time covered Sacromonte.At the same time, they granted freedom to the many slaves owned by the noble Arab families, because of the expense and difficulty of performing the journey with a large entourage. Many of these slaves were black, and had noticed the comings and goings of their former owners to Mount Valpara\u00edso (as the area was then called), were aware of their former owners' fears and had overheard many conversations between them regarding burying their possessions. Granted their freedom but without work or belongings, many decided to climb the mountain and recover for themselves the treasures that had once belonged to their former owners.They dug and dug into the slopes of the ravine reportedly without success, and exhausted by the effort but left with no alternative shelter, decided to condition the resulting caves and make them their homes. This gave the area the name of \"Ravine of the Blacks\", as these were believed to be the first inhabitants.\nIn later years, as Roma began to settle in the area, they supposedly attempted to use many spells in search of the exact places where the treasures were hidden. Many older witches, known as ferminib\u00ed, were reported to try talking with water and others with fire, or staring unblinking into basins of water, trying to get some clues to the locations of the lost treasures. To this day it is unknown whether any were discovered and secretly taken away by treasure seekers, or if the treasures remain hidden in the area.\n\n\n== Other sights ==\n\n\n=== Abbey and College of the Sacromonte; Holy Caves ===\nIn addition to the numerous caves, the main monument of the neighbourhood is the Abbey of Sacromonte, built by Archbishop Pedro de Castro y Qui\u00f1ones in 17th century near the summit of the hill, where the alleged relics and other remains of the first Christians of Granada and evangelizers of Roman Baetica; including Saint Caecilius, martyr and first bishop of the city in the 1st century CE; and other apostolic figures including companions of Saint James, were discovered. The College of Sacromonte was founded by Pedro de Castro as an annex to the abbey.The abbey consists of the abbey itself (17th century), the Old College of San Dionisio Areopagita (17th century), the New College (19th century) and the \"Holy Caves\" (Santas Cuevas). The abbey has an important library with numerous incunabula and manuscripts, but which is currently closed to the public. The Santas Cuevas are old catacombs which contain several chapels. In one of these, according to tradition, James the Less officiated. This is where the festival of Saint Caecilius takes place.\nThe abbey also contains the School of the Holy Mary, founded by teacher and priest Andr\u00e9s Manj\u00f3n - known as Padre Manj\u00f3n - at the beginning of 20th century to teach Romani children, and whose pedagogical innovations are still in use.\nThe abbey is the canonical seat of the Confraternity of the Romani. Mass is celebrated every Sunday at noon.\n\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nIn Carrera del Darro there are numerous monuments, including:\n\nThe Arabic Casa de Zafra, built at the end of the 14th century and which now serves as the headquarters of the Centro de Estudios Hist\u00f3ricos.\nCasa de Castril, dating from the 16th century, which has beautiful Mud\u00e9jar coffers and a plateresque facade. The building is currently operated by the Archaeological and Ethnological Museum of Granada.\nConvento de Santa Catarina de Zafra, founded in 1520, which includes a small preserved Arab house of the 11th century.\nPalacio de los C\u00f3rdova, built by the Dukes of Montellano, currently housing the Archive of Granada.\nIglesia de  San Gil y Santa Ana, a 16th century church.\nEl Ba\u00f1uelo or Bath del Nogal or de los Axares, a hamam (bathhouse) built on the Darro river in the 11th century during the reign of the Zirid King Badis ben Habus, one of the most well-preserved in Spain.\nFountain del Avellano, made famous by the works of \u00c1ngel Ganivet.\nThe Museum Caves of Sacromonte, an ethnographic museum.\n\n\n== Fiestas ==\nGranada celebrates the Fiestas de San Cecilio (Saint Caecilius) on the first Sunday in February with a pilgrimage to Sacromonte; the Carnival, also in February; and the D\u00eda de Mariana Pineda in May grows more important each year. Holy Week has rapidly achieved great importance. The neighbourhood of Sacromonte celebrates its own neighbourhood fiestas for the first ten days of August.\n\n\n== Native cuisine ==\n\nTortilla del Sacromonte\n\n\n== Famous Sacromontinos ==\nMariana Pineda\nChorrojumo\n\n\n== See also ==\nZambra, a dance which originated in this Granadian neighbourhood\n\n\n== Notes ==\nTranslated from the Portuguese and Spanish Wikipedias\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFlamenco recording from 1962 in Sacramento\nThe Wise Men of Sacromonte, 2013 documentary\nhttp://granadamap.com/abadia/indexsp.htm (in Spanish)\nhttp://servicios.ideal.es/guia/abadia.html (in Spanish)\nhttp://granadainfo.com/canastera/cdesacroen.htm  (on the Romani caves)\nhttp://www.sacromontegranada.com/?lang=en Museum caves of the Sacromonte's website",

          "My family and I visited the Sacromonte Abbey. The place is perfect for a family activity, it has a lot to offer. You can either go walking or by car. Easy access and a enjoyable walk through sacromonte. ( we walked) You learn about the culture of the city with great views.",
          "I was surprised with the Abbey, I recommend your visit 100% for the amount of history that it keeps inside. A very nice staff and a wonderful guide, that made the visit super enjoyable.",
          "Abadia\u2019s guide was dynamic and fun! It is possible to arrive by car as you can find a paking close to it but do not miss to go by foot discovering a different lansacape of Granada and its charm corners on Albaycin area.",
          "I have been visiting Granada, Spain each summer for the past 12 years and thought I had seen it all. But there is so much to explore and this past summer found me at the Sacomonte Abbey. The Abbey is a delightful structure just a short drive from the center of Granada. Already",
          "We had booked a visit to the abbey and arrived a little late (the bus took longer than we thought). The woman on the desk was very unhelpful and wouldn't let us go on the next visit. Whilst it was our fault that we were late, the abbey's response didn't feel very flexible and",
          "We bought a pass for 5 monuments in Granada, Abadia del Sacromonte is one of them. This is the only place that requires pre-booking as it is a guided tour and places are limited. Having said that, it is not difficult to get a place, even a day before. The guide for the tour is",
          "We took the one-hour guided tour (in Spanish) and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our guide, Lidia, was fun, friendly, dynamic and very informative. The visit to the Abbey was really interesting (even my 15yo daughter was moderately interested!) and some of the artefacts were quite",
          "Bus C34 will drop you off a few meters from Sacramonte Abbey and 5\u20ac will get you a guided tour. We ended up here by accident but decided to join the tour not in our native language. Regardless, it was an enjoyable opportunity to view artifacts and visit the caves. The museum is",
          "Schedule your visit there. Go by public bus, it is cheap, avoiding to walk - I really like to walk, but the path is complicated - in a hill sometimes without good structure. There you have a very nice place and a good museum.",
          "We were hesitating to return to visit this abbey. There is no much information about what there is to see in this abbey. The view from the abbey overlooking down to the Alhambra was breathtaking, as well as the rick-a-dy caves on the hillside. I took the bus there and had to",
          "Abadia del Sacromonte is on the outskirts north of Granada. Walking there takes a long time and there is some steep climbing to do, but there is also a bus going there (number C34). I used the bus to reach the abbey, and I decided to walk back to town, and it was a good decision",
          "You see this building from all over the place and wonder what it is. It is worth the time and the walk. It took my breathe away that this was still functioning as an abbey and you could tour it. I am not catholic so it was very informative and the guided tour was excellent.it is",
          "Saw this as one of the places to see when visiting Granada. Caught the C34 bus up which is definitely an easier option. The tour runs at specific times and in specific languages so might be advisable to check ahead of schedule to save hanging around for hours. Actual tour was",
          "Unless you enjoy religious legends, skip the tour and go for the view. It\u2019s pleasant to walk around and look down on Granada and the Alhambra. I had hoped to learn about how the monks lived here, but the tour was mainly about the legends, the relics, and the founders of the",
          "Definately worth a cycle trip up there - on E bike of course due to the steep hill. Great views too.",
          "Huge old building, partly derelict. Opened at 4pm. The English tour is at certain times but we knew we had missed that slot, however the guide did her best to tell us the main points as well as speaking in Spanish and French. Hear about the books written on lead plates which",
          "We visited the Abby today. We walked up from Granada, the walk was good offering nice views of the Alhambra. Walk was a little steep, but if you like walking not to much of a problem. The issue i had was that we asked if they do a tour in English, the answer was \" yes both in",
          "We took a cab to this site. You can take a bus, but that only goes so Fay and you\u2019ll need to walk the rest of the way... and it\u2019s a steep climb! The tour was conducted in both Spanish and English. Beautiful antiquities and even passages through caves.",
          "This was a fun adventure to see the sunset from the top of Sacromonte. The bus ride up was easy enough, though a bit of a jaunt on narrow roads. We had some trouble getting back as the bus didn\u2019t come by again, though it should have still been running and it gets a bit spooky",
          "This is a bit off the beaten track, but well worth a visit. Recommend getting the C2 bus from Plaza Nueva as it goes right to the abbey. It\u2019s within walking distance of the town, but a very steep climb. Not for the faint heart- especially in the heat of summer! When you get",
          "Having walked up through the Arab quarter we decided to carry on to Sacromonte. The final climb up to the abbey was very steep. Late on a sunny April afternoon we managed it, but I wouldn't recommend it in July or August unless you are young and fit! We arrived at 5.15pm and",
          "If you are young fit and healthy then please walk here from the city. We took the bus, it is quit a short trip but gains a lot of height. The Abbey is lovely, ticket buys you a guided tour but numbers on each tour are limited. Although maintained in good condition we felt it was",
          "At the back of granadas Alhambra, way up,on the hill you will find this beautiful abbey high up past the caves where the gypsies still live in the hills, you will find this fascinating abbey. Worth the track without a doubt. Loved it . Amazing views",
          "We stumbled upon the Abbey on our way to the Albaizin area. Was a worthwhile detour as we also stopped and took some lovely scenic photos of the Alhambra in the distance on the way down the winding road to the Abbey.",
          "We took a morning bus as I really wanted to see this place. It was closed. So disappointed. No information anywhere for any visitors. It was a complete waste of the bus fares and our time. I understand that it is a cloistered monastery. But either they open or they don't.",
          "Its an uphill hike to get here... Important to know that the tour inside the abby is only in Spanish and so non-Spanish speakers miss quite a bit of info. Entrance is 4\u20ac (it doesn't say so at the door). The visit is short (about 30 min.) and feels a bit rushed. The view is",
          "Sacromonte Abbey - the complex has three main parts: the Abbey, the College and the Seminary. It is a very peaceful place with beautiful views on Alhabra, the Granada. We also went underground, below the abbey, down to the catacombs which lead to a couple of small chapels, and",
          "I decided to check out the Abbey since it was included with the Granada Card. It's a bit of trip (Take the C2 bus), and you end up in this quiet area outside of town. You then make your way to the entrance where you wait until your tour guide is available. Tours are supposed to",
          "The sacromonte Abbey is included in the Granadacard. You can only have a guided tour, which happen about every hour (excluding siesta) provided there is more than one person. I was the only person there to start with so I waited for somebody else to arrive! The tour is quite",
          "Maybe we were unlucky, but we ended up on a tour (the only one) which was all in Spanish. It cost \u20ac4 each and lasted at least 30 mins, but we had no idea what was been said. We tried to catch some words, but the guide spoke so fast that all the words flowed into one. The cave",
          "A beautiful abbey in a lovely setting. Contrary to other reviews, we got an English speaking guide. She also repeated what she said in Spanish, but while she was doing that you could study the artefacts. She really brought the place to life, although 45 mins was maybe 15 mins",
          "This is an interesting site and it is kind of amazing. Much of the building is not accessible and is actually falling apart. Still, there are areas, especially the caves and the small museum that are quite interesting. The legends around St Cecil are presented as facts, even",
          "I visited this site last weekend with my brother. it's is totally underrated, if you come to Granada you need to save a morning to go up the hill and visit the Sacromonte Abby. I didn't know that it was the first private university of Spain. It's museum is smaill but very",
          "At 30 - 45 min. walking from Calle Carrera del Darro, I found that this Monastery is a gem which is not put in value. Guided tours only in Spanish every 30 min. (check for the opening hours) through a museum, a chapel and caves. Magnificent architecture and paintings. The walk",
          "The walk up to the abbey through the Sacromonte area is attractive and scenic but steep. The abbey does guided tours for \u20ac,4 per person so don't pay an arm and a leg for your own tour. The abbey is interesting, particularly the underground caves, and the cloisters beautifully",
          "The walk to the abbey takes you through Sacromonte but fail to impress with the state of disrepair. It is puzzling to have grand places like Alhambra so well maintained and places like this left on its own. It was sad to see the smashed lights along the path up the abbey. Don't",
          "Street's dead end with surprise...abbey. Beutiful look to Granada city, Alhambra and mountains...late evening...chillout...with bike can be too fantastic trip...down from the highest point...",
          "Didn't go in as there appears to be only entry with a guide. But the trip there is worth the effort, took the taxi as some of the way is steep uphill. Views all around are spectacular, from the view across Granada and the Alhambra, round to the Sierra Nevada. Very pleasant",
          "I loved visiting this place as I love visiting most places in Spain. it has a good atmosphere and ambiance and is a must see when visiting Granada.",
          "We took the C2 bus out to the Abbey. It closes for a few hours at 1:30pm, but the last tour also starts at 1:30pm. It was about a 40 minute tour and you'll see some great art, ancient texts (both Christian and Muslim) and tour the catacombs.",
          "The Abbey is located at the top of Sacromonte hill. You have a half hour walk to arrive. The place houses the remains of San Cecilio, one of the early Christian martyrs of Granada and is a pilgrimage site. There is an abbey and a school at the place. You can get in with a guided",
          "To get away from all the crowds visit this (free) peaceful and scenic spot overlooking Granada. It is most beautiful inside and worth the steep climb ( or bus up and walk down!)",
          "We were lucky enough to be at the abbey for their last tour of the day at 1 PM. It was given in Spanish but we got enough out of the tour to enjoy ourselves. Very interesting place to visit.",
          "One of the areas with a splendid panoramic view. A beautiful garden; a peaceful place. It is worth walk all the way there.",
          "The abbey is situated outside Granada and Albaic\u00edn but thou easy to find, I recomend that you take the bus (Line C2) there and then walk home. It looks very big on the outside but only contain a fantastic courtyard, a nice museum, church and the caves. Its very intresting see",
          "Just had a great time going around the Abbey. The guided tour (it is only available by guided tour, for a very reasonable 4 euros) was presented by an extremely knowledgeable and engaging lady. She kindly translated the tour into English for the few of us who couldn't speak",
          "The guide was a great woman. She explained all the history of Granada in just an hour. She was a great communicator. There are a lot of pieces of art, such as, tapestry, first science books, paintings,....Hugely recommended and cheap! Arrive by bus from the city center and go",
          "What a surprise! After visiting many churches and religious sites for more than 60 Days around Spain, this is one of the best for the money spent and the services provided at the facility. Although it is difficult to find, it is a must see in Granada. The building although needs",
          "Quite hard to find but well worth it!! A hidden gem, with great views and very interesting history dating back to the Roman times. Fascinating to see the caves and the treasures that were found in them. Kids enjoyed walking through the caves and the books and artefacts dating",
          "We went taking the bus going to the Albayzin and continuing to the Sacromonte. It is difficult to reach this monastery but well worth seeing it because there are many interesting things to see there. The abbey has books made of lead that were written in Arabic and treated themes",
          "Although the Abbey has suffered a fire and the actual buildings are closed to the public. The outside of the buildings show a range of architecture, culture and religious influences. It is both a fascinating and peaceful place. From the back of the Abbey there are beautiful",
          "Great visit. The bus ride up through the Albaycin & Sacromonte is an adventure in itself. Once you arrive at the Abadia there are fantastic views of the Alhambra & central Granada. The guided tour of the Abadia is very informative and enjoyable. Our guide, Sonia, was great. She",
          "We walked on up from the cave museum in Sacramonte. A huge monastery from the early 17th century, some if it beginning to fall into disrepair. Very atmospheric and you feel out in the countryside but still with views of the Alhambra. As it was not open from 11-1 and 4-6, we did",
          "We took the 35 bus from plaza nueva to the monastery and for less than 2 euros each we had a fascinating trip through albbayzin and sacromonte to the monastery. It is only open from 11-1 and 4-6 so we didn't get to go in but the trip was still worth it for the views. We the",
          "A visit not to be missed. A great place to increase your understanding of the culture and local traditions.",
          "The Sacromonte means sacred mountain and there is a very interesting abbey there that can be reached by using the No. 34 bus from Plaza Nueva. Few people ever visit this abbey, but it is worth seeing. There were caves here and many people thought that in one of them they had"

        "wiki": "The Corral del Carb\u00f3n is a 14th-century monument located in the Spanish city of Granada (Andalusia). It is the only Nasrid alh\u00f3ndiga preserved in its entirety in the Iberian peninsula.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was built during the Nasrid reign before 1336, and his original name was Al-Funduq al-Gidida or New Alh\u00f3ndiga. Located south of the Muslim city, next to the silk market or Alcaicer\u00eda, to the souk of the Medina and to the Main Mosque, served as inn for merchants in transit, warehouse and wholesale market. A small bridge was called al-qantara al-yad\u00edda (new bridge) until 1501, and later puente del carb\u00f3n or puente del \u00c1lamo or puente de los Curtidores (qantarat al-Dabbayin), located on the Darro River communicated the Alh\u00f3ndiga with the souk. \nIn general, as described Leopoldo Torres Balb\u00e1s (Chronicles of Archaeology of Muslim Spain, XIX. Tomo 2. PP 235), this building responds to an Oriental model, but the decor and the details are distinctly Grenadian.  Its ancestry can be traced from the Greek agoras, through the later Roman horreum until Islamic times.  The monumental cover comes from the eastern iwan, whose origins have been much discussed, and is used in Sassanian palaces.  Transmission to the West would be through Egypt, where the entrance portico opened by a large arch, vaulted with moc\u00e1rabes, with the building's lintelled entrance door below, and a twin window above, is much used.  Examples include the Mosque of al-Zahir Baybars I in Cairo (665-1309) and the Gate of Justice in Alhambra in Granada (749-1348).\nIn 1494 the Catholic Monarchs granted it to Sancho de Arana.  At his death (1531) it came to auction, being used as hosting of coal merchants, later as corral de comedias (until 1593) and then as a tenement house.  It was declared a National Historic-Artistic Monument in 1918, but was threatened with demolition until it was acquired by the state in 1933, which commissioned its restoration to Leopoldo Torres Balb\u00e1s. In 1992 was again restored by the architect Rafael Soler M\u00e1rquez, although remained some flaws that were not corrected until another restoration. The facade was operated with treatments of cleaning and consolidation by the company Siglos Conservaci\u00f3n y Restauraci\u00f3n, s.l., under the direction of the restorers Lola Blanca L\u00f3pez and Lourdes Blanca L\u00f3pez. Intervention completed in November 2006.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe facade, richly decorated with plaster, is dominated by a large tumid arc (two centers and some shored) provided with alfiz. On its horizontal molding there a Kufic epigraphic decoration. A shaft on it, stands a geminare vain. It is topped by a large overhanging eaves supported by wooden corbels in the Nasrid tradition (Golden Room of the Alhambra).\nAfter the hall, covered with a vault of moc\u00e1rabes that retains some other polychromatic, it enter to the courtyard. This, of quadrangular plant, is functional without decorative excesses. In its center is a stone basin provided with two pipe stands.\nThe structure of the three floors provided of galleries that open to the courtyard is formed by stone pillars and beams and footings (the latter carved) of wood. Dickies factory is brick. The interior of the halls is very transformed to house shops and offices.\n\n\n== Current use ==\nIt currently houses the offices and personnel administration of City of Granada Orchestra, and is home to the International Festival of Music and Dance of Granada. It is also occasional stage in the courtyard, of theatrical performances, flamenco concerts and conferences.\n\n\n== External links ==\nEl Corral del Carb\u00f3n\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGranada in your hands.

          "This old area had been a place where Arab merchants met and was built in the 14th century. We passed through this as one of the many interesting places to see on our walking tour.",
          "This is one of the first inns where merchants visiting ancient Granada could stay for free. Worth a visit as part of a guided tour so its historic importance can be better understood. Not a lot to see if you are visiting7 by yourself.",
          "This is an ancient caravanerai and is an interesting spot to step into (through a beautifully carved archway) and take a look around. There is no admission fee, and we appreciated the shady overhangs on a hot day, but unless you know something of the history or have a guide",
          "This one of the old original sites that you can find in Granada, just come inside and feel it, the entrance is amazing and the fountain inside..",

          "Corral del Carbon could even be skipped while visiting Granada, since there is hardly anything to see - but on the other hand, it's very close to the Alcaiceria, and it only takes a couple of minutes to see it all. The portal is dominated by a nice tumid arc, but when you go",
          "While the building itself lacks information that informs of its wonderful historical significance it is still worth the visit. However, the small museum at the back is very informative regarding the history of Medina-Garnata.",
          "This building dates back to 14th century when it was a warehouse for merchandise and a lodging place for merchants. It is the best preserved building of its type in Spain. It later became a charcoal store (hence the name), a playhouse and a tenement before being restored. The",

          "Few of the caravansarays remained. This one survived because it was used for coal storage. Now it contains some offices. The caravansaray was an inn for merchants who came to the Alcaicer\u00eda across the road. They needed a safe place to Stable their animals, store their goods,",

        "wiki": "Granada ( gr\u0259-NAH-d\u0259, Spanish: [\u0261\u027ea\u02c8na\u00f0a]) , locally [\u0261\u027ea\u02c8na] is the capital city of the province of Granada, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. Granada is located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the confluence of four rivers, the Darro, the Genil, the Monachil and the Beiro. It sits at an average elevation of 738 m (2,421 ft) above sea level, yet is only one hour by car from the Mediterranean coast, the Costa Tropical. Nearby is the Sierra Nevada Ski Station, where the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 were held.\nIn the 2005 national census, the population of the city of Granada proper was 236,982, and the population of the entire urban area was estimated to be 472,638, ranking as the 13th-largest urban area of Spain. About 3.3% of the population did not hold Spanish citizenship, the largest number of these people (31%; or 1% of the total population) coming from South America. Its nearest airport is Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca Granada-Ja\u00e9n Airport.\nThe Alhambra, an Arab citadel and palace, is located in Granada. It is the most renowned building of the Islamic historical legacy with its many cultural attractions and architectural elements that make Granada a popular destination among the tourist cities of Spain. The Almohad influence on architecture is also preserved in the Granada neighborhood called the Albaic\u00edn with its fine examples of Moorish and Morisco construction.  Granada is also well-known within Spain for the University of Granada which has an estimated 82,000 students spread over five different campuses in the city.  The pomegranate (in Spanish, granada) is the heraldic device of Granada.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Umayyad history ===\n\nThe region surrounding what today is Granada has been populated since at least 5500 BC and experienced Roman and Visigothic influences. The most ancient ruins found in the city belong to an Iberian oppidum called Ilturir, in the region known as Bastetania. This oppidum eventually changed its name to Iliberri, and after the Roman conquest of Iberia, to Municipium Florentinum Iliberitanum.\n\n\n=== Founding and early history ===\n\nThe Umayyad conquest of Hispania, starting in AD 711, brought large parts of the Iberian Peninsula under Moorish control and established al-Andalus. Granada's historical name in the Arabic language was \u063a\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0629 (\u0120arn\u0101\u1e6dah). The word G\u00e1rnata (or Karnatah) possibly means \"hill of strangers\". Because the city was situated on a low plain and, as a result, difficult to protect from attacks, the ruler decided to transfer his residence to the higher situated area of G\u00e1rnata. According to Arabic sources Ilbira (Elvira) was razed during Fitna of al-Andalus, afterwards it was not restored at its previous place and instead Garnata, which was a Jewish ghetto before, replaced it as the main city. In a short time this town was transformed into one of the most important cities of al-Andalus.In the early 11th century, after the collapse of the Umayyad Caliphate, the Berber Zawi ben Ziri established an independent kingdom for himself, the Taifa of Granada. His surviving memoirs \u2013 the only ones for the Spanish \"Middle Ages\" \u2013 provide considerable detail for this brief period. The Zirid Taifa of Granada was a Jewish state in all but name; the Muslim king is looked upon as a mainly symbolic figurehead. It was the center of Jewish Sephardi culture and scholarship.\n\nEarly Arabic writers repeatedly called it \"Garnata al-Yahud\" (Granada of the Jews).... Granada was in the eleventh century the center of Sephardic civilization at its peak, and from 1027 until 1066 Granada was a powerful Jewish state. Jews did not hold the foreigner (dhimmi) status typical of Islamic rule. Samuel ibn Nagrilla, recognized by Sephardic Jews everywhere as the quasi-political ha-Nagid ('The Prince'), was king in all but name. As vizier he made policy and\u2014much more unusual\u2014led the army.... It is said that Samuel's strengthening and fortification of Granada was what permitted it, later, to survive as the last Islamic state in the Iberian peninsula.\nAll of the greatest figures of eleventh-century Hispano-Jewish culture are associated with Granada. Moses Ibn Ezra was from Granada; on his invitation Judah ha-Levi spent several years there as his guest. Ibn Gabirol\u2019s patrons and hosts were the Jewish viziers of Granada, Samuel ha-Nagid and his son Joseph.\nWhen Joseph took over after his father's death, he proved to lack his father's diplomacy, bringing on the 1066 Granada massacre, which ended the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain.\nBy the end of the 11th century, the city had spread across the Darro to reach the hill of the future Alhambra, and included the Albaic\u00edn neighborhood (now a World Heritage site). The Almoravids ruled Granada from 1090 and the Almohad dynasty from 1166.\n\n\n=== Nasrid dynasty\u2014Emirate of Granada ===\n\nIn 1228, with the departure of the Almohad prince Idris al-Ma'mun, who left Iberia to take the Almohad leadership, the ambitious Ibn al-Ahmar established the last and longest reigning Muslim dynasty in the Iberian peninsula, the Nasrids. With the Reconquista in full swing after the conquest of C\u00f3rdoba in 1236, the Nasrids aligned themselves with Fernando III of Castile, officially becoming the Emirate of Granada in 1238. Most historians agree that Granada became a tributary state to the Kingdom of Castile from that year, although this was often interrupted by wars between the two states. It provided connections with Muslim and Arab trade centers, particularly for gold from sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb, and exported silk and dried fruits produced in the area. The Nasrids also supplied troops from the Emirate and mercenaries from North Africa for service to Castile.\nIbn Battuta, a famous traveller and an authentic historian, visited the Kingdom of Granada in 1350. He described it as a powerful and self-sufficient kingdom in its own right, although frequently embroiled in skirmishes with the Kingdom of Castile. In his journal, Ibn Battuta called Granada the \"metropolis of Andalusia and the bride of its cities.\"During the Moor rule, Granada was a city with adherents to many religions and ethnicities (Arabs, Berbers, Christians and Jews) who lived in separate quarters. During this Nasrid period there were 137 Muslim mosques in the Medina (city) of Granada.\n\n\n=== Reconquista and the 16th century ===\n\nOn January 2, 1492, the last Muslim ruler in Iberia, Emir Muhammad XII of Granada, known as \"Boabdil\" to the Spanish, surrendered complete control of the Emirate of Granada to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, Los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos (\"the Catholic Monarchs\"), after the last battle of the Granada War.\nThe 1492 surrender of the Kingdom of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs is one of the most significant events in Granada's history as it marks the completion of the Reconquista. The terms of the surrender, expressed in the Alhambra Decree treaty, explicitly allowed the city's Muslim inhabitants, known as Mud\u00e9jars, to continue unmolested in the practice of their faith and customs. By 1499, however, Cardinal Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros grew frustrated with the slow pace of the efforts of the first archbishop of Granada, Hernando de Talavera, to convert non-Christians to Christianity and undertook a program of forced Christian baptisms, creating the Converso (convert) class for Muslims and Jews. Cisneros's new tactics, which were a direct violation of the terms of the treaty, provoked the Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1499\u20131501) centered in the rural Alpujarras region southwest of the city.\nResponding to the rebellion of 1501, the Castilian Crown rescinded the Alhambra Decree treaty, and mandated that Granada's Muslims convert or emigrate. Under the 1492 Alhambra Decree, Spain's Jewish population, unlike the Muslims, had already been forced to convert under threat of expulsion or even execution, becoming Marranos (meaning \"pigs\" in Spanish), or Catholics of Jewish descent. Many of the elite Muslim class subsequently emigrated to North Africa. The majority of the Granada's Mud\u00e9jar Muslims converted so that they could stay, however, becoming Moriscos, or Catholics of Moorish descent (\"Moor\" being equivalent to Muslim). Both populations of conversos were subject to persecution, execution, or exile, and each had cells that practiced their original religion in secrecy.\nOver the course of the 16th century, Granada took on an ever more Catholic and Castilian character, as immigrants came to the city from other parts of the Iberian Peninsula. The city's mosques were converted to Christian churches or completely destroyed. New structures, such as the cathedral and the Chanciller\u00eda, or Royal Court of Appeals, transformed the urban landscape. After the 1492 Alhambra decree, which resulted in the majority of Granada's Jewish population being expelled, the Jewish quarter (ghetto) was demolished to make way for new Catholic and Castilian institutions and uses.\n\n\n==== Legacy ====\n\nThe fall of Granada has a significant place among the important events that mark the latter half of the Spanish 15th century. It completed the so-called \"Reconquista\" (or Christian reconquest) of the almost 800-year-long Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula. Spain, now without any major internal territorial conflict, embarked on a great phase of exploration and colonization around the globe. In the same year, the sailing expedition of Christopher Columbus resulted in what is usually claimed to be the first European sighting of the New World, although Leif Erikson is often regarded as the first European to land in the New World, 500 years before Christopher Columbus. The resources of the Americas enriched the crown and the country, allowing Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand to consolidate their rule as Catholic Monarchs of the united kingdoms. Subsequent conquests, and the Spanish colonization of the Americas by the maritime expeditions they commissioned, created the vast Spanish Empire: for a time, the largest in the world.\n\n\n== Heritage and monuments ==\nThe greatest artistic wealth of Granada is its Spanish-Islamic art \u2013 in particular, the compound of the Alhambra and the Generalife. The Generalife is a pleasure palace with attached romantic gardens, remarkable both for its location and layout, as well as for the diversity of its flowers, plants and fountains. The Alhambra is the architectural culmination of the works of Nasrid art that were undertaken in the 13th and 14th centuries, with most of the Alhambra having been built at the time of Yusuf I and Mohammed V, between 1333 and 1354.\nAt present, the buildings of Granada are typically bourgeois in appearance, with much of the architecture dating from the 19th Century, together with numerous Renaissance and Baroque buildings.\n\n\n=== Alhambra ===\n\nThe Alhambra is a Nasrid \"palace city\". It was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1984. It is certainly Granada's most emblematic monument and one of the most visited in Spain. It consists of a defensive zone, the Alcazaba, together with others of a residential and formal state character, the Nasrid Palaces and, lastly, the palace, gardens and orchards of the Generalife.\nThe Alhambra occupies a small plateau on the southeastern border of the city in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada above the Assabica valley. Some of the buildings may have existed before the arrival of the Moors. The Alhambra as a whole is completely walled, bordered to the north by the valley of the Darro, to the south by the al-Sabika, and to the east of the Cuesta del Rey Chico, which in turn is separated from the Albaic\u00edn and Generalife, located in the Cerro del Sol.\nIn the 11th century the Castle of the Alhambra was developed as a walled town which became a military stronghold that dominated the whole city. But it was in the 13th century, with the arrival of the first monarch of the Nasrid dynasty, Muhammad I of Granada (Mohammed I, 1238\u20131273), that the royal residence was established in the Alhambra. This marked the beginning of its heyday. The Alhambra became palace, citadel and fortress, and was the residence of the Nasrid sultans and their senior officials, including servants of the court and elite soldiers (13th\u201314th centuries).\nIn 1492 the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabela, expelled the final Moors from the city of Granada. They established permanent residency in the Alhambra, and it was here that Christopher Columbus requested royal endorsement for his westward expedition that year.\nIn 1527 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor demolished part of the architectural complex to build the Palace which bears his name. Although the Catholic Monarchs had already altered some rooms of the Alhambra after the conquest of the city in 1492, Charles V wanted to construct a permanent residence befitting an emperor. Around 1537 he ordered the construction of the Peinador de la Reina, or Queen's dressing room, where his wife Isabel lived, over the Tower of Abu l-Hayyay.\n\nThere was a pause in the ongoing maintenance of the Alhambra from the 18th century for almost a hundred years, and during control by the First French Empire, substantial portions of the fortress were blown apart. The repair, restoration and conservation that continues to this day did not begin until the 19th century. The complex currently includes the Museum of the Alhambra, with objects mainly from the site of the monument itself and the Museum of Fine Arts.\n\n\n=== Generalife ===\n\nThe Generalife is a garden area attached to the Alhambra which became a place of recreation and rest for the Granadan Muslim kings when they wanted to flee the tedium of official life in the Palace. It occupies the slopes of the hill Cerro del Sol above the ravines of the Genil and the Darro and is visible from vantage points throughout the city. It was conceived as a rural village, consisting of landscaping, gardens and architecture. The palace and gardens were built during the reign of Muhammed III (1302\u20131309) and redecorated shortly after by Abu l-Walid Isma'il (1313\u20131324). It is of the Islamic Nasrid style, and is today one of the biggest attractions in the city of Granada. The Generalife was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984.\nIt is difficult to know the original appearance of the Generalife, as it has been subject to modifications and reconstructions throughout the Christian period which disfigured many of its former aspects. All buildings of the Generalife are of solid construction, and the overall decor is austere and simple. There is little variety to the Alhambra's decorative plaster, but the aesthetic is tasteful and extremely delicate. In the last third of the 20th century, a part of the garden was destroyed to build an auditorium.\n\n\n=== Cathedral ===\n\nThe cathedral of Granada is built over the Nasrid Great Mosque of Granada, in the centre of the city. Its construction began during the Spanish Renaissance in the early 16th century, shortly after the conquest of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs, who commissioned the works to Juan Gil de Honta\u00f1\u00f3n and Enrique Egas. Numerous grand buildings were built in the reign of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, so that the cathedral is contemporary to the Christian palace of the Alhambra, the University and the Real Chanciller\u00eda (Supreme Court).\nThe church was conceived on the model of the Cathedral of Toledo, for what initially was a Gothic architectural project, as was customary in Spain in the early decades of the 16th century. However, Egas was relieved by the Catholic hierarchy in 1529, and the continuation of the work was assigned to Diego Siloe, who built upon the example of his predecessor, but changed the approach towards a fully Renaissance aesthetic.The architect drew new Renaissance lines for the whole building over the gothic foundations, with an ambulatory and five naves instead of the usual three. Over time, the bishopric continued to commission new architectural projects of importance, such as the redesign of the main fa\u00e7ade, undertaken in 1664 by Alonso Cano (1601\u20131667) to introduce Baroque elements. In 1706 Francisco de Hurtado Izquierdo and later his collaborator Jos\u00e9 Bada built the current tabernacle of the cathedral.\nHighlights of the church's components include the main chapel, where may be found the praying statues of the Catholic Monarchs, which consists of a series of Corinthian columns with the entablature resting on their capitals, and the vault over all. The spaces of the walls between the columns are perforated by a series of windows. The design of the tabernacle of 1706 preserves the classic proportions of the church, with its multiple columns crossing the forms of Diego de Silo\u00e9.\n\n\n=== Royal Chapel ===\n\nThe Catholic Monarchs chose the city of Granada as their burial site by a royal decree dated September 13, 1504. The Royal Chapel of Granada, built over the former terrace of the Great Mosque, ranks with other important Granadan buildings such as the Lonja and the Catedral e Iglesia del Sagrario. In it are buried the Catholic Monarchs, their daughter Joanna of Castile (Juana la Loca) and her husband Felipe I (Felipe el Hermoso). Construction of the Chapel started in 1505, directed by its designer, Enrique Egas. Built in several stages, the continuing evolution of its design joined Gothic construction and decoration with Renaissance ideals, as seen in the tombs and the 17th and 18th century Granadan art in the Chapel of Santa Cruz. Over the years the church acquired a treasury of works of art, liturgical objects and relics.\nThe Royal Chapel was declared a Historic Artistic Monument on May 19, 1884, taking consideration of BIC (Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural) status in the current legislation of Spanish Historical Heritage (Law 16/1985 of 25 June). The most important parts of the chapel are its main retable, grid and vault. In the Sacristy-Museum is the legacy of the Catholic Monarchs. Its art gallery is highlighted by works of the Flemish, Italian and Spanish schools.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Albayz\u00edn ===\n\nThe Albayz\u00edn (or Albaic\u00edn) is a neighborhood of Al-Andalus origin, much visited by tourists who flock to the city because of its historical associations, architecture, and landscape.\nThe archeological findings in the area show that it has been inhabited since ancient times. It became more relevant with the arrival of the Zirid dynasty, in 1013, when it was surrounded by defensive walls. It is one of the ancient centres of Granada, like the Alhambra, the Realejo and the Arrabal de Bib-Rambla, in the flat part of the city. Its current extension runs from the walls of the Alcazaba to the cerro of San Miguel and on the other hand, from the Puerta de Guadix to the Alcazaba.\nThis neighborhood had its greatest development in the Nasrid era, and therefore largely maintains the urban fabric of this period, with narrow streets arranged in an intricate network that extends from the upper area, called San Nicol\u00e1s, to the river Darro and Calle Elvira, located in the Plaza Nueva. The traditional type of housing is the carmen granadino, consisting of a free-standing house surrounded by a high wall that separates it from the street and includes a small orchard or garden.\nIn the Muslim era the Albayz\u00edn was characterized as the locus of many revolts against the caliphate. At that time it was the residence of craftsmen, industrialists and aristocrats. With the Christian reconquest, it would progressively lose its splendor. The Christians built churches and settled there the Real Chanciller\u00eda. During the rule of Felipe II of Spain, after the rebellion and subsequent expulsion of the Moors, the district was depopulated. In 1994 it was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site. Of its architectural wealth among others include the Ziri walls of the Alcazaba Cadima, the Nasrid walls, the towers of the Alcazaba, the churches of Salvador (former main mosque), San Crist\u00f3bal, San Miguel Alto and the Real Chanciller\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Sacromonte ===\n\nThe Sacromonte neighbourhood is located on the Valpara\u00edso hill, one of several hills that make up Granada. This neighborhood is known as the old neighbourhood of the Romani, who settled in Granada after the conquest of the city. It is one of the most picturesque neighborhoods, full of whitewashed caves cut into the rock and used as residences. The sound of strumming guitars may still be heard there in the performance of flamenco cantes and quej\u00edos, so that over time it has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in Granada.\nAt the top of this hill is the Abbey of Sacromonte and the College of Sacromonte, founded in the 17th century by the then Archbishop of Granada Pedro de Castro. The Abbey of Sacromonte was built to monitor and guard the alleged relics of the evangelists of Baetica. Those are of questionable authenticity, but since their finding the area has been a religious pilgrimage destination.The abbey complex consists of the catacombs, the abbey (17th\u201318th centuries), the Colegio Viejo de San Dionisio Areopagita (17th century) and the Colegio Nuevo (19th century). The interior of the church is simple and small but has numerous excellent works of art, which accentuate the size and rich carving of the Crucificado de Risue\u00f1o, an object of devotion for the Romani people, who sing and dance in the procession of Holy Week. The facilities also include a museum, which houses the works acquired by the Foundation.\n\n\n=== Charterhouse ===\n\nThe Charterhouse of Granada is a monastery of cloistered monks, located in what was a farm or Muslim almunia called Aynadamar (\"fountain of tears\") that had an abundance of water and fruit trees. The initiative to build the monastery in that place was begun by Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, known as El Gran Capit\u00e1n. The charterhouse was founded in 1506; construction started ten years later, and continued for the following 300 years.\nThe Monastery suffered heavy damage during the Peninsular War and lost considerable property in 1837 as a result of the confiscations of Mendiz\u00e1bal. Currently, the monastery belongs to the Carthusians, reporting directly to the Archdiocese of Granada.The street entrance to the complex is an ornate arch of Plateresque style. Through it one reaches a large courtyard, at the end which is a wide staircase leading to the entrance of the church. The church, of early 16th century style and plan, has three entrances, one for the faithful and the other two for monks and clergy. Its plan has a single nave divided into four sections, highlighting the retables of Juan S\u00e1nchez Cot\u00e1n and the chancel's glass doors, adorned with mother-of-pearl, silver, rare woods and ivory. The presbytery is covered by elliptical vaulting. The main altar, between the chancel arch and the church tabernacle, is gilded wood.\nThe church's tabernacle and sancta sanctorum are considered a masterpiece of Baroque Spanish art in its blend of architecture, painting and sculpture. The dome that covers this area is decorated with frescoes by the C\u00f3rdoba artist Antonio Palomino (18th century) representing the triumph of the Church Militant, faith, and religious life.\nThe courtyard, with galleries of arches on Doric order columns opening on it, is centered by a fountain. The Chapter House of Legos is the oldest building of the monastery (1517). It is rectangular and covered with groin vaulting.Mosque of Granada\nThe Mosque of Granada was inaugurated in 2003 on the summit of the neighborhood of Albayzin. The mosque was built near the Church of San Salvador and the Church of San Nicol\u00e1s. The Church of San Salvador was built on the site of the Great Mosque of Albayzin. The Society for the Return of Islam in Spain purchased the site in 1981, but it took many years for the plans to be approved. The mosque's initial funding was supplied by Shaykh 'Abdalqadir as-Sufi al-Murabit who envisioned providing Granada's new Spanish Muslim community with a mosque. Additional funding came from Malaysia, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. In 1991 the CIE (Comunidad Isl\u00e1mica en Espa\u00f1a) hired the architect Renato Ramirez Sanchez to design the mosque. In the 1990s, there was a heated debate pertaining to the design of the minaret. Construction eventually began in 2001. The mosque now serves about 500 people.\n\n\n=== Palace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar ===\nThe Palace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar was built in one of the most emblematic streets of Granada, the Carrera del Darro, at number 5. This place is an architectural example of the classical Granada during the Renaissance transformation of the XVIth century. It was built by the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar, great-grandson of both Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez del Pulgar (known by the name of El de la Haza\u00f1as [The One of the Valiant Deeds]) and Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (El Gran Capit\u00e1n [The Great Captain]), Captain-General of the Castilian-Aragonese forces that concluded the Reconquest of the peninsula. The palace is now the museum of perfumes El Patio de los Perfumes, with 1,500 square metres (16,000 sq ft) of floor space on two floors and 130 square metres (1,400 sq ft) of patio to relax surrounded by flowers and perfumes.\n\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nMonasterio de San Jer\u00f3nimo: monastery\nSan Juan de Dios Hospital\nCastril Palace\nMuseo de Bellas Artes de Granada\nMadrasah of Granada\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area of Granada ===\nGranada's metropolitan area consists of about fifty municipalities and the capital. Although it is not formally constituted as a political and administrative body, there are several public services that are combined. The arrival of many inhabitants of the capital and other towns in the province, influences a large Population growth. Despite the fact that the capital loses inhabitants, who move to neighboring towns. The main causes of the exodus towards the towns of the metropolitan area are, mainly, the difficulty of accessing a home in the capital because of the high prices it has and labor reasons, because in the towns of the periphery the majority are being located of industrial estates.\n\n\n=== Capital of Granada Province ===\nThe city of Granada is the capital of the province of the same name, thus all administrative entities of provincial scope dependent on the regional government and the state are located there. There is a provincial delegation from each of the governmental departments to the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, coordinated by a government delegate under the Ministry of the Interior. The national government of Spain has a sub-delegation in Granada, subordinate to the government delegate in the autonomous community.\n\n\n=== Judicial administration ===\nThe headquarters of the Superior Court of Justice of Andalusia, Ceuta and Melilla is in Granada, located in Plaza Nueva, in the building of the historic Royal Chancery, as well as the Superior Prosecutor's Office of Andalusia, located in the building of the Bank of Spain. It has a Provincial Court, located in Corteza del Carmen Street, and is also head of the Judicial Party No. 3 of the province, whose demarcation includes the city and 49 towns, some of them very populated, in the metropolitan area region.\nMost of the courts are located in two administrative buildings, in Plaza Nueva and Avenida del Sur. The set of judicial bodies is as follows: \n\nSuperior Court of Justice: President. Civil-Criminal Chamber. Contentious-Administrative Room. Social room.\nProvincial Court: President. Criminal: 2; Civil: 3\nCourts\n\n\n=== Municipal organization ===\nIts political administration is carried out through a City Council, of democratic management, whose components are chosen every four years by universal suffrage. The electoral roll is composed of all residents registered in Granada over 18 years of age, of Spanish nationality and of the other member countries of the European Union. According to the provisions of the General Electoral Regime Law, which establishes the number of eligible councilors according to the population of the municipality, the Municipal Corporation of Granada is made up of 27 councilors. In the municipal elections held in 2019 the constitution of the City Council was eleven councilors belonging to the Popular Party, eight to the Socialist Party, four belonging to Citizens Party, three to Vamos, Granada and one to the United Left-Socialist Alternative-For the People. After these results with the rise of the new political forces, PP and PSOE lost power; and after negotiations an agreement was reached with which Jos\u00e9 Torres Hurtado, mayor of the Popular Party, continues as mayor, under the supervision of the regeneration compliance required by the Citizens party. After his resignation, due to his involvement in Operation Serrallo / Nazar\u00ed, the socialist Francisco Cuenca was appointed mayor.\n\n\n=== Municipal districts and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Granada consists of eight districts whose population is distributed in the attached chart according to the 2009 census of the City of Granada. These districts formed a set of 36 neighborhoods. All boundaries of districts and neighborhoods were modified in February 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal service areas ===\nThe municipal government team has organized the distribution of management responsibilities, structuring itself in the following service areas: Weddings and Palaces, Equal opportunities, Economy, Education, Communication office, Unified license management, Youth, Environment, Municipal Office of Consumer Information, Citizen Participation, Group of Civil Protection Volunteers, Local Police.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n\n=== Realejo ===\nRealejo was the Jewish district in the time of the Nasrid Granada. (The centuries since the Jewish population were so important that Granada was known in Al-Andalus under the name of \"Granada of the Jews\", Arabic: \u063a\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648\u062f\u200e Gharn\u0101\u1e6dah al-Yah\u016bd.) It is today a district made up of many Granadinian villas, with gardens opening onto the streets, called Los C\u00e1rmenes.\n\n\n=== Cartuja ===\nThis district contains the Carthusian monastery of the same name: Cartuja. This is an old monastery started in a late Gothic style with Baroque exuberant interior decorations. In this district also, many buildings were created with the extension of the University of Granada.\n\n\n=== Bib-Rambla ===\nThe toponym derives from a gate (Bab al-Ramla, or the Gate of the Ears) that was built when Granada was controlled by the Nasrid dynasty. Nowadays, Bib-Rambla is a high point for gastronomy, especially in its terraces of restaurants, open on beautiful days. The Arab bazaar (Alcaicer\u00eda) is made up of several narrow streets, which start from this place and continue as far as the cathedral\n\n\n=== Sacromonte ===\n\nThe Sacromonte neighborhood is located on the extension of the hill of Albaic\u00edn, along the Darro River. This area, which became famous by the nineteenth century for its predominantly Gitano inhabitants, is characterized by cave houses, which are dug into the hillside. The area has a reputation as a major center of flamenco song and dance, including the Zambra Gitana, an Andalusian dance originating in the Middle East. The zone is a protected cultural environment under the auspices of the Centro de Interpretaci\u00f3n del Sacromonte, a cultural center dedicated to the preservation of Gitano cultural forms.\n\n\n=== Zaid\u00edn ===\n\nThis formerly blue collar but now upmarket neighborhood houses 100,000 residents of Granada, making it the largest neighborhood or 'barrio'. Traditionally populated by Romani people, now many residents are from North and West Africa, China, and many South American countries. Every Saturday morning it hosts a large outdoor market or \"mercadillo\", where many people come and sell their wares of fruits and vegetables, clothes and shoes, and other odds and ends.\n\n\n== Gastronomy ==\nThe gastronomy of Granada is part of the Arabic-Andalusian cuisine tradition, with a strong Arab and Jewish heritage, which is reflected in its condiments and spices, such as cumin, coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon, raisins, almonds or honey. The writer Miguel Alcobendas, author of the traditional cuisine of Granada, says that it has its origin in living together, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century (when Granada surrendered to the Catholic Kings), of Muslims, Jews and Christians in the Nasrid Kingdom from Granada. Subsequently there was a miscegenation with the kitchen of the Christians, in which the pork acquired an importance in the kitchen of Granada more than in the rest of Spain, since its consumption allowed its eaters to demonstrate a certain distance from the persecuted religions, since both Muslims and Jews have it banned.\nThe climatic differences of the different regions of the province, from the coast to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada propitiates a great variety of raw materials: vegetables], meats and sausages, fish that are combined in a multitude of dishes and recipes for soups and stews.\nThe famous and reputed Trev\u00e9lez ham comes from the Sierra of Granada, to which other pork derivatives are added, sausages such as chorizo, black pudding and pork tenderloin.\nHam and beans, two products of the land, are combined in one of its most typical dishes, beans with ham; Other known dishes are the Sacromonte tortilla, which among other ingredients must have cooked brains and veal crustaillas, chopped and sauted before mixing with the egg. It is also worth mentioning \"papas a lo pobre\", potatoes which are usually served with egg and fried peppers, as well as with pieces of pork or ham.\nAmong the stews and potajes, the pot of San Ant\u00f3n stands out, which is eaten mainly towards the second half of January; cabbage stew, which combines vegetables and legumes; the stew of green beans and fennel; The thistle and pumpkin casserole, with noodles and aromatic herbs, or gypsy pottery are other dishes of the land. \nConfectionery is well represented in the gastronomy of Granada, for sweets prepared by the nuns can be purchased in the numerous convents of the city: the pesti\u00f1os of V\u00e9lez or those of the Encarnaci\u00f3n, the puff pastries of San Jer\u00f3nimo, the moles of San Ant\u00f3n eggs, the Zafra biscuit, sweet potato rolls, cocas, roscos from Santo Tomas and mantecados. Aljoj\u00e1banas, honey and cheese dumplings and some of the fritters called almohados, as well as fig bread, Moorish roscos and an almond cake called soy\u00e1 are all of Arabic heritage. \nUnlike in other provinces of Andalusia, in Granada tapas (appetizers or snacks) are usually free in bars and restaurants. \"Bar hopping\" (Ir de tapas) and eating tapas in the time between finishing work and having dinner is a deeply rooted traditional activity among the people of Granada. There are different tapas routes around the city.\n\n\n== Leisure and entertainment ==\nIn Granada there is a wide program of leisure and entertainment, which covers a large number of fields, available to both visitors and citizens themselves. Of the leisure activities carried out, the following can be highlighted: \n\nThe zambras of Sacromonte. Old bridal parties held by the gypsies of the city, and that disappeared for years before their current vindication. They develop in the caves of the Sacromonte neighborhood and have a unique character in the world of flamenco. There are also more classic flamenco shows in the Albaic\u00edn. These flamenco shows, usually linked to restaurants, are one of the city's cultural attractions.\nFestivals. Granada has a very complete range of events: International Music and Dance Festival, International Jazz Festival, Granada Festival South Cinemas and International Tango Festival, among others.\nConcerts.

        "wiki": "The Court of the Lions (Spanish: Patio de los Leones; Arabic: \u0628\u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0627\u0639\u200e)  is the main courtyard of the Nasrid dynasty Palace of the Lions, in the heart of the Alhambra, the Moorish citadel formed by a complex of palaces, gardens and forts in Granada, Spain. It was commissioned by the Nasrid sultan Muhammed V of the Emirate of Granada in Al-Andalus. Its construction started in the second period of his reign, between 1362 and 1391 AD. The site is now part of the UNESCO World Heritage List and minted in Spain's 2011 limited edition of 2 \u20ac Commemorative Coins.\n\n\n== Background and architectural influences ==\nThe Palace of the Lions, as well as the rest of the other new rooms built under Muhammad V, like the Mexuar or Cuarto Dorado, represented the beginning of a new style, an exuberant mixture of Moorish and Christian influences that has been called Nasrid style. During the period that Muhammad V was ousted as sultan of Granada by his stepbrother, Abu-l Walid Ismail, he discovered in exile a host of new aesthetic influences that were not in the language of his predecessors, not even in his own first contributions to the enrichment of the Nasrid palaces of the Alhambra. In Fes he saw the Almoravid mosque of Qarawiyyin, built by Moroccan architects. The splendor of the decorations, specially the profuse use of the muqarnas that had once decorated the palaces and mosques of Al-\u00c1ndalus, stunned the ex-sultan, as did the ruins of the Roman city of Volubilis, where he could directly examine the classical orders, Roman ornamentation and, above all, the disposition of the Roman impluvium; the Roman ruins at Volubilis were particularly well preserved since they had been abandoned for a period of time in the Middle Ages and later re-used as a necropolis.Muhammad became an ally of his personal friend, the Christian king Pedro I of Castile, who helped him to regain the throne and defeat the usurpers. Meanwhile, he was also astonished with the construction of the palace of Pedro I, the Alc\u00e1zar of Seville, built in Mud\u00e9jar style by architects from Toledo, Seville and Granada. The influence of this Mud\u00e9jar style of King Pedro in the future Palace of the Lions was going to be decisive, especially the structure and disposition of the Qubba rooms along two axis of the 'Patio de las Doncellas' (\"Courtyard of the Maidens\").\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Courtyard of the Lions is an oblong courtyard, 35 m  in length and 20 m in width, surrounded by a low gallery supported on 124 white marble columns. A pavilion projects into the courtyard at each extremity, with filigree walls and light domed roof, elaborately ornamented. The square is paved with coloured tiles, and the colonnade with white marble; while the walls are covered 1.5 m up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles, with a border above and below enamelled blue and gold. The columns supporting the roof and gallery are irregularly placed, with a view to artistic effect; and the general form of the piers, arches and pillars is most graceful.  They are adorned by varieties of foliage, etc.; above each arch there is a large square of arabesques; and over the pillars is another square of filigree work.  In the center of the courtyard is the celebrated Fountain of Lions, a magnificent alabaster basin supported by the figures of twelve lions in white marble.  At present, the fountain is under restoration in an effort to preserve its integrity.\nIt has been argued by Georges Mar\u00e7ais that the spacing of columns and arches was set to the golden ratio, but there is no strong evidence that Muslim architects ever used it. Instead, as Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez-Puertas postulates, the rectangles used in the construction may have been based on square roots and surds.\n\n\n== Meaning of the structure ==\nThe structure of the courtyard, has, as it has been said, a direct influence of the Sevillian Patio de las Doncellas, but its meaning and origins trace their roots to early Islamic gardening, the courtyard divided in four parts, each one of them symbolizing one of the four parts of the world. Each part is irrigated by a water channel that symbolize the four rivers of Paradise. This courtyard is, therefore, an architectural materialization of Paradise, where the gardens, the water, and the columns form a conceptual and physical unity. The slender column forest have been said to represent the palm trees of an oasis in the desert, deeply related with Paradise in the Nasrid imagination. In the poem of Ibn Zamrak on the basin of the fountain, a further meaning is stated clearly: \"The fountain is the Sultan, which smothers with his graces all his subjects and lands, as the water wets the gardens.\"\nNowadays the flower garden has been substituted by a dry garden of pebbles, in order not to affect the foundation of the palace with the watering. In Nasrid times, the floor of the quartered planting beds was slightly lower than the general level, and the visual effect was like a tapestry of flowers, as the top of the plants were cut to the same level of the courtyard, and these were carefully chosen to cover a host of color nuances.\n\n\n== Lion Fountain ==\n\nSome research suggests that the 11th century lions of the Lion Fountain came from the house of the Jewish vizier Yusuf ibn Nagrela (d. 1066). It is not known if they were made before his death, and at the time, he was accused of wanting to build a bigger palace than the king's. They are large for sculptures of animals in Islamic art, but as in other sites of al-Andalus such as the earlier Medina Azahara near Cordoba, there are multiple animals. The Pisa Griffin is even larger.\nThere is an almost exact description of the original fountain, written by the poet Ibn Gabirol in the 11th century.  They represent the 12 tribes of Israel, two of them have a triangle on the forehead, indicating the two extant tribes Jud\u00e1 and Lev\u00ed. The Lions were removed in 2007 for restoration on the premises while the fountain was restored in situ. The lions were put back in place in July 2012 after reconstruction of the traditional water flow system of the Court of the Lions.\n\n\n=== Excerpt of Ibn Zamrak's poem on the basin ===\nThe poet and minister Ibn Zamrak wrote a poem to describe the beauty of the courtyard. It is carved around the rim of the basin:\n\n\n== References ==\nRobert Irwin, The Alhambra, ISBN 978-1-86197-487-7, 2005\nManzano Martos, Rafael.

          "We were recommended to go to the de gallo flamenco, but didn\u2019t want the long walk in the evening, and after seeing this place on TripAdvisor, decided to book dinner and show for 49 euros per person. We weren\u2019t disappointed. The dinner was lovely, staff were really attentive and",
          "This was my first Flamenco experience and I loved it. It is near alhambra and I bought the ticket without dinner for 18 euros. I booked for the last show which starts from 9 pm and the room is open from 8:30 pm. You can go there early if you want to get a good seat. The artists",
          "I am a real fan of Flamenco. I attended a Flamenco show at the Casa del Arte de Flamenco and it was excellent; very authentic and of high quality. There were a male dancer, a great guitar player, a singer and two female dancers. The venue holds only 60 people thus the show was",
          "We were visiting Granada for one night and after much research decided to book a dinner and show at Casa del Arte Flamenco. Dinner was lovely as we enjoyed a 3 course meal and the show was out of this world! Everyone participating in the show from the guitarist to the dancers",
          "We have seen Flamenco in Seville and this was as good, if not even better. Very traditional with a modern twist. We loved it and would recommend this venue.",
          "We really enjoyed Casa del Arte. I can't believe the energy the two dancers put into their performance. The vocalist and guitarist were awesome. Best seats are in the front so you can focus on their footwork. Would definitely go again!",
          "We booked for the New Year performance followed by a gourmet 11 course meal. Both were great, the flamenco being particularly forceful. After the meal staff and diners gathered by the stage for champagne and the Spanish tradition of eating 12 grapes as the clock chimed.",
          "Visiting my sister in Spain we took our 6 year old niece along to a performance this evening and she loved it! She\u2019s currently learning Flamenco and we hoped she would enjoy the show but she found the guitarist and both flamenco dancers breathtaking! Thank you for making her",
          "This was our second flamenco show during our stay in Granada, and we loved it. This show is more formal than the show we saw in Sacromonte. It's on an actual stage rather than in a cave, so it's a different experience. The performance was absolutely beautiful from the dancing",
          "The flamenco show was fabulous! The singers were great, and the dancing was passionate and fierce. We absolutely enjoyed it and would recommend everyone to see the show.",
          "My wife and I had a great experience upon arrival with the hostess who was extremely kind and nice. She was from PUerto Rico. Everything was punctual, and an extremely well done performance by the dancers.",
          "Wow! If I could give these guys 10 stars I would! Not only amazing artistry but the athletic endurance it takes to put on this performance is astounding! I was so inspired and energized by these gifted artists because, on a rainy Wednesday night in November, the audience",
          "Extremely moving performance from incredible artists! Full of passion, skill and filled with spirit. An intimate setting, you feel you are a part of the performance. A great value as well. Don't leave Granada without seeing this show. My spouse and I have been to other also",
          "This performance was a lot of fun, particularly the male dancer, who had me smiling & laughing throughout the performance. We had trouble buying tickets online, so stopped by the venue to get tickets in advance; although this was probably not necessary on a Sunday night in the",
          "My girlfriend is a fan of flamenco and during a visit to Granada we attended a show here. I really had little idea of what to expect, but was captivated by my first experience of the art form. As a classical musician, I guess the guitar playing was what I could appreciate best,",
          "If you have the chance to go see a flamenco dance here please do. It was amazing and beautiful. Would definitely go back again.",
          "I have spent a lot of time over the past few years and have visited many of the tablaos. Contrary to what most guides will tell you, the best places to see Flamenco are in the city centre. Sacromonte is an interesting location, but a bit touristy. In Casa del Arte you get",
          "Wonderful guitar, singing and dancing. Small cast of 4, in a small room with about 30 chairs. Highly recommend..",
          "Entire family enjoyed a spectacular show in the small, intimate setting. A layered experience of guitar, singing, castanets, clapping & amazing dancing. Ages in our group ranged from 7 - 74 and we all really enjoyed it. One of our favorite highlights from our trip to Spain.",
          "Highly recommend this flamenco show. Fantastic artists and some of the best singing and guitar we have seen in all of Spain. We thank Pilar for recommending this to us. It was an intimate venue and we enjoyed it very much. Worth a visit when you are in Granada.",
          "For my birthday my husband treated me to a wonderful evening here. We started the evening with a fantastic gourmet meal upstairs in the restaurant, the food was top quality, the staff were attentive, welcoming and knowledgeable. They knew that we were attending the flamenco show",
          "The performance was completely engaging for an hour, and the dancers, guitarist and singer all very talented. The establishment seemed like a tourist trap at first, but one of the local guides recommended it if we could not get to the flamenco performances in the caves in",
          "I loved the flamenco show that we saw. It felt very true and authentic. It was passionate and mesmerizing and exactly the right length! I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good flamenco show!",
          "Entertaining, energetic and fun for an hour. It is a very small stage with theatre seating and most seats have a good view, although doors open 30 mins before the show (queuing starts even earlier), seats are not reserved, and do fill up very quickly. The four performers (two",
          "This is the second time in 3 years that we have visited the Casa del Arte de Flamenco and before going we were wondering whether the show would be as good as the last time.We were not disappointed because we were treated to an outstanding performance.We watched a group of",
          "Fantastic!! Amazing, innovative food with vegetarian options, three course meal, bread and a drink as part of the deal. Then we saw the 21:00-22:00 flamenco show. The dancers, guitarist and singer were phenomenal. Highly recommended.",
          "A very good show with excellent dancers. The guitarist and the accompanying singer were amazing. Highly recommend this show staged in an intimate theatre setting.",
          "What an intense and passionate show! Great dancers, singer, and probably the best guitar playing we heard during our time in Spain. Loved it!",
          "This is set in a very small theatre like setting, however we found the performance captivating, particularly the singer and female dancer. The small area actually made the performance more intimate. The only small problem we had, was we called there on the afternoon of the",

          "Fabulous !!! We have visited multiple times, and the performances actually get better and better ( hard to imagine possible, when so good, but it is true) The artistes clearly build and build on their evident experience. Superb flamenco - singer, guitar, dancers, all combine",
          "This show is a must see - it was absolutely beautiful. My two children loved it, each artist was mesmerising in their own way and they really captivated everyone in our family. It is easy to get tickets for and easy to find the venue. They have 2 shows per night and each show is",
          "Attened the other night with my husband and we were blown away with the quality of the show. While it is seated as a tourist show the guitarist, signer and dancers all truly know their craft. Best of all it was genuine and you could tell they all really loved what they did.",
          "Great place to see to start the evening. Great experience and the performance was very enjoyable. After the dance we went upstairs and enjoyed a dinner with fantastic ambience",
          "Went last night. Simply amazing and powerful performances! I didn't understand a single word but the emotions and intensity the singer, guitarist, and the flamenco dancers say it all. It is evident that they love what they do based on their body language, the facial",
          "We went to the 9 o\u2019clock show at this small and intimate venue. Everyone seems to get a good view of the raised stage and the dancers\u2019 fast moving feet. The singer has a strong and powerful voice and he and the guitarist were excellent. The two dancers were emotional, passionate",
          "Saw the show on 18th September. It was truly amazing. All 4 performers were of the highest quality with their own distinctive styles. Both dancers were spectacular in their owm individual styles. The guitarost and singer wete top notch Amazing to see such quality in a small",
          "Wow, what a show. First time to watch Flamenco dancing, this is a small venue with four performers and they created an incredible intensive atmosphere.",
          "If you like flamenco, then this is a place for you. The reservations and ticketing are seamless. The entrance and seating went smoothly. The music and dancing was great... not exactly our thing, but it was a great way to see another culture. I would recommend to see this at",
          "First time seeing flamenco and it was a very enjoyable experience. The combination of the guitarist, singer and male and female dancer worked very well. Nice small venue where most seats have a good view of the stage. No photography allowed until the last few minutes. The guitar",
          "This small venue put on a world class show. The four performers (guitarist, singer, male and female dancers) were outstanding, and created an atmosphere of incredible intensity of emotion, reinforced by their superb technical abilities. This is a show not to be missed.The",
          "These artists are professionals! You can tell they put their hearts and souls into their crafts. We all enjoyed the show immensely. The only change I would make is to have the male and female dancers interact together more. They each danced quite a bit, but separately. They did",
          "Incredibly good flamenco. Best I\u2019ve seen in years. Earthy and vibrant. We came with our 2 disabled sons. Totally accessible and very welcoming. Truly appreciated. Really lovely show. Would totally recommend",
          "Yes this was for tourists. The four performers put on a real show. They each had a starring role in at least one of the performances. Started with the virtuoso guitarist and singer. Then the beautiful gipsy woman flamenco dancer who looked the part and was a real star. She",
          "The Flamenco show was really nice. The theater is small and intimate. All the performers delivered a memorable performance. The guitarist was my favorite. I recommend this show if you are looking for an authentic Flamenco show while you are in Granada.",
          "Its simple ,authentic and professional place to finish the day in Granada with flamingo show.it lasted about an hour with some Andalucian music and dancing.We just there for the show not the dinner.The hall is small but cozy and air conditioned.Close to the Alhambra Palace.",
          "Show was good, maybe they need a little bit more typical andalusian songs & show more traditional performances ;the restaurant was the cherry on the top, delicious food, desserts & spaniard wines. Super nice service and food, Jose Felix, the waiter made the dinner a really good",
          "Small venue with real performers and performances. Felt incredibly close to the show. In an ideal world a little more interpretation would have been useful. None of us know enough about Flamenco.",
          "The perfect intimate venue for an hour of incredible guitar, voice and dance!! Such passion! We were absolutely blown away by the talent of the performers. They really did give it their all! Highly recommend if you want to experience Flamenco but don\u2019t want all the touristy",
          "We discovered this place by accident and it was really suprise for us. Dancer Cristina Aguilera was totally awesome, she was star of the night for me and I would love to see her again, cause her dance as full of emotions. Thank you for this experience.",
          "Excellent flamenco show in small, intimate surroundings. We thoroughly enjoyed all the performances - singer, guitarist and dancers.",
          "As this was the first time we have ever watched a flamenco show, the experience was rewarding and awe-inspiring. As it was a small place, we were up and close with the performers, who performed beautifully. The show was excellent and unique; it was clear that the performers",
          "An amazing hour long show of skill and passion. It was not 'touristy' and we really enjoyed it. We were able to book and pay online before leaving UK. Appreciated the AC too as the weather was extremely hot.",
          "A wonderful find in Granada! Small, intimate venue which allows you to see and experience every dance movement (feet and hands) and facial expression. Traditional flamenco music (guitarist and vocalists) complemented the dancing perfectly. In addition, the guitarist performed",
          "We were worried that this might be touristy, but it lived up to the good reviews. We enjoyed the performers, the venue was small and intimate. Great experience.",
          "A wonderful Flamenco performance, truly great and surprisingly entertaining. Lot's of variation within the show which keeps you intrigued from the first minute it starts! Go a little bit earlier to assure your seat!",
          "The very impressive authentic performance with music and excellent location. We recommend this venue.",
          "Definitely worth your money! Every single performer was talented. Loved the guitarist playing traditional Spanish music. The singer was amazing and ofcourse the two dancers were brilliant. So dramatic and emotional; they clearly love what they do. We read reviews and heard this",
          "While in Granada, we were keen on seeing some flamenco but wanted to avoid the dinner/show business. So while walking the old city streets, we stumbled by chance on the Casa del Arte Flamenco. It had a good feeling and we booked a show for the following day. We were not",
          "Lived in Spain when I was younger, and I went to mediocre flamenco performance then. I had low expectations for this show. However, the experience completely blew to bits my expectations. Every performer\u2014guitarist, singer, male & female dancer\u2014was so impressive. Went with my",
          "There are several flamenco venues in Granada and we were pretty confused after reading all the reviews and recommendations. We wanted a traditional show that wasn't too touristy. We ended up taking our hotel's recommendation and got exactly what we wanted. The performance was",
          "Case del Arte is an intimate venue dedicated to the art of Flamenco. It is not in a bar or restaurant - it's just highly skilled Flamenco musicianship and dance. We booked a day or two before and were astounded by the passionate singing and guitar. The dancing was wonderful",
          "This Flamenco show is not to be missed if you are in Granada You can feel the intensity of the passion from both male and female performers Amazing performance and true flamenco in an intimate theatre \ud83c\udfad Fantastic 10/10",
          "Our original flamenco booking let us down so we were directed here by the local tour office. The venue, the dancing the ambiance were all very intimate. The level of performance was unforgettable.",
          "Performance was great! location was very convenient, just off the Plaza Noeva. Seats are extremely uncomfortable that I end up standing up to keep watching. I am glad that I got seat in the last row.",
          "We chose to go to this more authentic performance of flamenco, rather than one at the more touristy restaurant venues. We were very glad we did. The performances radiated passion with a capital 'P!' From the incredible dexterity of the guitarist and the plaintive cries of the",
          "We were keen to see an authentic flamenco show while in Granada, and chose this theatre-style version instead of those offered in caves or bars. We think we made the right choice. The venue is quite intimate, with the audience sitting very close, which seems even more intimate",
          "Incredible performance, guitar, singing, dancing all captivating. Thoroughly enjoyed our 1st experience of Flamenco.",
          "I have been a guitar (mediocre) player since elementary school. Started playing flamenco about 10 years ago and appreciate anything to do with this form of art. I saw a show in Sevilla a few days ago that was good but these folks are clearly the best ever. Cantaor .... tocaor",
          "We've been to several places in Madrid, Granada, and Sevilla over the years. This was hands-down the best. Vibrant, fervent, passionate performances in an intimate space where everyone in the audience can see (an important point, and not one that obtains everywhere). The dancers",
          "Mostly a tourist audience, but excellent four person one hour shows. Strong performances, worth price. Definitely check this place out! Best in Grenada.",
          "It was so so good! I went with my family and peering over at them at various points throughout the show and all their faces were beaming. As a taste of the south of Spain I\u2019d really recommend this to anybody, especially if you\u2019ve never heard live flamenco. The music is",
          "Super! Super! Super! Havent seen other flamenco shows to compare with as it was my first experience but definately worth it and must see if visiting Spain",
          "This was a first class show. The singer, guitarist and dancers were all outstanding. These are professionals, not amateurs. If you want to see genuine flamenco dancing, this is the place to go. The theater is a small intimate setting. Surprisingly, is someone new to this art,",
          "This is a very small theater fitting about 60 people, so get there early to get a good seat. The guitarist was fabulous and the dancers (I especially liked the woman) were extremely energetic. The singing was not to my taste but it is a different culture so it is good to",
          "A very small teather, but very good musicians and dancers. Not as I expected from flamenco in Spain, but on the end - fair.",
          "Great performance, lasting one hour! Small room, small stage...and you are so close to the artists...you could almost hear them breathing. Impressive even if you are not passioned by dance. It is about Andalousian culture. Highly recomanded.",
          "A small venue which has top performers. This flamenco was much more passionate and intense than anything we have previously experienced. An unforgettable evening",
          "I Recommend this show, it is very nice. The dancers and the musician are the best. And it is easy to find this place for the tourists.",
          "This was a wonderful treat on a recent visit to Granada. Had never experienced flamenco 'live' so cannot claim to be a connoisseur but to my mind it was a spirited and impassioned performance by Juan Angel Tirado, Luis de Luis, Saray Fern\u00e1ndez and their guitarist whose name I",
          "The guitarist Ruben Campos was fantastic. And the singer had pasi\u00f3n. We found the dancers less to our taste than on our visit last November when we were blown away by the male and female dancers. But it\u2019s always worth a visit. ALWAYS. Everyone commits and they\u2019re all true",
          "We so enjoyed this show. The singing, guitar playing and dancing was mesmerising. The seating was tiered so every seat had a great view - especially of the dancers\u2019 feet. Loved that there was no photography allowed until the end so you really could get lost in the performance.",
          "My family (husband, daughter age 9, soon age 12) all enjoyed the performance. The dancers and musicians were excellent and seemed to be completely immersed in their performances, not just going through the motions. I found it completely engrossing for the hour. I also loved that",
          "Well, I loved it. All 4 performers were excellent. The lady singer with the perfect Flamenco voice, the guitarist, and the male and female dancers who threw everything into it. I cannot judge it with anything else, and am not an expert on Flamenco but the energy was high and",
          "Overall is very good because the male dancer saves the performance along with the guitar player. The other two are not bad, but average. The place was over-crowded to a dangerous point.",
          "Went to the show with a group of friends and was not disappointed! The small venue makes for an intimate performance. The dancers, singer and guitarist are all amazing and performed with extreme passion! Great show for great value!",
          "A very modest place but of a high standard. The dancers were mesmerizing and the musicians outstanding",
          "The guitarist was excellent, the singer fully put all into her singing. The female dancer & male the 2nd 1/2, used her/his body & skills to fully express emotion. Couldn't have asked for anything better!",
          "Went to a 5:30 Show with my wife and daughter. Seating is first come first serve so showing up early is recommended. Some of the last people to arrive sat on a stairway and some less then ideal seating locations. They definitely pack in as many people as they can in a very small",
          "This tiny place is easy to get to, right off the Plaza Nuevo. If you keep walking uphill, you'll get to the Alhambra and all its magic. For flamenco, it's inexpensive, too. Something like 15 euros, as opposed to the drinks and dinner places which can run twice as much.",
          "The show is great, singer, darcers, place is also nice! Buying tickets in advance by internet there was a discount! Is necessary to be there around 40 minutes before the show and expect that people there respect the line formed by themselves, but worked! So recommended place",
          "We loved it. Great music and dancing. A real treat. Only advice would be that theatre is very small so turn up early to ensure you get a good seat.",
          "This lived up to its reputation. Superb! Only four people performed (a guitarist, a singer and 2 dancers). A small place (only 50 seats), so book tickets early. And the lady at reception even allowed us the online discount!",
          "This flamenco show is for people who want to see the real thing, skilled flamenco rather than a commercial, touristy experience. The venue is modest; no refreshments are offered; the narrow chairs have wooden slatted seats (Sit on your coat) and closely packed. There were only 4",
          "We wanted to see a good show so did our research and this venue was highly rated. It did not disappoint....... fiery , passionate Flamenco with no one trying to sell you food and drink as a package. The show lasts an hour , the venue is intimate ( about 50 seats ) get there",
          "We arrived before 7pm & there were already people going, so get there early if you want the front row but the venue is very small. I've seen flamenco a few times and this was a bit different (in a good way) and they didn't dance as a couple, but the guy was the best flamenco",
          "We heard from a friend that this show was worth seeing and we weren\u2019t disappointed. We booked in advance and selected the later of the two shows at 9pm giving us time to eat dinner first. You can do the reverse with the 7.30pm show if you prefer. The venue is small and probably",
          "We wanted to go to a less tourist flamenco show, so opted for Thai rather than a dinner show. The space was small and intimate, no bad seats. All the performers were first rate; nuanced singing, excellent guitar, and the dancing! When the femal dancer came out, she wasn\u2019t young.",
          "Seen flamenco in large theatre's but this is close up intimate. Book in advance and get there early for the best seats. There are pillars to one side which restrict ones view and you can smell the toilet on that side too. Brilliant performance and friendly staff",
          "Sunday evening at 7:30 pm. We were seeing Flamenco for the first time. No prior experience. No expectations. Small theater seating approximately 50 people. No drinks sold. Simply a one hour performance. A guitarist who was quite impressive, a singer, a female dancer and a",
          "Great intro to flamenco with guitar, singer, male and female dancers. Each is the focus of a particular section, allowing wonderful demonstration of skills and intense performance. When we were there the room was fully packed and seating is not allocated but first come first",
          "This was value for money and gave you a look and traditional Flamenco. The dancing was amazingly intense. Small venue so best book tickets in advance from tourist centres.",
          "I went here under pressure from the better half, but it exceeded both out expectations. This isn't a tourist trap but a d\u00e9monstration of incredible talent and commitment. The performers seem to enjoy their work. For my part it was worth it just for the guitare solo let alone the",
          "First time at a Flamenco show. The performance was raw, emotional and intense. All very talented performers, artists included an fabulous guitarist, a very passionate singer and 2-impressive dancers. Dancers performed individually (I had expected they would dance as a couple).",
          "Visited last night. All of the performers were excellent. Venue is a little stark. Not much atmosphere but when the performance starts you become completely drawn in.",
          "We really enjoyed the show! Started on time and ended about one hour later. There were four performers. Each delivers an intense, quality performance. I especially liked the guitarist. He played for the entire show! For an evening out of something not ordinarily seen, I highly",
          "Small and intimate venue, the flamenco was passionate and authentic. It's such a must whilst you're in Granada please don't miss out! Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointment as there aren't many seats.",
          "First time on a flamenco show, simply amazing. A really small place, that gets packed with people. Tickets online are sold at a discount.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the Flamenco performance at Casa Del Arte Flamenco. It was nice to have only a performance (not the whole dinner experience). The studio space was small (60 people max) so the viewer is close to the performers. We were entranced. Reasonable price. Well",
          "We went there without really knowing what to expect but the dance and singing is really amazing !! The guitar, singer and dancers are making the show as they go with a lot of emotions. Those emotions are palpable into the whole room. It's a really beautiful show and has to been",
          "First time for flamenco and was blown away. Essential viewing. Can not recommend more highly. Right in the heart of town.",
          "I hesitated a lot before choosing this one but I finally passed a perfact moment. The two dancer were amazing. The female dancer is very professional while the male dancer was really full of passion. You got really long flamenco dancer while I saw 2 days later another flamenco",
          "Fantastic flamenco show and a truly wonderful experience-dancers, musician and singer very talented and don\u2019t know how they kept up - must have been exhausted at the end. A true delight to watch and not to be missed.",
          "We were a little wary of watching a Flamenco show for fear of falling into a tourist trap. This place is definitely NOT that. It is Flamenco served up authentically without elaborate drinks and tapas. It is a simple presentation of a superb guitarist, Luis Mariano, that",
          "An intense show in a small intimate venue. It is worth seeing if you have 1hr to spare in the evening. Although it may seem a bit pricey at just under 20 euros.",
          "This is a really intimate space with a small stage. We were really lucky to get the last two seats without a prior reservation. (Hint: RESERVE!) The flamenco is one of the most authentic I've seen. A fabulous guitarist, passionate singer and two amazing dancers who displayed a",
          "Small and intimate room with terraced seating so everyone gets a view. Guitar player was one of the best I\u2019ve seen and heard, together with the singer made a passionate and moving performance. The dancers were something else, I\u2019ve seen a few flamencos but I must say both the",
          "Best life performance I have ever seen in my life. The small room, maybe 50 seats max, pushes you almost on the floor with the fantastic performing artists. We have to go home tomorrow but I would come back only to see them again! A must for everybody who visits Granada.",
          "We were impressed by the atmosphere: intimate audience with a mix of mainly tourists and some locals. Arrive early to get a better seat, but you\u2019ll get a good view no matter where. Although we didn\u2019t have any flamenco experiences to compare it to, we found the dancing and music",
          "During our 10 day Spain trip, we watched 3 Flamenco shows,: 2 in Seville and 1 in Granada. All excellent! Casa del Arte Flamenco had wonderful female performer that delivered raw gipsy style flamenco trough brilliant dancing routine and amusing facial expressions. The show was",
          "Great dancers, wonderful intensity--Duende--And it's right next door to a wine tasting bar. A very worthwhile Flamenco show.",
          "We were completely mesmerized by the energy of this event, the skill and passion of the performers. Tremendous!",
          "This show is amazing!! It has been the second flamenco show we visited (the first one was in Barcelona, not a really good one), and you can see the difference when someone really loves what they are doing! Their motivation to perform well inspired us, the dancers gave",
          "This place is well located close to Plaza Nueva and it has an early show. The show was very good - there was a guitarist, a percussionist and two dancers. The energy that went into the performance was impressive. It is an intimate venue and a very nice place to watch Flamenco.",
          "Great show , virtuoso guitar player, great soul singer and two wonderful dancers make an hour that you will not forget.",
          "Small, intimate, atmospheric flamenco venue - yes, even on a cold November Monday night - and superb performers. Flamenco this good and up close is a thrilling experience and not to be missed in you're in Granada.",
          "Myself and two friends were lucky enough to secure tickets for the early evening performance and were blown away by the sheer talent of the performers. By far the best flamenco I have seen. The one hour show was seemingly over in a flash and we were once again back in the real",
          "The performance (admission \u20ac16 seniors, 18 regular) was top notch. Very enjoyable. There were a male and a female dancer, a guitarist and a male singer, all young. The male dancer was particularly energetic and so was sweat drenched by his finale. The two dancers only performed",
          "Although the venue is small with uncomfortable wooden seats, I can't think of anything else of a negative nature. I have seen flamenco on several occasions, but never have I felt so up close almost part of the show. The guitarist was extra special and set the mood of",
          "Not knowing what to expect we arrived to be seated in a small room which was packed by the time of the performance. The guitarist and the singer came on stage and you could feel the intensity. Whilst I have no knowledge of Flamenco (and a resume in English would have been",
          "Intensely meant. Professionals all. Guitarist, singer and both male and female dancers. One of the best evenings ever. We will be back and take every opportunity to bring friends along. Exceptional value. After one hour of passion and artistry we were emotionally drained. The",
          "Really enjoyed the performance. Our first Flamenco and we were not disappointed. Loved the intimacy of the venue. Only one very small criticism, is that we had to sit for an hour and a half on wooden chairs and at our age it can be a bit uncomfortable. A cushion would have been",
          "A highlight - among many - of a visit to Granada, in part because it was so different from \"touring.\" At first sight, the performance and seating areas seem small, but the effect is electric in bonding the performers and audience. The intensity of the performers is",
          "Two shows daily at 7.30 and 9.oo. Booked online for 15 euros. Intimate venue which was a perfect setting to experience the emotion of flamenco. Four performers - flamenco guitarist, singer and 2 dancers, one female, one male - all were excellent. Footwork by dancers was",
          "We decided to go to Flamenco as part of our visit to Granada and were recommended Cara del Arte Flamenco. They do two performances per evening at 7:30 and 9:00. We went to the later show. The hotel booked and we collected tickets at 8:30. The space is quite small, maybe 40",
          "We had limited time in Granada, and sought advice from our local pension host about best flamenco performance choices. Casa del Arte Flamenco was one of the two she suggested. We weren't disappointed. All four performers were simply amazing. Their artistry & skill over the one",
          "Our hotel recommended the Flamenco performances up in the Sacromonte region, but we opted to go here instead due to time. No regrets because this show was very energetic by a troupe that clearly enjoyed working together. At our show, a couple of alumni (possibly) came to watch",
          "We resisted the temptation to see our first flamenco show in the Sacramonte gypsy caves, having heard worrying reviews about scams there (we were told by locals that the caves are 'free to enter but a fortune to leave'), so we headed to this place just off Plaza Nueva instead.",
          "Booked tickets online - 3 euros cheaper - no problem. Small venue - get there early to get a good seat. Nearer the front gives best view of the rapid feet. Need to avoid the couple of pillars. Didnt understand a word of the songs or the story behind the songs but the flamenco",
          "We loved our visit. Absolutely a must see! As mentioned by others it's a small room with a small stage with fantastic performance by the dancers, the guitarist and the singer. Even our 10 year old son loved it. Make sure you come on time to have a good seat. (There are some",
          "Outstanding, on '' another (higher) level '' aka '' Fuera de este Mundo '' - ''Ole, Ole, Ole !!! Brilliant performance, at this 'boutique' theater venue, a perfect size that combines, good viewing and room to be comfortable, with an intimate, close to the artists action",
          "We walked past this place on our way back from Alhambra and bought tickets (18 euros). We've never see or heard flamenco before and we're so impressed! There was one guitarist, a singer and a female and a male dancers. Their rythm and skill was so amazing you wanted to get up",
          "The cozy atmosphere creates a lovely intimate setting. Yes, the stage is small (one of the complaints I\u2019d seen in prior reviews before deciding to go), but it did not diminish the experience or seem restrictive to the dancers. The artists were enraptured by the music, rhythm and",
          "What a show. Small venue so you need to book ahead. Guitarist superb. Singer not my cup of tea, but probably excellent if you like tortured. The female dancer was excellent, but the male dancer was outstanding. Just sat there amazed at his skill. He was also very easy on the eye.",
          "After reading several reviews we decided to give this tiny theater space a try, expected to be entertained, we were amazed. What a show! The small intimate seating added to the energy of the music and dance performance. Truly a fantastic experience",
          "We went for a 7:30 show, place is very clean and organized. It is small but this makes for a very intimate, easy to watch flamenco show. The guitar player, singer and the 2 dancers, men and woman, were very good. For 1 hour it was a very pleasing show. Would highly recommend it.",
          "This show was the highlight of our three days in Granada, The seating was terraced away from the stage so everyone could see clearly and we booked on line so the cost was a very reasonable 15 euros. The guitarist and the male singer who looked like a distant relation of Garfield",
          "The venue is very small and intimate. Possibly 60 or so seats. We had to sit up dome side stairs but the view was 95% fine and the shadows on the wall were brilliant if the dancer slipped behind a pillar for a few seconds. The guitarist singer and dancers were all",
          "Just a fantastic show, from start to finish. The venue is very small which means that every seat is good and it's a really intimate experience. Thankfully, no photos are allowed (until the very end when they tell you it's okay), so you just get to sit and enjoy instead of trying",
          "This is an authentic flamenco show with the beautiful, typical Arabic sound to the singing and the dancing - just wow! The guitarist was excellent too! I can highly recommend this show. It's set in a small room with a stage so you are quite close to the dancing. It had the",
          "Our initial reaction to the show was mixed - great guitarist (who we could have listened to for longer than the solo he played), mediocre singer and passionate dancers - one male, one female. The venue is small - an audience of 40-50 packed into a small room with some having to",
          "Flamenco lies at the heart of Spanish culture, and this Casa presents a supremely authentic introduction to this complex and enchanting musical tradition. The staff are supremely helpful, the tickets are very reasonably priced (16 Euros for senior citizens), the venue is",
          "Witnessing incredibly talented and professional performers was one of the main highlights of our visit to Granada! A small venue, without the distractions of food, drinks and cameras was a unique experience that allowed us to truly appreciate the masters of the art.",
          "Just witnessed art at its finest: guitar, singing and dancing , all passionate and emotional! Touristy flamenco places cannot be compared to this place. Not to be missed if you are in Granada!",
          "We went to this Venue last Thursday, 14th sept, and booked online, which made the tickets 15 euros each. Small intimate theatre type room, with tiered seating for around 40 people. Wasn't sure what to expect but boy, it was amazing !!! The live guitarist and vocalist start",
          "Read reviews on local Flamenco performances and opted for this venue as I was invited into the venue whilst doing a reccie of the local area. The venue looked OK, therefore we booked on- line for that evening performance. My wife loves a few types of dancing. The Quartet of",
          "Fantastic show, not to miss if u are visiting Granada. Get the tickets from tourist office, they are cheaper then the place itself.",
          "This is no tourist trap 'flamenco experience'. This was raw, emotional and immediate. Wonderful performances - dance, singing and guitar. For one hour you are taken on a 'performance experience'. Wonderful. Great value at 14-18\u20ac Must see!",
          "Casa del Arte Flamenco is in the perfect location, right in the centre of Granada with lots of nearby places to eat or drink before or after the show. The staff were very welcoming, spoke both Spanish and English. Venue is very cosy and intimate and was full. We went to watch",
          "So disappointed in this place and the performance. Guitar player seemed disinterested and lost rhythm. Other performers and staff seemed very disorganized. Dance floor was so small that it seemed dancers had to be inhibited in their motions and I was fearful that there",
          "Been traveling around the region and this was the fifth Flamenco performance we had attended. The guitarist was not on rhythm and except for one dancer it felt like all of the others wanted to not be there. If we could have, we would have left, it was that bad. Typically we are",
          "We attended the 10.30pm show, the room was small and full to capacity. The performers seemed to give it everything they had, it did not feel like a tourist only venue. There were a lot of Spanish flamenco fans in the audience who seemed to enjoy it as much as we did. The hour",
          "After having been to 2 amazing Flamencos in Madrid, i was a bit disappointed with this show. Although the performers individually were good, the overall performance wasn't enticing. The aucoustic of the place wasn't great - it was way too loud. Also we were hoping for more",
          "Although it was just another touristy attraction, the group performed very well. The room, a nice patio with a rooftop, was small but not crowded, it was very hot, and it felt very authentic. The final, which I like most of a show, was used as a \"photo oppportunity\" which I",
          "I attended the flamenco show on the 30th of August at Casa del Arte Flamenco. The venue is conveniently located just by the entrance to Alhambra, only minutes away from Plaza de Isabel La Cat\u00f3lica. Two shows a night are on offer - at 19:30 and at 21:30, opening doors 30 minutes",
          "Entertaining flemenco by very skilled dancers. Lasted about one hour. There is no bar. You can take drinks in. Its a stage and dancers and a guiatr player for our session. You can book online and its cheaper or phone to book. We were with our children aged 10 and 13 so it suited",
          "The reason we chose this place was its location right in the center and also its outstanding reviews. Tickets were reasonably priced and time of the show was perfect for us. The hall is quite small which works perfectly for creating an intense and personal ambience for the show.",
          "Visited last night for the 19.30 performance. Truly breathtaking. One hour of intense Flamenco performed with incredible passion. I have no idea how the artists can manage two performances a night given the effort they put in to the show we watched. Highly recommended.",
          "We saw the posters for this show in Granada centre and we bought our tickets in a local shop. We are really glad that we went - all of the performers were amazing and put on such a good show. I would definitely recommend anyone to watch the show. It lasts approximately 1 hour",
          "We weren't able to make it Seville on this trip, so this had to hold us over as a taste of Flamenco. It was wonderful. Very intimate venue. One signer, one guitar player (very talented), one male dance and one female. That's it. And a full hour long performance. They all put",
          "We really love this show. The energy and passion make the show. Place is very small, but this is the best thing in this show.",
          "I've seen a LOT of flamenco over the years, and this was truly one of the best that I've seen. The troupe was extremely talented, cohesive and passionate. Very highly recommended!",
          "Very happy to have happened upon this intimate dance space. We caught a great taste of flamenco. The performers were talented and passionate. The tickets were also affordable.",
          "Glad I picked this small place for taste of authentic flamenco show. Stage is small but audience seats so close to it that makes truly experience music and power of the dance. Loved dancers performing with such artistic expressions that almost felt like experiencing their joy",
          "We recently had a friend buy tickets for a large group to see a show at this location. We were delayed on a long drive from Seville and arrived a bit late. We hoped to be seated during a break in the action, as most shows, even Broadway shows allow. We found the lights off",
          "We bought tickets in tobacco shop the same day as show takes, in the morning. Coming at 19:00 you will have a chance to choose sit as you prefer. There were about 20 people during spectacle so it had very intimate atmosphere. In the beginning I was not sure if we done well",
          "I visited the Casa del Arte Flamenco while vacationing in Granada in June 2017, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I am not a flamenco aficionado but thought the performance was full of energy, intensity, and passion. As a member of the audience, you had the impression",
          "As this was our first flamenco show I wasn't really sure what to expect, but it was absolutely amazing! The dancers have so much passion, and the seats are so close to the stage you can really feel the emotion. (Seats aren't reserved, so make sure to come when doors open - or a",
          "I knew I wanted to see a flamenco but wasn't sure exactly the best place to go. We walked by this place and bought the tickets on a whim. It was totally worth it and we had a great experience! The room is small but you can see from anywhere. It was also nicely air conditioned",
          "I have been to Flamenco in Boston and Madrid. They were fantastic. But this show was by far the best of all. I have never seen anything so passionate. A real treat for all.",
          "My friends were visiting from the US and wanted to see true Flamenco, so of course we thought of Granada, and Casa del Arte Flamenco delivered an impressive experience for all of us. Thank you so much, and we loved the singing, dancing and guitar!",
          "An absolute MUST SEE in Granada - the hour long show felt like 10 minutes. These experts take you to another place entirely Son los reyes y reinas del flamenco!!!!!",
          "Excellent Flamenco show. Authentic, non touristic, no frills and FULL of passion. Small theatre that captures the ambience of a real Flamenco show. Extraordinary dancers, singer and guitar player. Well organised and professional. Please do yourself a favour and visit this place.",
          "We booked the 7:30 show in advance and it was wonderful. The cozy theater has great acoustics and lighting. The one hour performance was captivating -- 2 dancers, a singer and a guitar player. Very traditional and authentic performance. Well work the 15 Euros we paid! Strongly",
          "We bought tickets at the door and thoroughly enjoyed the performance. Guitarist, singer and dancers were all brilliant and emotional. Great little venue.",
          "Not at all what I expected but I'm glad we went. It's a very small theatre, with a very small stage and uncomfortable seats, some of which don't have the best view (tip: buy your (inexpensive) tickets in advance and get in the queue at least half an hour beforehand as seats are",
          "The highlight of our Granada trip. The performers ooze passion, performing this delicate art with great verve and energy. It shook me to the core. After the performance, the artists were kind enough to meet us for a picture, on request. Don't miss it!",
          "This month we went my girlfriend and I with a couple of friends to Andalusia and we really wanted to see the real flamenco, but unfortunately the place did not meet our expectations. We chose it because in the gift shop next to the cathedral they recomended us the place. Before",
          "This is real Flamenco, in a small intimate venue. Admittedly, the fold up seats aren't great BUT the hour flies by on a flurry of song, dance and passion. Real art, really close-up. A fantastic show.",
          "The show is done with love, passion and skill. Beautiful combination of guitar, song and firy flamenco dance. Highly recommended! Thanks for the great show!",
          "This is a small venue, which means you're really up close with the performers. We've seen a number of flamenco shows before, but this must go down as by far the best. There's no distraction with food. Just pure flamenco. There are just four performers - guitarist, vocalist,",
          "We went to the 7h30 presentation . My wife and I had a very good time in this place. Guitarist, singer and dancers were perfect. Sound was very good in this tiny place and everyone is closed to the show.",
          "A solid hour of flamenco music, song and dancing.....and when I say dancing, well...you've never seen dancing like this before....the speed, the rhythm, the amazing footwork, the sweat and the applause....not to be missed...it will get your pulse racing and you will want to",
          "The flamenco was authentic. However, i booked tickets in advance online.i was expecting to have a reserved seat. However, my seat was not a good one and I could not see well the performance.",
          "We visited Casa del Arte Flamenco last evening. We arrived just after 7pm and the place was already full but we were given two side seats with a good view of the performers. They were excellent without exception. The guitarist was superb, the singer knew his art and the two",
          "This is a show with incredibly talented dancers, singer, and guitarist! While I had planned on being disappointed as it was not a live bar type of nightly flamenco by locals, we were SO impressed by the talent of these 4! Left smiling with the music in my head. It's the",
          "We saw this tonight and really enjoyed it. It was our first flamenco show, so we don't have anything to compare it to, but it was definitely entertaining.",
          "A small and modern place in the centre of Granada. The show was excellent, we loved every moment of it. The artists played guitar, sang and danced with passion.",
          "The stage and the room are rather small, but don't let that throw you. The quality of the performers and the spontaneity and excitement of the performance were exceptional. I have a much higher affinity for this art now.",
          "The show is very impressive and worth seeing for those who has never seen flamenco alive. Stage full of emotions, passion and very energetic professional, both female and male dancers. There is also a great singer on very large high heels but fortunately she didn't dance :-) and",
          "We have been to many Flamenco Shows, but this one was the MOST passionate, entertaining we have ever seen! Anyone in the area MUST see this show, there are others, but this one is the best!",
          "Very different to run-of-the-mill flamenco shows for tourists. Wonderful dancing , guitar playing and singing which actually told a story which could be followed by a non-Spanish speaker. Exciting, emotional, stirring. Excellent value.",
          "After some research into flamenco shows in Granada, we selected Casa Del Arte Flamenco. We were not disappointed and loved the show... singing, excellent guitar and of course, the dance. The venue is small and many people get squeezed into the facility. Arrive early to wait",
          "An absolutely fantastic and unmissable spectacle. Sound and movement absorb us deeply. Art in all its fullness. Many thanks to the artists for this unforgettable moment.",
          "We loved the show and the hostess was very accommodating. We accidentally bought tickets for the wrong date and realized it as we were walking into the show but they let us stay for the show and switched our ticket dates.",
          "Best out of a few we saw by far. Very intimate, great performers small stage and room. Please leave your kids at home, don't talk and enjoy an amazing performance!",
          "Wow! This was the most powerful performance I've ever seen. It's very intimate, with a tiny stage, yet all 4 performers projected so much passion and emotion into the room. I will definitely go back. I've never seen another Flamenco show to compare it to but if the standard is",
          "Small theater located in the center, it's convenient especially after a day of sightseeing when you are too tired to head to Sacromonte for a flamenco show in the evening. I enjoyed the show very much, the performers were all very professional. Small place meaning even if you",
          "We had time to compare several flamenco shows during our trip and this one was certainly the best, most classy and beautiful professional show. I highly recommend it!",
          "An hour of variety and pleasure. The performers really did seem to be committed to their art - on a Tuesday evening in April without a full house. This is a good introduction to flamenco for those who wish to experience it in pleasant surroundings close to the Plaza Nueva",
          "Having never seen Flamencos before perhaps I'm an easy target to appreciate it but it was outstanding! The venue is very intimate and the dancers, singer and Spanish guitarist are out of this world. Superbly talented, entrancing and the interplay between them is mesmerising.",
          "This is a small theatre which was directly opposite our hotel. We didn't really know what to expect but found the experience to be wonderful. The female dancer was amazing, such emotion and the male dancer's footwork was terrific. We went to the early show which was packed, i",
          "I was genuinely surprised by the authenticity of the show. The emotions of the artist were absolutely real and marvelously connected with high artistic level of their performance. The place is small and concentrates on the flamenco itself (no drinks of meals) which is perfect.",
          "We have never been to a Flamenco show before. This was excellent. In a small theatre style. Very absorbing and enjoying. The way the dancers moved was incredible. The emotion and intensity of the performances was enthralling.",
          "The location is a small theatre. They don't sell food or drink. The female dancer may be a little older than you might expect, but don't be fooled - she's fiery. Excellent guitar playing, male dancer's footwork is amazing. The place was quite full, so it might be better to get",
          "We really enjoyed this flamenco show. We liked that they took the art form very seriously. Show started on time, the ambiance was good, and was nice that there was no food or drink involved, allowing full focus on the show. We liked that the hall was small allowing more focus.",
          "This show sells no drink or food. The performance venue is small and was an old enclosed courtyard. This is simply dance and costumes are simple and basic. The location is in a very safe, walkable area. Also the 60 minute show is very ok for children. The theatre seats maybe 50+",
          "We wanted to watch an authentic flamenco show that didn't include a meal or a drink. This was it, professional, intimate and exhilarating. The lady at the front, communicated well in English and agreed to show us the theatre before we purchased tickets. The show started on time",
          "a tiny 'theatre', that shows smth very far from flamenco... the show doesn't worth a penny :((( even costumes are not appropriate for a dance. nether will recommend to anyone. After the show we met a guy on the street, whose dance was much more impressive. totally disappointing.",
          "Excellent. Intimate setting. Dancers are very confident and strong. The artists pour their heart and soul into it. Definitely one of the highlights of visiting Granada.",
          "This tiny space is ideal for enjoying the formidable ability of the dancers. Price is reasonable, ticketing process easy. I really enjoyed the fact that it is a flamenco performance - guitar, singing and dance - there are no attmpts to sell you drinks, dinner or whatever.",
          "I asked our friends, who grew up in the area and have listened to flamenco all their lives, to find us good flamenco music in an intimate setting. I've had my fill of big extravaganzas in big halls and really just wanted to hear good music played by local musicians; I wanted to",
          "We have seen several flamenco shows, and we liked this one in particular, although it is aimed at foreign tourists it is good in general terms. The biggest advantage is that there are located in the heart of the city, and even if doesn\u2019t have the charm of the of the Tablaos of",
          "The flamenco show at the Casa del Arte Flamenco is excellent, the seating is not. We bought our tickets in advance and thought we were getting there early enough, but found ourselves seated separately from each other, way in the back with a post in front of two of us...very",
          "This small theatre is a much better Flamenco experience than we thought. We imagined a smoky bar people by gypsy dancers but, when you emerge, you may not make it home!! This Flamenco experience is just off Plaza Nuevo and is safe and on the main streets. The four",
          "Highly recommend this show. All the performers were very professional and took their art very seriously. Intimate theatre and the show was quite exhausting to watch as it was so energetic!",
          "The Casa del Arte Flamenco lives up to its name. The performers are engrossing and take their art seriously. This shows in the performance where their focus is on display. They appear to be living the performance as if their lives depend on it. It's a first rate show by any",
          "A fine guitar player and dramatic show was enjoyed by all. There are different performers each week. Easy to locate as well. No frills, drinks or gimmicks - just a top show. If you need a bit more leg room get there a bit early.",
          "Check all flamenco show reviews in Granada and the Casa del Arte comes way out on top for all the right reasons. We loved the classical talent performing to a small, well sighted auditorium. There is no distraction of being encouraged to buy trinkets or drinks.... embrace an",
          "Such a group of talented performers! We had a delightful evening and felt privileged to witness these wonderful performers work together.",
          "This is indeed a great performance! Do not expect to attend a casual, easy atmosphere show. The deep feeling, great energy and expression, the genuine spirit of flamingo, are expressed well in the performance. One can hardly been touched and deeply exposed to the great",
          "exceptional performance by a young couple of fantastic dancers , skilled talented and full of energy and passion, acompanied by alady singer and a good guitarist. the intimate and pleasent hall are another bonus. a wonderful experience. highly recomended !",
          "While I am sure that this is primarily a place for tourists, we really enjoyed the concert. All the players, guitarist and singer along with the two dancers, were very skilled and very engaged in the music. We both enjoyed ourselves tremendously and got at least a glimpse of",
          "we went to three venues for flamenco. The dancing, the singing and the guitar playing was absolutely brilliant and felt very authentic. It was much less touristy than the other places so a mix between a private flamenco club and places that are accessible to tourists. It",
          "You won't spend much time here (maybe 1-2 hours) but it's definitely something to do on a rainy day, or when you just want to visit something cultural. Flamenco is a huge part of Spain, and this museum does it justice. You'll learn a lot and its a really cool inside scoop.",
          "One hour performance, we were lucky to get tickets on the door, they are slightly cheaper online. Dancers and singer and guitarist were all great. The only thing we missed is the audience participation as it was mainly tourists, still I would recommend it.",
          "The performance was OK, but not outstanding. Overall, 1 hour program consisted of several guitar solos, singer solo and 2 dance solos. Although the dancers (2 ladies) did their best, the overall show didn't took away my breath. First of all - only female dancing, secondly only 2",
          "it was a very nice show, good dancers. it was our first time to watch flamenco show and we enjoyed it :) recommended",
          "Authentic Flamenco guitar, singing and dance. I would have opted for the more expensive, longer 2-3 hour show including drinks and/or dinner at a different venue, but hubby is not a great fan of performing arts and a running time of an hour seemed the better choice. We were",
          "I booked our tickets after reading the review in Lonely Planet and we were NOT disappointed! I was mesmerized from moment one...an intimate venue with pretty comfortable seating and awesome, skillful flamenco. The singing, guitar and dancing was incredible. The hour-long",
          "The room size was small, so you could see the expressions very clearly. There was an amazing amount of energy charging about the room. The singer was very good, you felt the emotion.",
          "Amazing performance by dancers who really left everything on stage. Tips for booking tickets- I emailed the place 3 days before my trip to reserve seats for my group. Then on the day of the performance, just had to pay for and collect my tickets. Be at the venue 40 minutes",
          "The dancers are the best i have seen, the main dancer danes with a deep attention and sensitivity to music and she, Sara, is a vulcano. The guitarist too is very skilled. The place is not fantastic, like in Sevilla, is a small hall in a house but the artistic show of the dancers",
          "Just finished watching an absolutely breathtaking 100% authentic show. Don't miss it egen in Granada!",
          "Small venue which makes it a really intimate experience. Singers, guitarist and dancers all performed individually and together, all extremely well. A very nice show.",
          "Highly expressive and mesmerizing performance. Loved every second of it. Even my 7 yr old enjoyed it. The venue is conveniently located. Tickets are available everywhere but we bought the tickets at the venue itself. Only \u20ac18.00 @ adult. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

          "I have been here several times now and always found the show delightful. The performers are very professional and the guitarist is out of this world. The venue is small and I suppose this is what led to a slight problem this time - the company obviously sells tickets also",
          "We visited the 7.30 pm show by really knowing what to expect. After waiting for some minutes till the starting time it started, right on time. And what an experience it was!! Simply spellbinding! The show was for an hour and there wasn't a minute where we got bored. The singer,",

          "Enjoyed this much more than I was expecting. It is demonstration of the dance and music of the area. It is a no 'frills' performance but all the better for it. It is packed and the chairs are hard but you are only there for an hour and will be captivated.",
          "This place was my fourth place in four nights to see Flamenco. I loved Flamenco that much and this spot in particular was great. Music, dancing, singing ... all marvelous. Of course, it depends on who is performing that night, but something tells me even mediocre flamenco is",

          "The performers I saw here were fantastic. A tremendous energy from all of them. The dancers had an improvisational and artistic flair unlike any I've seen in Andalusia. Terrific soulful singer and guitarist as well. It's a small venue, and for the price it's well worth attending!",
          "This was the first time I have been to a Flamenco show and I thought it was great fun. The show lasts an hour which felt like the right length of time and featured four performers, a male and female dancer, a guitarist and singer. I thought the guitarist was excellent and the",
          "This venue was recommended to us by someone much more knowledgeable about the art of flamenco than we are. You just watch the performers: no drinks or food. We saw a guitarist, singer, and two dancers, and they were all wonderful. They managed to give a sense of drama, passion",
          "I had absolutely no idea what to expect. Had just a day in Granada & Flamenco was a must to-do on my list. We took an evening show and were absolutely enthralled! Its a marvellous art form and I am glad I got introduced to it through Casa del arte Flamenco.",
          "Absolutely loved this show! We'd never been to a flamenco show before and there are many to choose from but we liked the idea of the raw, intimate setting. We were blown away by the show the first time and decided to go back a couple of evenings later. There were different",

          "For us who have a number of flamenco performance comparisons we can draw on, we felt this was a mixed performance. The guitarist was technically good but without passion or real sensitivity. The female dancer was good but her moves seemed limited. There was also a male singer.",
          "This was a wonderful experience with my family. I loved that we sat on the front row and were able to be so close to the dancers and musicians. It is a brilliant and wonderful experience, my children are teenagers and I wanted to share this experience with them following a day",
          "I fell in love with the art of flamenco several years ago and my experience here just cemented that love. It is a tiny, intimate venue with a tiny stage, but it is perfect for the artists. The guitarist was one of the best I'd ever heard and both the male and female dancers",

          "The show was very outstanding! The performing room was actually quite small, with roughly 40 people in maximum. As a result, you can get very close to the artists and observe their facial expression as well as the whole stage clearly. The facility was fine and there was no",

          "We asked our guide who showed us around the Alhambra where to go for the best flamenco and this was where he recommended. This is real flamenco, it isn't part of a meal package, it is an hour of pure flamenco. Fabulous guitar, singing flamenco style (which I still struggle a",
          "There are many flamenco shows in Granada with people approaching you in the street looking to sell you tickets. We attended Casa Del Arte Flamenco which was just over the road from our hotel. We were not disappointed. The venue is quite small with the stage likewise. This means",
          "On our recent trip to Spain, we have been to flamenco caves, attended flamenco performances in theaters and seen flamenco dinner shows. But Casa del Arte is a real deal. A small stage in a cozy, tiny theater in front of an audience of about 50 is what it takes to experience true",
          "Great dancers and great musicians in a show that lasts for about an hour; overall, a very enjoyable experience!",
          "Our host suggested this venue as being the best in Granada, when we said that we would like to go to a flamenco show. Don't get sucked into one of these Flamenco and Dinner arrangements as the food is pretty average as is the flamenco and you pay way over the odds for what you",

          "Decided against the tablao or caves as did not think our 10 and 9 year old children would last the whole evening. Their initial restlessness soon disappeared and the show was about 1 hour, just right for them. The performance was full of passion, with some captivating guitar",
          "This flamenco show was not pretty and small but strong and intensive drama that took people with it. The dancers, the singer and the guitar player all gave their best into the whole. Really splendid small place.",
          "We went here because of the rave reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed. I accidentally booked our tickets for the following night but the girl at the front desk kindly let us swap. The show started promptly at 2100. The best way I can describe it is a passionate",
          "We came upon this little intimate theater as we were walking down from the Alahambra. By intimate it is a small stage with seating for approximately 40 people. It does have a/c and you can bring drinks with you if you wish. This is an introduction to the art of Flamenco which",
          "Although the show is only an hour it is an intense experience, full of drama and brilliantly executed dance, singing and guitar playing. Authentic feel about the whole performance and I couldn't single out any one performer as they all did an amazing job. Whether you are an",
          "There are lots of flamenco spots in Granada that it's hard to tell which is a tourist gimmic and which is real. This one definitely is! Every night they do 2 shows with a different set of dancers, singer, and guitarist. These are true dancers who take their art seriously. You",
          "This was a little gem tucked away on Cuesta de gomerez just below the Alhambra. The show starts with a guitarist and a singer and they perform admirably. The female dancer gives her all and in the very intimate setting you really get a feel for the story unfolding. The male",

          "I had to accept the fact that there are no good flamenco shows in Granada, until I came across Casa Del Arte Flamenco. This show has managed to leave me speechless every time (yes, I came back. A lot!). Let me start with appreciating the venue itself. It's a small place that",
          "By accepting a flyer from a young lady on the street, we discovered a wonderful, authentic flamenco show in Granada. The venue was small, so the audience is very close to the performers, and all the seats have a good view. The dancers, guitar player, and singer were all",
          "This is an small flamenco-joint with seats for about 30-40 people. The show lasted one hour. The two dancers, a man and a woman, were very good! The singer I felt sang a little bit low, sometimes it was hard to hear him along with the guitar. But the most impressing was the man",
          "The performance was fantastic. All the artists (singer, two dancers, quitarist) were excellent. We spent one hour in magnificent place. Even my seven years old daughter was silently for one hour. Go see this! Fantastic!",
          "A splendid hour in a small, cosy, bijou theatre in the centre of town.The dancing is so energetic it leaves the audience exhausted!",
          "It's small production but what a treat to eyes and ears!! So emotional, so passionate, music is speaking to you and dancers are expressing the story. I've seen couple of flamenco shows before but this has been the best one for sure. Don't think twice, book it!",
          "Really worth it! The musicians and the dancers were incredible. You get a small (1 hour show) but real taste of flamenco leaving you wanting more! Absolutely recommend it!",
          "This was an incredible experience. The smaller venue made the show more intimate and I appreciated the no-frills entertainment. The guitarist, singer, and dancers were all amazing and I felt captivated during the entire performance. So much talent! My entire family agreed that",
          "This is not like seeing Flamenco in one of the gypsy caves but the Flamenco is of higher quality we are told. The night we went we ended up seeing on the most noted guitarists ever from Granada. The space is intimate, spare, and it only highlights the emotion of the art on",
          "We had a very enjoyable time here on 1st or 2nd June. Casa del arte was suggested in our guidebook and by the hotel owner. Powerful and passionate performance and all four performers were excellent. It's a small venue but comfortable and works well acoustically. Thoroughly",
          "Caught a second night. Guitarist again amazing. Female singer from the night before was dancing this time. Male singer and male dancer both outstanding. My 10 year old is just captivated by the virtuosic guitar.",
          "We came with our boys. We were all very impressed by the virtuoso performance of the guitarist and the singer. The passion of all was quite evident, even without understanding what they were singing about. The kids want to go again. The performers vary by night so we may be",
          "This show just blew my mind. It is the most intense live performance I have ever seen, and it was easily the highlight of my trip to Spain. It was absolutely beautiful. I bet many men have fallen in love with the woman dancer!",
          "This is a performance only, drinks & food are not available, so you are surrounded by people who are only interested in the Flamenco. It is only and hour long which is a perfect length of time .",
          "A small and basic theatre but a fabulous show - professional and passionate - a wonderful introduction to flamenco. Didn't have a chance to visit the caves, so can't compare but for 18 euros it was much cheaper (no meal or bar but OK to take BYO). Also enjoyed a very good show",
          "I was regretting having missed seeing a flamenco show in Seville but I came across Casa del Arte and was very happy I found them! Their performers are all very talented and full of passion and it resonates. The place is very small and adds a very romantic and authentic feeling.",
          "We went here on advice from a waiter. It is a show only ie not a bar or restaurant. The performers were excellent. We were very close to the stage so could see and here everything very well. The show started on time and concluded the same. Overall a very good experience and",
          "I don't know whether this is the best show in Granada as I have not seen any others there but it is by far the best show I have seen in Spain. The venue is good and welcoming. Music excellent as was the singing. The dancers just left us feeling shattered simply by watching them",
          "It was really energetic, fun and raw. I loved it so much but this is my first time watching real flamenco show (Street show doesn't count). If you are like me who loves performing arts and new to this type of show you must check it out. I was recommended of this show by a",
          "This performance was just as most say it is: intimate, intense, authentic. My wife and I were there in mid-April, and the performers sang and danced with passion and real conviction. No problem bringing your own drink, since they don\u2019t sell anything at the venue. (We brought a",
          "An intimate space where the performers bring out to the audience the true art of Flamenco dancing. A one hour performance which keeps your eyes wide open with the passion of every dance step and note played on the guitar.",
          "A fantastic one-hour performance by guitarist, singer and two dancers. A great performance in a small and beautifully set venue. Go see this! Fantastic value.",
          "All the artists were excellent: the guitarist, singer and the two dancers. They were very professional and gave a brilliant performance. It was the best flamenco I have seen. The choreography was very well done. Bonus- they were all very attractive too. Go! You are in",
          "A very small, sparse room, but don't let that dissuade you. The performers are first-rate, and the performances jaw-dropping.",
          "Didn't know what to expect. But it was unbelievably brilliant. DO NOT MISS IT. The venue was small but acoustics were great.",
          "In the beginning, we sat on the room for 15 minutes waiting for show to begin. It was a bit odd. They should have sold beverages during that time. Show consisted of multiple parts, first singing and playing guitar followed by singing, playing and woman dancing. Then there was a",
          "Intimate setting and very good value. You can't help by being carried away by the performance. We were fortunate to have visited the excellent Flamenco museum in Cordoba. This performance brought all the history, passion, pain and emotion to the stage. Not at all touristy. It's",
          "We tried four different Flamenco shows in Granada and this was the best. Very high quality musicians and dancers and beautifully executed. While some of the shows have resident artists, in general the artists tend to move from show to show. Therefore if you pick a night with",
          "I am a big fan of Flamenco and very aware that \"authentic\", Flamenco is spontaneous and cannot be seen in an organised paid for performance. Having said this Casa del Arte Flamenco, is an intimate show by accomplished performers, presented in a way which honours tradition. The",
          "I loved this show. The performers (guitarist, singer, male and female dancers) were all top notch, not only highly skilled but also full of extraordinary passion. The venue is small, with no bad seats, and fairly plain, but it doesn't really matter. The show is oriented to",
          "Excellent dancers Carlos Carbonel and Lucia Guarnido their movements weren't flailing arms whole bunch stomping but well coordinated dancing best so far in Granada. They have different dancers all the time. Get there early so the columns won't be part of the view.",
          "Only one hour show, but well worth the experience to watch and listen to some authentic Flamenco expression. The artists are truely passionate and genuine to their craft. The room is small and intimate with about 50 wooden chairs facing the stage. No food or drinks available,",
          "Great Flamenco show! Loved that the focus of this particular show was the dancing as that's the heart and soul of flamenco to me. Price to quality ratio is unbeatable and they let us bring drinks in as they did not have a bar. Highly recommended!",
          "I like the moment spent in la casa del Arte. Really good dancers nice moment..I recomend this place to everyone who like Flamenco",
          "An hour of classic and ad hoc dancing, fantastic guitarist, singer and dancers. Went too quickly - we were totally absorbed in the experience - not the crass touristy stuff but a gutsy performance with soul and emotion. Worth every Euro!",
          "We were staying in the ACSI Camping park at Beas de Grenada @ 20th March 2015 Saw the advert for Casa del Arte Flamenco on the Web site and as we were going into Granada the following day went to the ticket office which is so convenient just off Plaza Nuevo . The lady at the",
          "The performance at Casa del Arte Flamenco was really exciting, the actors; flamenco guitarist and dancers were true professionals. It was held in a small club for about 30-40 people and you were sitting just a meter away from the stage, so you were totally embraced by their",
          "The staff at the entrance was very friendly when we arrived with our 2 year old daughter and allowed us to buy tickets for the show. In itself it already was a great thing since in Sevilla, the tablaos don't want to take the risk to have such a young child in the audience even",
          "Authentic Flamenco in a nice small theatre. Fantastic performers!! I went to the Flamenco at Cardamomo in Madrid before. This was even better!!",
          "I've managed to stumble across this place rather than look it up, and I had no expectations coming in. The performance blew me away, it was vibrant and original, I thought all flamenco performances were like this but everything I saw afterwards paled in comparison. If you're",
          "Last night my husband and I had the pleasure of seeing 4 true artists perform their craft. We were treated to an amazing show that had the audience on its feet for a standing ovation at the end. Each artist, from the guitar player, to the singer, to the dancers were at the top",
          "I've seen many flamenco shows and this is among the best. What you get are four artists who express and convey their passion for this unique art form. No fancy or artificial atmosphere, just you and them in a shared emotional environment.",
          "My wife and I experienced very nice flamenco in Sevilla last year, this time, we tried Casa del Arte Flamenco in Granada. I found in website, booked online, paid 15 euros/per person through PayPal. According to their schedule, 1-guitarist, 1-singer, 1-female dancer, 1-male",
          "This was my very first visit to see a flamenco show and I have to say I was very impressed. Some of the shows in Granada give you drinks and a meal but this is literally just the bare bones of pure flamenco. There isn't even a bar here but you can take your own drinks. The",
          "A brilliant show, all the passion and brilliance of Flamenco Dance, Song and Guitar in the one hour show. The Casa del Arte is a small intimate theatre which has two performances a day...the earliest at 19.30 with doors opening at 19.00 and the second at 20.30, doors open at",
          "We are very keen on real Flamenco without all the tourist trappings, food etc and this was excellent. The one hour show held us mesmerised and the standard of the dancing, singing and guitar playing was top notch. Thank you all. Highly recommended.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Casa del Arte Flamenco. The performers were absolutely outstanding, and very passionate about their work. The theater doesn't serve drinks, but you are welcome to bring your own.",
          "We were afforded a private performance for our two groups on arrival in Grenada. Having heard that many of the performances have become Disney-ish - all glitter and no heart - we were pleased from the very beginning. The performance began with a guitar solo, played by a man with",
          "This was the first time I've seen flamenco, and was thoroughly impressed with the skill of all the performers. The venue is small and intimate, which I preferred over the tablao we visited later on our trip.",
          "I really liked the flamenco, but it was very very warm and stuffy and it was a rather small room. I would of preferred a larger room though due to the small setting it was more personal and compelling.",
          "I'm no expert on flamenco, and this is only my second show (first in Barcelona back in 2011), but I felt that it was authentic and intimate. Unlike other companies that offer food and drinks with the show, Casa del Arte Flamenco is a show only, and it doesn't even have a bar!",
          "We were tired after walking around the Alhambra, but responded to a leaflet handed to us in the street. Our tiredness melted as the show began. We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the performance and enjoyed the intimate atmosphere of the venue. I have seen a",
          "If you are no expert you will enjoy it very much. The guitarist was amazing and the rest of the crew were quite decent. I don't think this is the place to go for an expert, but I am not, so it was good. I missed the possibility of having a drink while seeing the show.",
          "One of the most memorable time in our Granada visit, one of the best Flamenco show for all Andalusia, it is a must when you visit.",
          "It has been a lifetime ambition to see a live flamenco show in Granada and this did not disappoint. The show involves a guitarist, singer, female dancer and male dancer. We are flamenco fans but not experts so obviously the following is just our opinions:- - the singer is very",
          "This was our very first Flamenco experience and a highlight of out time in Granada. Artistry of the singers, guitarist and dancer was beautiful and passionate as many others have said here...really almost brought tears. You just need to go and experience it. No food, drink or"

        "wiki": "Marbella (UK:  mar-BAY-y\u0259, US:  mar-BEL-\u0259, Spanish: [ma\u027e\u02c8\u03b2e\u028ea]) is a city and municipality in southern Spain, belonging to the province of M\u00e1laga in the autonomous community of Andalusia. It is part of the Costa del Sol and is the headquarters of the Association of Municipalities of the region; it is also the head of the judicial district that bears its name.\nMarbella is situated on the Mediterranean Sea, between M\u00e1laga and the Strait of Gibraltar, in the foothills of the Sierra Blanca. The municipality covers an area of 117 square kilometres (45 sq mi) crossed by highways on the coast, which are its main entrances.\nIn 2018 the population of the city was 141,463 inhabitants, making it the second most populous municipality in the province of M\u00e1laga and the eighth in Andalusia. It is one of the most important tourist cities of the Costa del Sol and throughout most of the year is an international tourist attraction, due mainly to its climate and tourist infrastructure.\nThe city also has a significant archaeological heritage, several museums and performance spaces,  and a cultural calendar  with events ranging from reggae concerts  to opera performances.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Marbella municipality occupies a strip of land that extends along forty-four kilometres (27 miles) of coastline of the Penib\u00e9tico region, sheltered by the slopes of the coastal mountain range, which includes  the Bermeja, Palmitera, Royal, White and Alpujata sub-ranges. Due to the proximity of the mountains to the coast, the city has a large gap between its north and south sides, thus providing views of the sea and mountain vistas from almost every part of the city. The coastline is heavily urbanised; most of the land not built up with golf courses has been developed with small residential areas. Marbella is bordered on the north by the municipalities of Ist\u00e1n and Oj\u00e9n, on the northwest by Benahav\u00eds, on the west by Estepona and on the northeast by Mijas. The Mediterranean Sea lies to the south.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nThere are five geomorphological units: the Sierra Blanca, the Sierra Blanca piedmont (foothills), the lower hill country, the plains and the coastal dunes. The Sierra Blanca is most centrally located in the province, looming over the old village. This mountain range has three peaks: La Concha, located further west at 1,215 m above sea level, Juanar Cross, located eastward (within the municipality of Ojen) at 1,178 m above sea level, and the highest, Mount Lastonar, located between the two at 1,270 metres. Marbella's topography is characterised by extensive coastal plains formed from eroded mountains. After the plain lies an area of higher elevations of between 100 and 400 m, occupied by low hills, behind which rise the foothills and steeper slopes of the mountains. The coast is generally low and has sandy beaches that are more extensive further east, between the fishing port and the Cabopino. Despite the intense urbanisation of the coast, it still retains a natural area of dunes, the Artola Dunes (Dunas de Artola), at the eastern end of town.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n\nThe entire region lies within the Andalusian Mediterranean Basin. The rivers are short and have very steep banks, so that flash floods are common. These include the Guadalmina, the Guadaiza, the Verde and the Rio Real, which provide most of the water supply. The irregularity of rainfall has resulted in intermittent rivers that often run dry in summer; most of the many streams that cross the city have been bridged. The La Concepci\u00f3n reservoir supplies the population with drinking water; apart from this there are other reservoirs like El Viejo and El Nuevo (the Old and the New) that irrigated the old agricultural colony of El \u00c1ngel, and  Las Medranas and Llano de la Leche that watered the plantations of the colony of San Pedro de Alc\u00e1ntara.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMarbella is protected on its northern side by the coastal mountains of the Cordillera Penib\u00e9tica and so enjoys a climate with an average annual temperature above 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F). The highest peaks of the mountains are occasionally covered with snow, which usually melts in a day or two. Average rainfall is 628 l/m\u00b2, while hours of sunshine average 2,900 annually.\n\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\n\nBecause most of the mountain areas around Marbella cannot be managed by the City Council and they are under the management of the central government, remnants of the land in its natural state are still preserved in the mountains, where there are chestnut and cherry trees, reforested firs, Aleppo, Monterrey and maritime pines; pinyons, and ferns. The fauna is represented by golden eagles, Bonelli's eagles, short-toed eagles, hawks, falcons, vultures, genets or musk cats, badgers, wild goats, deer, martens, foxes and rabbits.The coast has the Natural Monument site of the Dunas de Artola, one of the few protected natural beaches of the Costa del Sol, which contains marram grass, sea holly, sea daffodils and shrubs such as large-fruited juniper. The Posidonia oceanica, endemic to the Mediterranean, is found in the Cabopino area; it is an important part of the ecosystem in the sea around Marbella.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the census of the INE for 2018, Marbella had a population of 141,463 inhabitants, which ranked it as the second most populous city in the province of M\u00e1laga and eighth in Andalusia after surpassing C\u00e1diz in 2008. Unlike other towns in the Costa del Sol, Marbella had a significant population before the population explosion caused by the tourist boom of the 1960s. The census counted about 10,000 people in 1950; population growth since has been as significant as that of neighboring towns. Between 1950 and 2001 the population grew by 897%, with the decade of the 1960s having the highest relative increase, at 141%. In 2001, only 26.2% of Marbella's population had been born there, 15.9% were foreign-born, and those born in other towns in Spain made up the difference. During the summer months the population of Marbella  increases by 30% with the arrival of tourists and foreigners who have their second homes in the area.The population is concentrated in two main centres: Marbella and San Pedro Alc\u00e1ntara; the rest is scattered in many developments in the districts of Nueva Andalucia and Las Chapas, located along the coast and on the mountain slopes. According to a study by the Association of Municipalities of the Costa del Sol, based on the production of solid waste in 2003, Marbella had a population of about 246,000 inhabitants, almost twice that of the population census of 2008. From the estimated volume of municipal waste in 2010, the City calculates the population during the summer months at around 400,000 people, while official police sources estimated it at about 500,000, with a peak of up to 700,000 people.\n\n\n=== Gentilic names ===\nTraditionally the people of Marbella have been called \"marbelleros\" in popular language, and \"marbellenses\" in the liturgy; these names have appeared in dictionaries and encyclopedias. Since the mid-1950s, however, Marbellan residents have been called \"marbell\u00eds\" or \"marbell\u00edes\", the only gentilic, or demonym, that appears in the Diccionario de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola (Dictionary of the Spanish Language) published by the Royal Spanish Academy.The use of \"marbell\u00ed\" as a gentilic was popularised by the writer and journalist Victor de la Serna (1896\u20131958), who wrote a series of documentary articles on \"The Navy of Andaluc\u00eda\"; in his research he had come upon the Historia de M\u00e1laga y Su Provincia (History of M\u00e1laga and the Province) by Francisco Guill\u00e9n Robles, who used the plural word \"marbell\u00edes\" to designate the Muslim inhabitants of Marbella.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and antiquity ===\n\nArchaeological excavations have been made in the mountains around Marbella which point to human habitation in Paleolithic and Neolithic times. Some historians believe that the first settlement on the present site of Marbella was founded by the Phoenicians in the 7th century BC, as they are known to have established several colonies on the coast of M\u00e1laga province. However, no remains have been found of any significant settlement, although some artefacts of Phoenician and later Carthaginian settlements have been unearthed in different parts of the municipality, as in the fields of Rio Real and Cerro Torr\u00f3n.The existence of a Roman population centre in what is now the El Casco Antiguo (Old Town) is suggested by three Ionic capitals embedded in one section of the Murallas del Castillo (Moorish castle walls), the reused materials of a building from earlier times. Recent discoveries in La Calle Escuelas (School Street) and other remains scattered throughout the old town testify to a Roman occupation as well. West of the city on the grounds of the Hotel Puente Romano is a small 1st century Roman Bridge over a stream. There are ruins of other Roman settlements along the Verde and Guadalmina rivers: Villa Romana on the Rio Verde (Green River), the Roman baths at Guadalmina, and the ruins of a Roman villa and an early Byzantine basilica at Vega del Mar, built in the 3rd century and surrounded by a paleo-Christian necropolis, later used as a burial ground by the Visigoths. All of these further demonstrate a continued human presence in the area. In Roman times, the city was called Salduba (Salt City).\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nDuring the period of Islamic rule, after the Normans lay waste to the coast of M\u00e1laga in the 10th century, the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba fortified the coastline and built a string of several lighthouse towers along it. In the Umayyad fashion they constructed a citadel, the Alcazaba, and a wall to protect the town, which was made up of narrow streets and small buildings with large patios, the most notable buildings being the citadel and the mosque. The village was surrounded by orchards; its most notable crops were figs and mulberry trees for silkworm cultivation. The current name most likely developed from the name the Arabs gave it: Marbal\u00b7la (\u0645\u0631\u0628\u0644\u0629), which may in turn derive, according to some linguistic investigations, from a previous Iberian place name. The traveller Ibn Battuta characterised it as \"a pretty little town in a fertile district.\" During the time of the first kingdoms of Taifa, Marbil-la was disputed by the Taifas of Algeciras and of M\u00e1laga, eventually falling into the orbit of M\u00e1laga, which in turn later became part of the Nazarid Kingdom. In 1283 the  Marinid sultan Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd Al-Haqq launched a campaign against the Kingdom of Granada. Peace between the Marinid dynasty and the Nasrid dynasty was achieved with the signing of the Treaty of Marbella on 6 May 1286, by which all the Marinid possessions in Al-Andalus were restored to the Nazarid sultan.\n\n\n=== Early modern age ===\n\nOn 11 June 1485, the town passed into the hands of the Crown of Castile without bloodshed. The Catholic Monarchs gave Marbella the title of city and capital of the region and made it a realengo (royal protectorate). The Plaza de los Naranjos was built along the lines of Castilian urban design about this time, as well as some of the historical buildings that surround it. The Fuerte de San Luis de Marbella (Fort of San Luis) was built in 1554 by Charles V. The main door faced north and was protected by a moat with a drawbridge. Today, the ruins of the fort house a museum, and on the grounds are  the Iglesia del Santo Cristo de la Vera Cruz (Church of the Holy Christ of the True Cross) and Ermita del Calvario (Calvary Chapel). Sugar cane was introduced to Marbella in 1644, the cultivation of which spread on the M\u00e1laga province coast, resulting in the construction of numerous sugar mills, such as Trapiche del Prado de Marbella.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn 1828 M\u00e1laga businessman Manuel Agust\u00edn Heredia founded a company called La Concepci\u00f3n to mine the magnetite iron ores of the Sierra Blanca at nearby Oj\u00e9n, due to the availability of charcoal made from the trees of the mountain slopes and water from the Verde River, as a ready supply of both was needed for the manufacture of iron. In 1832 the company built the first charcoal-fired blast furnace for non-military use in Spain; these iron-smelting operations ultimately produced up to 75% of the country's cast iron. In 1860 the 1st Marquess of Duero founded an agricultural colony, now the heart of San Pedro de Alc\u00e1ntara. The dismantling of the iron industry based in the forges of El  Angel and La Concepci\u00f3n occurred simultaneously, disrupting the local economy, as much of the population had to return to farming or fishing for a livelihood. This situation was compounded by the widespread crisis of traditional agriculture, and by the epidemic of phylloxera blight in the vineyards, all of which accounted for Marbella's high unemployment, increase in poverty, and the starvation of many day labourers.\n\nThe associated infrastructure built for the installation of the foundry of El Angel in 1871 by the British-owned Marbella Iron Ore Company temporarily relieved the situation, and even made the city a destination for immigrants, increasing its population. However, the company did not survive the worldwide economic crisis of 1893, and closed its doors in that year due to the difficulty of finding a market for the magnetite iron ore removed from its mine.In the late 19th century, Marbella was a village composed of three parts: the main districts, the Barrio Alto or San Francisco, and the Barrio Nuevo. There were three smaller nuclei arranged around the old ironworks and the farm-model of the colony of San Pedro Alc\u00e1ntara, as well as isolated dwellings in orchards and farms. The general population was divided between a small group of oligarchs and the working people, the middle class being practically non-existent.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the early decades of the century the first hotels were built: the El Comercial, which opened in 1918, and the Miramar, which opened its doors in 1926. During the Second Republic, Marbella experienced major social changes and contentious political parties mobilized.\nAs the Spanish Civil War began, Marbella and Casare suffered more anticlerical violence than the rest of western M\u00e1laga province. The day after the failed uprising that led to the civil war, several religious buildings were set fire to in Marbella. Only the walls of the Church of St. Mary of the Incarnation and the Church of San Pedro Alcantara were left standing. With the aid of Fascist Italian troops, Nationalist forces seized Marbella during the first months of the war. It became a haven for prominent Nazis, including L\u00e9on Degrelle and Wolfgang Jugler, and Falangist personalities like Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gir\u00f3n de Velasco and Jos\u00e9 Ban\u00fas.After the Second World War, Marbella was a small jasmine-lined village with only 900 inhabitants. Ricardo Soriano, Marquis of Ivanrey, moved to Marbella and popularised it among his rich and famous friends. In 1943 he acquired a country estate located between Marbella and San Pedro called El Rodeo, and later built a resort there called Venta y Albergues El Rodeo, beginning the development of tourism in Marbella.Soriano's nephew, Prince Alfonso of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, descendant of a high-ranking aristocratic family (his mother Mar\u00eda de la Piedad de Yturbe y Scholtz-Hersmendorff, was the Marquesa de Belv\u00eds de las Navas) acquired another estate, Finca Santa Margarita. In 1954 he opened the Marbella Club, an international resort aimed at movie stars, business executives and the nobility. Both these resorts would be frequented by members of European aristocratic families with famous names: Bismarck, Rothschild, Thurn und Taxis, Metternich, de Mora y Aragon, de Salamanca or Thyssen-Bornemisza, thereby transforming Marbella into a destination for the international jet set. Trading on Prince Alfonso's kinship to the royal courts of Europe, the hotel quickly proved to be popular with vacationing members of Europe's social elites for its casual but discreet luxury. Jaime de Mora y Arag\u00f3n, a Spanish bon vivant and brother to Fabiola, Queen of the Belgians, as well as Adnan Khashoggi, were frequent visitors. Prince Alfonso's first marriage was to Princess Ira von F\u00fcrstenberg, an Agnelli heiress. Princess Marie-Louise of Prussia (great-granddaughter of Kaiser Wilhelm II) and her husband Count Rudolf \"Rudi\" von Sch\u00f6nburg\u2013Glauchau eventually worked closely with the new proprietors, the Shamoon family, who took over the Marbella Club Hotel from Prince Alfonso.\n\nIn 1966, Prince Alfonso brought in a Beverly Hills architect and, with the assistance of the Banus family, who were personal friends of dictator Francisco Franco and had already developed the later-controversial Valle de los Ca\u00eddos, developed the high-end tourist resort Puerto Banus. The resort opened to much fanfare in 1970. Celebrities in attendance included Franco's designated successor, Juan Carlos (then Prince of Asturias), Prince Rainier of Monaco and his wife Grace Kelly, and Aga Khan IV; entertainers included Julio Iglesias. In 1973, exiled dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zald\u00edvar, who had left Cuba with a fortune estimated at between $100 and $300 million and lived extravagantly in various Iberian resorts, died of a heart attack there. Fugitive financier Marc Rich bought a house in Marbella, renounced his American citizenship and claimed Spanish citizenship during his decades of evading American income taxes, although he spent more time (and died) in Switzerland.\nIn 1974, Prince Fahd arrived in Marbella from Montecarlo. Until his death in 2005, Prince Fahd was a frequent and profligate guest; Marbella welcomed his retinue of over a thousand people spending petro-dollars. The then-anonymous Osama bin Laden visited on a number of occasions with his family between 1977 and 1988.\n\nIn the 1980s, Marbella continued as a popular jet set destination. However, the 1987 kidnapping of Melodie Nakachian, the daughter of local billionaire philanthropist Raymond Nakachian and the Korean singer Kimera, focused less-favourable international media scrutiny on Marbella, even though a police raid ultimately freed her.From the first democratic elections after the adoption of the 1978 Spanish Constitution, until 1991, all the mayors of Marbella were members of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party ('El Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol' or PSOE in Spanish).In 1991, the builder and president of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Jes\u00fas Gil was elected mayor of Marbella by a wide majority. He and his party, the right-wing populist Independent Liberal Group ('Grupo Independiente Liberal' or GIL in Spanish), promised to fight petty crime as well as the region's declining prestige. Actor Sean Connery became Marbella's international spokesman, although Connery later ended this business relationship after Gil used his image in an election campaign. Gil's administration facilitated a building boom. However, critics complained about disregard for the existing urban plan, market speculation and environmental predation by developers; the regional Andalusian government suspended some development. Gil despised town-hall formalities, instead ruling from his office at the Club Financiero, and cultivated a maverick image. The PSOE and the People's Party criticized Gil even at the national level, but voters re-elected him\u2014and Spanish celebrities continued to spend summers there. Gil's political party, GIL, also proved popular in other tourist-dependent Costa del Sol towns like Estepona, and even across the Strait of Gibraltar to the Spanish North African cities of Ceuta and Melilla.\nIn 1999, Gil was convicted of embezzling public funds and falsifying public documents. Gil died in 2004, and his party remained in power until 2006, but related scandals continue to this day, as discussed below.\n\n\n== Landmarks and places of interest ==\n\n\n=== Old Town (Casco Antiguo) ===\nThe old town of Marbella includes the ancient city walls and the two historical suburbs of the city, the Barrio Alto, which extends north, and the Barrio Nuevo, located to the east. The ancient walled city retains nearly the same layout as in the 16th century. Here is the Plaza de los Naranjos, an example of Castilian Renaissance design, its plan laid out in the heart of Old Town after the Christian reconquest. Around the square are arranged three remarkable buildings: the town hall, built in 1568 by the Catholic Monarchs in Renaissance style, the Mayor's house, which combines Gothic and Renaissance elements in its fa\u00e7ade, with a roof of Mudejar style and fresco murals inside, and the Chapel of Santiago, the oldest religious building in the city, built earlier than the square and not aligned with it, believed to date from the 15th century. Other buildings of interest in the centre are the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda de la Encarnaci\u00f3n, built in the Baroque style starting in 1618, the Casa del Roque, and the remains of the Arabic castle and defensive walls; also in the  Renaissance style are the Capilla de San Juan de Dios (Chapel of St. John of God), the Hospital Real de la Misericordia (Royal Hospital of Mercy) and the Hospital Baz\u00e1n which now houses the Museum of Contemporary Spanish Engravings.\n\nOne of the highlights of the Barrio Alto is the Ermita del Santo Cristo de la Vera Cruz (Hermitage of the Holy Christ of the True Cross), built in the 15th century and enlarged in the 18th century, which consists of a square tower with a roof covered by glazed ceramic tiles. The Barrio Alto is also known as the San Francisco neighborhood, after a Franciscan convent formerly located there. The so-called Nuevo Barrio (New Town), separated from the walled city by the Arroyo de la Represa, has no monumental buildings but retains its original layout and much of its character in the simple whitewashed houses with their tiled roofs and exposed wooden beams, orchards and small corrals.\n\n\n=== Historic extension (Ensanche hist\u00f3rico) ===\n\nBetween the old town and the sea in the area known as the \"historic extension\" (ensanche hist\u00f3rico), there is a small botanical garden on Paseo de la Alameda, and a garden with fountains and a collection of ten sculptures by Salvador Dal\u00ed on the Avenida del Mar, which connects the old town with the beach. To the west of this road, passing the Faro de Marbella, is Constitution Park (Parque de la Constituci\u00f3n), which houses the auditorium of the same name and the Skol Apartments, designed in the Modernist style by the Spanish architect Manuel Ja\u00e9n Albaitero.\n\n\n=== Marbella's Golden Mile ===\nWhat is known as Marbella's Golden Mile is actually a stretch of four miles (6.4 km) which begins at the western edge of Marbella city and stretches to Puerto Ban\u00fas. The area is home to some of Marbella's most luxurious villas and estates with views of mountain and sea, such as the Palace of King Fahd, as well as some landmark hotels, among them the Melia Don Pepe, the Hotel Marbella Club and the Hotel Puente Romano.  The area developed during the tourism boom of the 1960s, where may be found the ruins of the Roman villa by the Rio Verde, and El \u00c1ngel, where the land of the old forge works was converted to an agricultural colony, and the Botanical Gardens of El \u00c1ngel with gardens of three different styles, dating from the 8th century.\nThe Golden Mile is divided into two parts by a motorway that runs through it. Along the motorway are strings of business centres, five-star hotels, golf course and other services. The beachside of the motorway is fully developed, while the mountain side is still undergoing development. Urbanisations in the area's sea side are Alhambra del Mar, La Alcazaba, Las Torres, Los Verdiales, Marbellamar, Marina Marbella, Oasis, Rio Verde and Santa Margarita. On the mountainside of the motorway, the following residential areas are currently being developed: Sierra Blanca, Nag\u00fceles, Cascada de Camoj\u00e1n, Jardines Colgantes, Marbella Hill Club, El Venero, El Batatal, La Capellania, La Virginia, Carolina, El Vicario, Altos de Salamanca, Casas del Se\u00f1orio de Marbella, Coto Real, and Ancon Sierra.The Golden Mile should not be confused with the New Golden Mile which is a marketing name given to the area between San Pedro de Alcantara and Estepona.\n\n\n=== Nueva Andaluc\u00eda ===\nNueva Andaluc\u00eda is an area just west of Marbella and inland from the marina of Puerto Ban\u00fas. Home to many golf courses, it is also known as Golf Valley. The bullring by Centro Plaza marks the entrance to Nueva Andalucia where the villas and apartments are based on traditional Andalusian architecture and design. Nueva Andalucia is a very popular residential area both due to tis three golf courses, but also due to an increasing number of restaurants and entertainment venues. The three golf courses in Nueva Andalucia are Los Naranjos Golf Club, Las Brisas Golf Club and Aloha Golf \n\n\n=== San Pedro Alc\u00e1ntara ===\nAt the heart of San Pedro Alc\u00e1ntara are two industrial buildings of the 19th century: the Trapiche de Guadaiza and the sugar mill, which now houses the Ingenio Cultural Centre. The 19th century heritage of San Pedro is also represented by two buildings of colonial style, the parish Church and the Villa of San Luis, residence of the Marqu\u00e9s del Duero. Next to San Pedro, near the mouth of the river Guadalmina, are some of the most important archaeological sites in Marbella: the early Christian Bas\u00edlica de Vega del Mar, the vaulted Roman baths of Las B\u00f3vedas (the Domes) and the eponymous watch tower of Torre de Las B\u00f3vedas. The important archaeological site of Cerro Colorado is located near Benahavis; it features a chronologically complex stratigraphy that begins in the 4th century BC within a Mastieno (ancient Iberian ethnicity of the Tartessian confederation) area, then a town identified as Punic, and finally a Roman settlement. A series of domestic structures built behind the city walls, and corresponding to these different stages of occupation recorded in the archaeological sequence of the site, characterise the settlement as being fortified. A hoard of three pots filled with silver coins of mostly Hispano-Carthaginian origin, and numerous pieces of precious metalwork, along with clippings and silver ingots, all dating from the 3rd century BC, were found here.\n\n\n=== District of Las Chapas ===\nIn the eastern part of the municipality in the district of Las Chapas is the site of Rio Real, situated on a promontory near the mouth of the river of the same name. Here traces of Phoenician habitation dating to the early 7th century BC were discovered in excavations made during an archaeological expedition led by Pedro S\u00e1nchez in 1998. Bronze Age utensils including plates, carinated bowls, lamps and other ceramics of Phoenician and indigenous Iberian types have been found, as well as a few Greek examples. There are two ancient watchtowers, the Torre R\u00edo Real (Royal River Tower) and the Torre Ladrones (Tower of Thieves). Among the notable tourist attractions is the residential complex Ciudad Residencial Tiempo Libre (Residential Leisure City), an architectural ensemble of the Modernist movement, which has been a registered property of Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural (Heritage of Cultural Interest) since 2006.\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\n\nThe 27 kilometres (17 miles) of coastline within the limits of Marbella is divided into twenty-four beaches with different features; however, due to expansion of the municipality, they are all now semi-urban. They generally have moderate surf, golden or dark sand ranging through fine, medium or coarse in texture, and some gravel. The occupancy rate is usually high to midrange, especially during the summer months, when tourist arrivals are highest. Amongst the various notable beaches are Artola beach, situated in the protected area of the Dunas de Artola, and Cabopino, one of the few nudist beaches in Marbella, near the port of Cabopino. The beaches of Venus and La Fontanilla are centrally located and very popular, and those of Puerto Ban\u00fas and San Pedro Alc\u00e1ntara have been awarded the blue flag of the Foundation for Environmental Education for compliance with its standards of water quality, safety, general services and environmental management.\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\nPolitical administration of the municipal government is run by the Ayuntamiento (City Hall), whose members are elected every four years. Maria Angeles Mu\u00f1oz, leader of the People's Party (PP) in Marbella, became mayor in 2007, and her party has governed the town ever since. The electoral roll is composed of all residents registered in Marbella who are over age 18 and a citizen of Spain or one of the other member states of the European Union. The Spanish Law on the General Election sets the number of councilors elected according to the municipality's population; the Municipal Corporation of Marbella consists of 27 councilors.\n\n\n=== Gil Cases ===\nCorruption accusations and mayor Gil's further conviction in 2002 for diverting public funds to Atl\u00e9tico led to reappraisal of the city's finances. When Jes\u00fas Gil y Gil finally resigned that year, he was succeeded by Juli\u00e1n Mu\u00f1oz, his right-hand man, a former waiter famous for his romantic involvement with singer Isabel Pantoja, a matador's widow. After a power struggle in which Mu\u00f1oz fired Juan Antonio Roca Nicolas, a planning consultant, for involvement in the Gil-era scandal and in the later scandal discussed below, the city council censured the new mayor and expelled him from office. More than 79 companies and 85 individuals were implicated in the initial corruption scandal (for which Roca had been released from prison upon paying a 450,000 euro fine), and an additional fifty persons and more companies were convicted in June 2013. In a televised debate, Mu\u00f1oz and Gil each accused the other of having robbed public funds.After his own party repudiated Mu\u00f1oz, Marisol Yag\u00fce, a former secretary, became Marbella's new mayor, but was herself arrested and jailed in March 2006. Deputy Mayor Isabel Garcia Marcos was arrested at Malaga's airport en route to a honeymoon in Russia at this time, and police found over \u20ac360,000 in cash in a safe in her home. Garcia, a Socialist until her expulsion from that party in 2003, had been known for criticizing Marbella's endemic corruption. Gil died in 2004, a year after Spain's Supreme Court barred him from holding further public office for 28 years for breach of trust and influence-peddling in the earlier cases, as well as shortly after a lower court ordered him to surrender his Atl\u00e9tico shares and fined him $16 million in connection with the 2002 conviction (but allowed him to remain free on bail during his appeal).\n\n\n=== Operation Malaya ===\n\nIn March 2006, Marbella seemed nearly bankrupt. City councilor Tom\u00e1s Re\u00f1ones, a former Atl\u00e9tico Madrid football player, ran Marbella after Mayor Yague and Deputy Mayor Garcia were jailed, but soon ended up in jail as well. On 8 April 2006, the Spanish Senate unanimously approved the report of the General Commission of Autonomous Communities and suspended the city council, the first time such a course of action had occurred in Spain since democracy's restoration. Spain's Prime Minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, head of the national PSOE, appointed a committee of auditors to run Marbella temporarily, as well as unravel the financial machinations.\nAfter a short period of interim government, municipal elections were held in May 2007. For the first time, the People's Party (PP) gained a majority, with 16 out of the 27 council seats. The PSOE won 10 council seats, United Left (IU) had 1. In the municipal elections of May 2011, the PP won 15 seats, the PSOE 7, the IU 2, and three independents elected.\n\nThe investigation, known as the Operation Malaya case, has resulted in numerous convictions and the seizure of goods worth 2.4 million euros. Today \"Marbellan urbanism\" is synonymous in Spain with governmental corruption, with as many as 30,000 illegal homes built in the town, without significant educational and health infrastructure.During the complex, three-year trial (which included over 300 hours of hearings and 400 witnesses), evidence showed that under a scheme masterminded by Roca (a formerly unemployed builder who ran the city's planning department in the 1990s), building permits were issued in exchange for envelopes of cash, and the money then illegally laundered. Although prosecutors had sought even stiffer terms after convicting 50 municipal officials and business executives, in October 2013, Roca was sentenced to 11 years in jail and fined 240m euros, former mayor Mu\u00f1oz sentenced to six years, and former mayor Yag\u00fce sentenced to serve two years in prison. Forty of the 95 accused were found not guilty by the Malaga court.The corruption investigation that led to this round of convictions began in 2005, as an investigation into drug moneylaundering. Roca reportedly claimed to control the town after Gil's death. At the height of his wealth he was one of the richest men in Andalucia, having accumulated several hotels, ranches with more than 103 thoroughbred horses and fighting bulls, a private jet, a helicopter, 14 vintage cars, 5 kilos of jewellery and a 275 piece art collection including Miro paintings. However, although Marbella's population had boomed to approximately 160,000 residents during the previous fifteen years, neither additional schools nor health centres were built; the city's infrastructure remained virtually unchanged since 1991. Although the city expanded its workforce from 400 employees in 1991 to 3,200 in 2006, under the GIL administrations Marbella paid neither social security contributions nor taxes for its employees. The town's debt now exceeds over 200 million euros and precludes necessary infrastructure improvements. Hundreds of the poorly built apartments and homes, many sold to expatriate British and Irish retirees, face demolition as hazardous. Investigating magistrate Miguel Angel Torres Segura, who led the investigations through 2007, was promoted to the criminal court in Granada.\n\n\n=== Symbols ===\nThe design of the coat of arms and the flag used by Marbella City Hall has been the subject of controversy. According to some sources, GIL changed these symbols without any consensus or heraldic rigour, nor had they been vetted by the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, so that different factions claim the rehabilitation of the shield granted by the Catholic Monarchs to the city in 1493 and official recognition of a flag designed in accordance with prevailing standards of vexillology.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAccording to 2003 data, Marbella is amongst the municipalities ranking highest in household disposable income per capita in Andalusia, second to Moj\u00e1car and matched by four other municipalities, including its neighbour, Benahav\u00eds.\nIts business sector consisted of 17,647 establishments in 2005, representing a total of 14.7% of the businesses in Malaga province, and showed greater dynamism than the provincial capital itself for growth over the period 1998\u20132004, when it grew 9% compared to the 2.4% growth rate of M\u00e1laga. Compared to the rest of Andalusia, the volume of production in Marbella is higher than that of most other municipalities with similar population, ranking even above the capitals of Almeria, Huelva and Jaen.\n\nAs in most cities of the Andalusian coast, Marbella's economy revolves around tertiary activities. The service sector accounts for 60% of employment, while trade accounts for almost 20%. The main branches of the service sector are hospitality, real estate and business services, which fact underscores the importance of tourism in the Marbella economy. Meanwhile, the construction, industrial and agriculture sectors account for 14.2%, 3.8% and 2.4% of employment respectively.\nThe number of business establishments in the service sector accounts for 87.5% of the total, those in construction account for 9.6%, and in industry, 2.9%. Of these companies, 89.5% have fewer than 5 employees and only 2.3% have a staff of at least 20 employees.\nIn 2008 a study by the Institute of Statistics of Andalusia (IEA) based on 14 variables (income, equipment, training, etc.), found Marbella was the Andalusian city with the best development of the general welfare and the highest quality of life. According to the results of the study, Marbella ranks highest in the number of private clinics, sports facilities and private schools.In December 2016, an investment fund based in Hong Kong announced that it had acquired 170,000 square metres of land near Elviria and planned to invest EUR 300 million to develop a five-star luxury hotel and 120 villas. According to its developer, the future resort \"is to be the most luxurious in the country\" and will be run by an international hotel chain.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nCities on the coast are accessible by bus from Marbella, including M\u00e1laga, Estepona, Torremolinos, Fuengirola and Gibraltar. The area is also served by the A7 motorway; the closest airport is M\u00e1laga-Costa Del Sol.\n\n\n=== Marine shipping ===\nThe four ports of Marbella are primarily recreational; although both Puerto Ban\u00fas and the Puerto de la Bajadilla are permitted to dock cruise ships, neither operates regular service to other ports. The port of Bajadilla is also home to the fishermen's guild of Marbella and is used for the transport of goods.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nMarbella is the most populous municipality in the Iberian Peninsula without a railway station in its territory, and is the only Spanish city of over 100,000 inhabitants not served by rail.An infrastructure project is underway for the construction of the Corridor of Costa del Sol rail system to connect Nerja, M\u00e1laga and Algeciras, possibly to include a high speed railway, with several stops planned for Marbella. Until then the nearest station is near Fuengirola, 27 km (17 miles) distant, further away is M\u00e1laga Maria Zambrano, located in M\u00e1laga city, 57 km (35 miles) away, and Ronda railway station, also 57 km (35 miles).\n\n\n=== Urban bus ===\nMarbella offers residents of the municipality free mobility on its urban bus lines (Urbanos de Marbella) operated by Avanza, thanks to the Tarjeta Municipal de Movilidad. There are currently 10 urban bus lines, spanning from San Pedro de Alc\u00e1ntara to Cabopino, in addition to the temporary Starlite line available during summers.\n\n\n=== Intercity bus ===\nMost intercity bus services are operated by CTSA-Portillo, communicating with major urban centres of the Costa del Sol, including M\u00e1laga and its airport, and nearby towns in the interior (Benahavis, Ojen, Ronda), as well as the Campo including Gibraltar (La Linea and Algeciras), some of the major cities of Andalusia (Almer\u00eda, C\u00e1diz, C\u00f3rdoba, Jerez, Granada, Jaen, Seville and \u00dabeda)  and M\u00e9rida in Extremadura. The central bus station has connections to other domestic destinations, Madrid and Barcelona.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nThere are always plenty of taxis to Marbella available from the Malaga or Gibraltar airports or from the different taxi ranks along the Costa del Sol; most of them are clean and non-smoking, as well as being the most comfortable way of travelling to local holiday destinations.\nMarbella is not formally integrated into the Metropolitan Transportation Consortium M\u00e1laga area.\n\n\n== Media ==\nGiven the ethnic diversity of the city, Marbella's newspapers and magazines are published in several European languages, among which are La Tribuna de Marbella (Spanish), and Costa del Sol Nachrichten (in German). In addition, Diario Sur (Spanish) or Southern Journal (in English) and La Opini\u00f3n de M\u00e1laga (Spanish) have editorial offices in the city. Among the magazines with the largest circulation are  those dedicated to fashion and lifestyle, such as Absolute Marbella, Essential Magazine, The European Magazine, Transform Magazine (all in English), and Das Aktuelle Spanienmagazin (in German). Golf Andalusia and Golf Spain magazines, monthly Spanish-English bilingual magazines with a total circulation of 45,000 copies, are distributed throughout Spain.\nMarbella has several local television stations, such as M95 Television, Summer TV and South Coast Television and several digital news dailies including the Voice of Marbella and Journal of Marbella.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBesides the typical Andalusian cultural events, a variety of annual festivals are held in Marbella, mainly between June and October; other events are held sporadically. Festivals dedicated to music include the Marbella International Opera Festival held in August since 2001, the Marbella Reggae Festival in July, and the Marbella International Film Festival in June at different locations around the city\u2014amongst them the beach, aboard a boat or in Old Town. It also hosts the Marbella International Film Festival, the Spanish Film Festival and the Festival of Independent Theatre.\nTo provide venues for these and other events, the city has cultural facilities both publicly and privately managed, such as the Auditorium of Constitution Park, the Ingenio Cultural Centre, the Teatro Ciudad de Marbella or Black Box Theatre, among others. In addition, there is a music conservatory, a cinema club and several cinemas showing foreign films dubbed into Castilian.\nThe International Contemporary Art Fair I, also known as MARB ART, was held in Marbella in 2005, exhibiting works of photography, painting, sculpture and graphic design by over 500 artists; it has been held annually since at the Palace of Congresses. The following year the 2006 extension of the Ateneo de M\u00e1laga Marbella (Atheneum of M\u00e1laga Marbella) opened, dedicated to the development of artistic and cultural activities.\nAmongst local cultural associations is the Cilniana Association, an organisation dedicated to protecting and promoting the heritage of Marbella and neighbouring towns, which publishes its own magazine. Since 2009 the city has been home to Marbella University, the first private university in the province of M\u00e1laga. In 2013, the city welcomed the opening of Marbella International University Centre (MIUC), an international higher-education institution focused on Business, Politics and Media, and the only university in Andalusia where courses are taught in both English and Spanish.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nContemporary Spanish Engraving Museum: created in 1992, contains a collection of prints by 20th century artists such as Picasso, Mir\u00f3, Dal\u00ed, T\u00e0pies, Chillida and the El Paso Group (Rafael Canogar, Manolo Millares, Antonio Saura, Pablo Serrano, et al.) amongst others, as well as an exhibition hall dedicated to teaching engraving techniques.\nMuseum Cortijo de Miraflores: in addition to the museum, the farm houses an exhibition hall and other cultural classrooms, amongst them the olive oil mill.\nBonsai Museum: opened in 1992, it has a collection of specimens on permanent display and others for sale, with an emphasis on its extensive collection of olive trees and examples of species such as Ginkgo, Oxicedro, Pentafila Pino, and zelcoba, also pines, oaks, and other species.\nRalli Museum, dedicated primarily to art in Latin America, it has sculptures by Dal\u00ed and Aristide Maillol and paintings by Dal\u00ed, Mir\u00f3,  Chagall, Henry Moore, amongst others.\nMunicipal Archaeological Collection: its collection consists of archaeological artefacts found in the municipality.\nMechanical Art Museum: a cultural centre located in the 19th-century Barriada del Ingenio, it contains sculptures made from second-hand car parts by Antonio Alonso.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThe traditional cuisine of Marbella is that of the Malague\u00f1o coast and is based on seafood. The most typical dish is fried fish, using anchovies, mackerel, mullet or squid, amongst others. Gazpacho and garlic soup are very typical. Bakeries sell oil cakes, wine donuts, borrachuelos (aniseed rolls fried with a little wine and dipped into syrup), torrijas (similar to French toast) and churros (fritters). In addition to the traditional native cuisine, there are many restaurants in Marbella that serve food of the international, nouvelle, or fusion cuisines.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nIn June, the Fair and Fiesta of San Bernabe is celebrated to honour the patron saint of Marbella. For a week there are various activities and performances which are divided into two parts: Fair Day, which began in Old Town and is now held in the Avenida del Doctor Ma\u00edz Vi\u00f1als and Fair Night, which takes place in Arroyo Primero.\nIn October the fair and festivals in honour of the patron saint of San Pedro Alcantara are celebrated, which also last a full week. The smaller Fair and Festivals of Nueva Andaluc\u00eda celebrated in early October in Las Chapas and El \u00c1ngel are also popular. \nThroughout the summer season (July to October) most barrios of Marbella have  events organised by neighbourhood associations to encourage cultural activities including: bullfights, musical performances, photo competitions and sporting events. Among the best known associations are those of Santa Marta, Salto del Agua, Leganitos, Divina Pastora, Trapiche, Plaza de Toros and Miraflores.\nOther festivals and local celebrations include the Pilgrimages of Cruz de Juanar (May), La Virgen del Carmen (July) and La Virgen Madre (August), as well as the D\u00eda del Tost\u00f3n (November), a traditional celebration which consists of going to the fields to roast chestnuts.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe British School of Marbella (British school)\nDeutsche Schule M\u00e1laga (German school)Marbella International University Center (MIUC)\nSvenska skolan Marbella (Swedish school)\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe city is especially popular with tourists from Northern Europe (including the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany) and also Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Marbella is particularly noted for the presence of aristocrats, celebrities and wealthy people; it is a popular destination for luxury yachts, and increasingly so for cruise ships, which dock in its harbour.The area is popular with golfers and boaters, and there are many private estates and luxury hotels in the vicinity, including the Marbella Club Hotel. Marbella hosts a WTA tennis tournament on red clay, the Andalucia Tennis Experience.\nSights in or near Marbella include:\n\nArabian wall\nBonsai museum\nMuseo del Grabado Espa\u00f1ol Contempor\u00e1neo\nOld city centre\nPlaya de la Bajadilla (beach)\nPlaya de Fontanilla (beach)\nPuerto Ban\u00fas, a marina built by Jos\u00e9 Ban\u00fas\nThe Golden Mile featuring the Marbella Club Hotel and its beach club, as well as the late King Fahd's palace.\nEncarnation's Church (Iglesia de la Encarnaci\u00f3n).

          "We did not enter the church, but went up the long hill to get some exercise and to get a view of the Alhambra, city of Granada and the countryside. One walks through some small streets of the Albaicin. While there are many potential routes, it seems selecting streets that are",

          "This little closed church is at the top of the hill overlooking the Alhambra and Granada. Came up here as part of the Walk in Granada Sacromonte tour. It took over an hour from Plaza Nueva and the way up was mostly twisting, very narrow roads and then the last part was a series",

          "Great views of the city and the walk is very pleasant. The town below Albaic\u00edn is great for alfresco tapas. So you can charge up the hill to the top, enjoy the view then reward yourself with a well earned drink. It's lovely and peaceful up there, a lovely chilled vibe and also",

        "wiki": "The Alc\u00e1zar de los Reyes Cristianos (Spanish for \"Castle of the Christian Monarchs\"), also known as the Alc\u00e1zar of C\u00f3rdoba, is a medieval alc\u00e1zar (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0631\u200e, romanized: Al-Qasr, lit. 'The Palace') located in the historic centre of C\u00f3rdoba (in Andalusia, Spain), next to the Guadalquivir River and near the Grand Mosque. The fortress served as one of the primary residences of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon.\nIt is a building of military character whose construction was ordered by the King Alfonso XI of Castile in the year 1328, on previous constructions (the Al-Andalusian Alc\u00e1zar, also previous residence of the Roman Governor and the Customs). The architectural ensemble has a sober character in its exterior and splendid in its interior, with the magnificent gardens and courtyards that maintain a Mud\u00e9jar inspiration.\nThe Alc\u00e1zar has been declared a Cultural Interest Heritage since 1931. It forms part of the Historic Center of C\u00f3rdoba that was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn early medieval times, the site was occupied by a Visigoth fortress.  When the Visigoths fell to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, the emirs of the Umayyad Caliphate in Damascus rebuilt the structure.  The Umayyads fell to the Abbasid Caliphate and the surviving member of the Umayyad Dynasty, Abd ar-Rahman I, fled to C\u00f3rdoba.  Abd ar-Rahman I's successors established the independent Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba and used the Alc\u00e1zar as their palace. The city subsequently flourished as a key political and cultural center, and the Alc\u00e1zar was expanded into a very large and widely used area with baths, gardens, and the largest library in the West. Watermills on the nearby Guadalquivir powered water lifting to irrigate the extensive gardens.\nIn 1236, Christian forces took C\u00f3rdoba during the Reconquista.  In 1328, Alfonso XI of Castile  began building the present day structure on part of the site for the old fortress.  Other parts of the Moorish Alc\u00e1zar had been given as spoils to the bishop, nobles, and the Order of Calatrava. Alfonso's structure retained only part of the Moorish ruins but the structure appears Islamic due to Alfonso's use of the Mud\u00e9jar style.\nThe Alc\u00e1zar was involved in the civil war where Henry IV of Castile faced a rebellion that backed his teenage half-brother Alfonso.  During the war, the Alc\u00e1zar's defenses were upgraded to deal with the advent of gunpowder.  At the same time, the Alc\u00e1zar's main tower, now known as the \"Tower of the Inquisition\" was constructed.Henry's successor, Isabella and her husband, Ferdinand, used the Alc\u00e1zar for one of the first permanent tribunals of the Spanish Inquisition and as a headquarters for their campaign against the Nasrid dynasty in Granada, the last remaining Moorish kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula.  The Inquisition began using the Alc\u00e1zar as one of its headquarters in 1482, converting much of it, including the Arab baths, into torture and interrogation chambers.  The Inquisition maintained a tribunal here for three centuries. Boabdil was held prisoner here in 1483 until he promised to make Granada a tributary state. When Boabdil refused to surrender his kingdom in 1489, the Christians launched an attack.  Isabella and Ferdinand's campaign against Granada succeeded in 1492.  The same year, the monarchs met Christopher Columbus in the Alc\u00e1zar as he prepared to take his first voyage to the Americas.The Alc\u00e1zar served as a garrison for Napoleon Bonaparte's troops in 1810.  In 1821, the Alc\u00e1zar became a prison.  Finally, the Spanish government made the Alc\u00e1zar a tourist attraction and national monument in the 1950s.\n\n\n== Exterior ==\n\n\n=== Towers ===\n\nThe outdoor area of the Alc\u00e1zar is situated within the walls of the four towers (Paloma, Leones, Homenaje and Inquisici\u00f3n), this creating an almost square shape to the building.\nTower of Homage (La torre del Homenaje), of octagonal shape, is situated in the Northeast corner. The tower was previously known as  \u2018The Clock Tower\u2019 (Torre del Reloj), owing its name to the clock that was previously house within.\nTower of the Lions (La torre de los Leones), of square shape, is situated in the Northwest corner. The door to the base of this tower is currently used as the visitor entrance to the Alc\u00e1zar. It is the longest standing tower, dating back to the 13th Century, and is named after gargoyles in the shape of lions which are found on the uppermost section of the tower. Within the tower there are two floors; the ground floor, where the reception can be found, and the upper level which accommodates the Chapel of San Eustaquio (La capilla de San Eustaquio), which served as the chapel to the Catholic Kings.\nTower of the inquisition (La torre de la Inquisici\u00f3n), of circular shape, is situated in the Southwest corner. It receives its name from the fact that, for centuries, it housed the archives of the Tribunal of the Holy Inquisition (Tribunal de la Santa Inquisition). It was also known as the \u2018Tower of the Gardens\u2019 (Torre de los Jardines\u2019).\nTower of the Dove (La torre de la Paloma), of square shape, is situated in the Southeast corner. The original tower was demolished in the mid-19th century, the current tower being a reconstruction which dates back to the second half of the 20th century. It was also known as \u2018The Watch Tower\u2019 (Torre de la Vela).\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\n\n=== Hall of Mosaics (Sal\u00f3n de los Mosaicos) ===\nThe main hall of the building, constructed in the 18th century, is referred to as the \u201cHall of Mosaics\u201d, given the impressive Mosaics that can be found within the hall. The mosaics on show were discovered at the Corredera Square (Plaza de la Corredera) towards the end of the  1950s and formed part of the Roman Circus, as well as a sarcophagus from the 3rd Century. The hall is currently a highly sought after civil marriage location by many Cordoban citizens.Beneath the current floor of the hall, it is still possible to discover the remains of which are believed to be from the Royal Baths which were used by high dignitaries during the Muslim era.\n\n\n=== Courtyard of the Moriscos (Patio Morisco) ===\nThe courtyard of the Moriscos, also known as the Mudejar Courtyard, is situated to the western side of the Alc\u00e1zar. Taking on a square floor plan, it is surrounded by arched verandas with the exception of its western face. The western face of the patio is where the wall that connects the Tower of the Lions and the Tower of the Inquisition is found, and also through which the Gardens of the Alc\u00e1zar (Jardines del Alc\u00e1zar) can be accessed. The patio is centred by a water fountain which sits in-between two ponds.\n\n\n=== Courtyard of the Women (Patio de las mujeres) ===\nThe courtyard of the Women, also known as the eastern courtyard, is situated to the eastern side of the Alc\u00e1zar. It owes its name to the era during which the Alc\u00e1zar was used as a prison, with this courtyard being the location where the feminine section of the prison was located. Many archaeological remains from the different constructive phases of the Alc\u00e1zar are found in this courtyard, as well as remains of former buildings, the Roman castellum and the Andalusian Alc\u00e1zar.\n\n\n=== Reception Hall (Sala de recepciones) ===\nThe reception hall, also known as the Ocean Hall, is a room of square plan which is situated beside the Hall of Mosaics. Incrusted in one of the walls is a Roman mosaic, dedicated to the God Oceanus. Also within the hall are found some seats of honor of the ancient chapter choir which date back to the 17th Century.\n\n\n=== Royal Baths of Do\u00f1a Leonor (Ba\u00f1os reales de Do\u00f1a Leonor) ===\n\nThe Royal Baths were constructed in 1328 by King Alfonso the 11th. They were structured into four rooms: the changing room, the cold room, the temperate room and the hot room. They owe their name to Leonor de Guzm\u00e1n, the King's mistress, in whose honour the Royal Baths were constructed.\n\n\n== Gardens of the Alc\u00e1zar (Jardines del Alc\u00e1zar) ==\nThe old Alc\u00e1zar orchard has been transformed into an impressive area of approximately 55,000m\u00b2 of magnificent gardens with forest species including palm, cypress, orange and lemon trees, which surround a number of elegant fountains and ponds. The gardens are structured on three levels: the upper garden, the middle garden and the lower garden.\nThe King's walk (El paseo de los reyes) is a walk bordered by a line of cylindrical cypress trees and is also divided into two paths by two narrow ponds. On this walk, there are several sculptures of the Kings who built the Alc\u00e1zar, which are located on pedestals aligned between the hedges.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Alc\u00e1zar centers on the Patio Morisco (\"Courtyard of the Moriscos\"), another popular feature.  There are two towers: the Torre de los Leones (\"Tower of the Lions) and the Torre de Homenaje (\"Tower of Homage\"). The latter has Gothic features including an ogival ceiling.A series of Roman mosaics and a Roman sarcophagus are displayed in the Inquisition Tower.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCaballerizas Reales (Royal Stables)Alc\u00e1zar andalus\u00ed (Andalusian Alc\u00e1zar)Historic Centre of C\u00f3rdoba\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nC\u00f3rdoba Royal Fortress - Alc\u00e1zar de los Reyes Cristianos\nMore tourist information\nMore historical information",

        "wiki": "The Court of the Myrtles (Patio de los Arrayanes) is part of the palace and fortress complex of the Alhambra. It is located east of the Gilded Room (Cuarto Dorado) and west of the Patio of the Lions and the Baths. Its current name is due to the myrtle bushes that surround the central pond and the bright green colour of which contrasts with the white marble of the patio. It was also called the Patio of the Pond or the Reservoir (Patio del Estanque o de la Alberca) because of the central pond, which is 34 metres long and 7,10 meters wide. The patio is divided in two sides by the pond, which receives its water from two fountains. The space has chambers and porticoes around it. These porticoes rest on columns with cubic capitals, which have seven semicircular arches decorated with fretwork rhombuses and inscriptions praising God. The central arch is greater than the other six and has solid scallops decorated with stylised vegetal forms and capitals of Moc\u00e1rabes.\nThe most important chambers that surround the Patio are the ones in the north side, which are part of the Comares Palace, the official residence of the King.\n\n\n== Comares Palace ==\nThe name of the Palace, Comares, has led to various etymological research. For instance, Diego de Guadix wrote a dictionary about Arabic words in which it is said that Comares originally comes from cun and ari. The first term means stand up and the second one look, in other words it would have meant Stand up and look around or possibly Open your eyes and see, which is a way of referring the beauty of the place.In the sixteenth century, a historian from Granada called Luis de M\u00e1rmol Carvajal claimed that the term Comares derived from the word Comarax\u00eda, that actually has a meaning related to a craftsmanship labor very appreciated by Muslims: a manufacturing technique of glass for exterior and ceilings.A third suggested theory is that the name comes from the Arab word qumariyya or qamariyya. These ones designate the stained glasses that can even be glimpsed from the Hall of the Ambassadors' balcony.There's another possibility that says that Qumarish is the name of a region in the North of Africa where most craftsmen came from, in other words, the place might be called Comares in honour of the people who worked there.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlhambra\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nRobert Irwin (2010).

        "wiki": "The Albaic\u00edn (Spanish pronunciation: [al\u03b2aj\u02c8\u03b8in]) or Albayz\u00edn (Arabic: \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0651\u0627\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0646\u0652\u200e) as it was known under Muslim rule, is a district of Granada, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. It retains the narrow winding streets of its Medieval Moorish past dating back to the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada. It was declared a World Heritage Site in 1984, along with the Alhambra.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area that later became the Albayz\u00edn was first populated by the Iberians, the original inhabitants of the Iberian peninsula, with dispersed Roman settlements later appearing nearby. Nothing is known of its history before the arrival of the Muslim       Berbers, so it is assumed that the city was abandoned after the fall of the Roman Empire until the founding of the Zirid kingdom in 1013, when its defensive walls were built. According to some linguists it owes its present name to the inhabitants of the city of Baeza, called \"Beatia\" by the Romans, who were banished after the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa and settled here outside the walls. Other linguists assert that the name derives from the Arabic al-bayy\u0101z\u012bn (pronounced al-bayy\u012bz\u012bn with the im\u0101la vowel-shift), meaning \"suburb of falconers\". However, the fact that in Andalusia there are many other neighborhoods with that name, including those in Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, Alhama de Granada, Salobre\u00f1a, and Antequera, among others, casts doubt on this thesis. A more likely hypothesis is that the name of Albaic\u00edn derives from Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0633\u064a\u0646 (al-b\u0101\u02beis\u012bn, 'the miserable' [plural]).The Albaic\u00edn, one of the oldest centers of Muslim culture in Granada, contains the Alhambra, the Realejo (which was the Jewish quarter), and the Arrabal de Bib-Arrambla, in the flat part of the city. Before the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula there were three small settlements in what is now the city of Granada and its surroundings:\n\nIliberis (Elvira), later called \"Albaic\u00edn\" and \"Alcazaba\"\nCastilia, near the present town of Atarfe\nGarnata, on the hill opposite the Alcazaba, which was more a neighborhood of Iliberis.However, current archaeological research indicates the Madinat Ilbira (Medina Elvira) was located in Atarfe when that city's population was moved to the Albayz\u00edn after the fall of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba in the 11th century. The inhabitants of Ilbira remained clients of the Berber Sinhaya and the Zirids until the capital of the Cora of Elvira was transferred to the Albayz\u00edn hill. The neighborhood had its greatest influence at the time of the Nasrids. The Albaic\u00edn maintains the urban layout of the Moorish period, with narrow streets winding in an intricate network that extends from the top at San Nicol\u00e1s and through Calle Elvira, both located in Plaza Nueva, by the course of the river Darro.\nThe traditional type of house is the carmen, consisting of a freestanding house surrounded by a high wall that separates it from the street and including a small orchard or garden. The channeling and distribution of drinking water through pipes laid from wells was characteristic of this district; about 28 of these have been found, of which most are preserved but not in use because the pipes were broken over time.\nIn December 1499, the Albaic\u00edn was the starting point of a rebellion throughout Granada, triggered by the forced conversion of the Muslim population to Christianity.In 1994, the Albaic\u00edn was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO as an extension of the monuments of the Alhambra and the Generalife.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\nIn the Albaic\u00edn there are numerous monuments from different periods, mainly the Nasrid period and the Renaissance:\n\nZiri wall (11th century), established along the Sacromonte and Albaic\u00edn.\nNew door or door of Weights, the Granadian people call and know it as arc of weights.\nFajalauza door in Cuesta de San Gregorio Alto, part of the wall.-\nAlhacaba Towers, part of the wall.\nMonaita door in Lona Lane, part of the wall.\nPuerta de Elvira, at the beginning of Calle Elvira, part of the wall.\nChurch of El Salvador, in the Cuesta del Chapiz.\nChurch of San Miguel Bajo, in the small square of San Miguel Bajo, with a Mudejar armor and a cistern of the 13th century.\nChurch of San Gregorio, at the beginning of the Cuesta de San Gregorio.\nChurch of San Cristobal and viewpoint with the same name, in Crta.

          "Great place to visit especially the Bio Dome. Wonderful for children, very interesting with lots to see and get hands on with. School parties will be there and maybe a bit noisy, but worth putting up with.",
          "The display of stuffed wild animals was cool, if not a bit bizzar. Reminded me of shopping at Cabela's at home. The birds of prey were cool, we just missed the show, but saw some outside their cages in the sun from not to far a distance. The other displays were mostly",
          "For all those wanting to spend a day learning in a fun and active way, this is the place to go. The park is huge and divided into so many sections. Go EARLY, or else you will not have enough time to see EVERYTHING!! It is exactly what the name says. A Science Park for both",
          "We loved the science park. The WOW exhibit was beautiful. I\u2019m not normally fond of taxidermy but the displays were artfully done in a way that showed how the animals would move. I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it. We allowed three hours for the whole park and it wasn\u2019t",
          "My favourite science museum is the one in Warsaw! All brill,whatever you touch is pure science,pure learning,no messing around with broken meaningless pieces...the one in Granada,on thd other hand,has meaningless,often broken pieces and installations....waste of time to a great",
          "Far too many highlights to mention. Must-sees are the Bioparc, the WOW Exhibition, the Music room, the Butterfly house. Not overpriced, good disabled access. Get there early to park in the small car park directly in front of the entrance. Make sure you hand in your car park",
          "In winter part is closed. but you still need at least 3 hours to get round parts. It's more a collection of several museums and not what I expected. Good for adults and especially children when fully open. Not seen anything like this elsewhere in Spain or UK",
          "Worth it for the BioDomo alone. Although fairly small, it packed a punch, and the kids loved it. You get given a one-hour slot in which to visit. The other exhibits, covering a range of topics such as the human body and music, were pretty good. Plenty of interactive things to",
          "A great Science Park just outside central Granada. Great interactive areas for both Kids and Adults. The BioDome is very good, with an amazing Aquarium, and various animals; some of which you can get very close too. The Butterfly farm is so interesting, we even watched a",
          "We spent over 5 hours here and still did not see everything. The biodome is very good, all the animals looked very well kept, and the display of stuffed animals is extraordinarily well done. There are hundreds of buttons to push and handles to turn. Not to be missed!",
          "Excellent mix of sciences. Biodome is a must if you visit. I enjoyed the music exhibition which is interactive, there is also a piano in the main circulation area that you can play. The views of the city and surrounding countryside are worth seeing from the lift accessed",
          "Who would have thought that there'll be a fantastic Science Park in Granada?! We went to the Biodomo and Museum. Our toddler loved the Biodomo. It's a very nicely maintained facility with lots of information. The museum is well worth a visit too. Lots of interesting exhibits and",
          "The Biodome is great,some animals roam free; Lemurs, Marmasets, Toucans and other birds.Care has been taken over habitat and they have successfully bred sloths this year. The outside, hands on , science and physics exhibits are well done and really interesting.There is also a",
          "Bit of a walk from the centre(25 mins), but for the entry price you get a lot. Loads to do and see, very nice, clean place. Kept us amused nearly all day. Staff all helpfull( especially the young guy in the Biodome). Nice cafe inside. Kids would love it( I did and I'm 64)",
          "What a find. We had a brilliant day out, both for the kids and the adults. A family tick was 40 euros, and worth every penny. There is so much to see and do here. We went into the BioDome first which contains a variety of animals and plants as well as a large aquarium with lots",
          "After surviving the tourism stampede and selfie-obsessed visitors of the Alhambra - discovering the Parque de las Ciencias was like a breath of fresh air. The scale and quality of the science exhibitions were very impressive. The welcome and advice from staff was wonderful. But",
          "I really enjoyed my day at the Science Park. I started with the Planetarium which was very interesting. Then it was off to the Bio Dome which is an aquarium and a tropical zoo with lots of wildlife. I then toured some of the exhibitions - the one about Music was outstanding.",
          "Located in an accessible, easy to find location. Well sign posted. Under \u20ac30 for two adults and a child. We went at the start of the Spanish school holidays. Activities from the moment you walked in. Demonstrations on various topics throughout the day. The bio centre and",
          "We went with our three kids, 14, 5 and 3. We all had a fantastic time. Price was very fair, around \u20ac50 for all of us including biodome. The planetarium was only in Spanish with no subtitles so we were advised against this when buying tickets as our Spanish definitely doesn't",
          "Wasn\u2019t expecting much. However, pleasantly surprised. The place has some excellent exhibits on animals. Moreover, there\u2019s a bio dome with birds, reptiles and a range of of large and little fish in tanks. The place is immaculately kept and has a cafe and restaurant on site. For a",
          "Even I found this so fun and interactive so I can\u2019t even imagine how it would be for kids. Really worth it.",
          "I really liked this science center. It has great permanent, as well as varying exhibits. It is creative and a bit unique from most science centers I have visited. It is interesting for both children and adults with lots of variety. I great find in Granada.",
          "A very interactive science museum. Pay extra for biodome entrance, the animals are in good condition and have enough space in the realistic environments. We visited on a Saturday in July but it wasn't overcrowded so we could experience all the displays. Planetarium is all in",
          "As a big fan of Science museums, I was completely disappointed. Place is a great idea, and there surely are some awesome things to see, but it's quite a mess and makes no sense, most of the time I had no clue where to go and in the end spent more time looking for a way out than",
          "Lots of interesting activities for children. There is a cafeteria with hot and cold food. It is a little bit of walk to the metro station or bus stops.",
          "some really good informative and imaginative displays yet still so many static confusing displays. the planetarium was better than the london disneyesque planetarium- well done. but just so so many written information boards that one loses the will to read/live after a while- it",
          "The science park has interactive collections and displays that are interesting for all ages. I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone with a few hours to spare in Granada, as you'd want to stay longer to see everything. The Bio Dome costs a little extra, but it's worth it",
          "I couldn\u2019t imagine after visiting Granada so many times that this Science park/museum/city was here. It\u2019s a must if you have children and worth it at every age",
          "Oh, my, what a lovely surprise!! Exceptional for anyone of any age. The school groups did our heads in a bit :)) BUT 1)they are easy to dodge and 2)it's just delightful seeing children have FUN with science and not be attached to a screen. They're just so damn loud ahah Don't",
          "This is a delight to visit, full of interesting things to do for all ages, highly recommended during a visit to Spain.",
          "Had a brilliant afternoon at the science park, we are not kids but that really does not matter!! We loved the bio domo and all the exhibitions. Really worth a visit and allow a bit more time than you think!!",
          "A lovely selection of science displays, from the workings of the human body (with some real exhibits) through the Biodome of water, land and air flora and fauna (where we saw an amazing collection of stick insects - didn't know there were so many different types), to the",
          "We had a lovely half day there,and included the bio domo which was fantastic they give you a time you can go in , if you had children you could stay all day the cafe was nice but maybe take a picnic",
          "The science Park is worth a look, it has something, I would say, for everyone, from the ' Journey through the human body' to the 'Planetarium' , which unfortunately only in spanish, but we were told this when we purchased our tickets. If over 65 take your passports to get the",
          "Lots has alreadt been said about the Science Centre. Great way to spend a few hours. Numerous interactive displays for all ages. The current Music exhibition is very good. The BioDome houses fish, reptiles, birds and mamals. Not very large but well laid out, easy to walk around",
          "Extraordinary birds demonstration. Large variety and very interesing demo and live class. Strongly recommend",
          "Although we\u2019re both in our 60s, my wife and I were like a couple of big kids during this visit! Simply, it is wonderful. So many things to see, experience and do. It made science really come alive. We wished school text books had been like this! We went for a couple of hours,",
          "It is to go relaxed and discover every corner. It is very highly recommended. It is difficult to enter because the tickets are finished,",
          "I went here with my parents and was amazed by how much this park has to offer! There is something for everyone and you can spend a lot of time there! Coming from Science Communication I think this place does a very good job at making science interesting and fascinating! I will",
          "Caught bus from Cathedral. Double check with driver as we had some difficulty finding the right one. Everyone told us a different no. I think the no11 ? Spent 5 hours but could have spent more. Some great exhibits, the taxidermy display was excellent and got to speak with the",
          "I went on a rainy day, but any day here is worthwhile. Must have spent 8 hours trying to see it all. So many neat exhibits. I really like the bio dome area. There are unique animals to see up close and several bugs. Really amazing and great variety. The taxidermy was the",
          "What to do with a hyperactive seven year old visiting Spain? We spent six hours in the science park and didn\u2019t see it all. Our young nephew was totally enthralled but I suspect the adults enjoyed it even more. Really great day out at reasonable price. We will definitely return",
          "Can you believe it but we were unable to find a single car to hire in the whole of Granada today! Not one. So whilst the Alpujarras had to be delayed, we ended up going to this science park instead. Where did 4 hours go? It\u2019s just brilliant. From floating stones, to Einstein",
          "If you are in Granada and want to learn more about all sciences, the Parque de las Ciencias is a must. The main building, which has been standing for nearly two decades, still has very good and many zones where one can find out about optics, dynamics and several other scientific",
          "Worth a visit even if some of the exhibitions are a little dated. Some of the experiments are fun and interesting. Went up the tower, superb views of the city from up there. The butterfly house was fun to visit. Avoid the coffee shop. Ate a sandwich which was very tasteless,",
          "A great place to go visit to get out of the sun for a few hours, a mixture of science, history and live animals. Pay the extra to visit the biodome.",
          "A great place to relive your school day science experiments, all the hands on experiments takes ages to go through. Pay extra and visit the biosphere, well worth the visit and the staff are very friendly and willing to answer any questions about the animals. The planetarium",
          "The BioDome is worth paying the extra to go in. Highlight seeing the Sloth so close up. Some of the other attractions like the observation tower have odd opening times so we could not see them. The science exhibits look a bit dated in parts. Not seen that model Applemac",
          "Vast museum. In 6 hours we saw maybe half of it. The human biology and bio done were both exceptional exhibits. Absolutely worth a visit if you have any interest in science. Also makes a nice change after a few days of Renaissance history!",
          "We made the 2 hour drive, and it was well worth the distance. \u20ac35 for a family of 4 ( 2 adults, 2 children ages 11 and 2) this included the bio dome and planetarium. The planetarium talk is only available in spainish. Though, the lovely guide did he\u2019s best to explain in",
          "So glad we decided to put aside some time to visit this Science Centre. What a great family attraction. We have an 11 year old daughter and she really enjoyed trying all the interactive exhibits and visiting the biodome. We also had lunch in the cafe which was cheap and",
          "We spent most of a day at this science museum that includes many different activities all worth the visit. Be sure to include a visit to the Biodomo where you will see live animals including many different fish from around the world, lemurs, birds and insects. The museum is in",
          "Tons of stuff to see and do, very reasonably priced. families can easily spend a whole day and love every minute. I particularly loved the Bio Domes.",
          "So much to see! We escaped the 42 degree heat for a couple of hours and failed to scratch the surface. It is rare to find something a 10 year old boy and 15 year old girl can enjoy together! You could easily spend a day at the eclectic attraction. We loved the butterfly house",
          "The Biodome is not enormous, but certainly worth visiting. The aquaria are professionally presented while the terrestrial displays are very attractive. The Amazon area is especially impressive - Spangled Cotinga are a delight.",
          "We had a great day here. OUr kids (8 and 12) were there 6 house and felt like we didnt have enough time. The biodome. the outdoor play area, the butterfly garden, the building itself: it was great. I recommend it! (Take the city bus, it is a long way from city center)",
          "The human body exhibition was very interesting and covered a range of topics. The Bio Domo is an experience not to be missed - especially the toucans and lemurs. The wow exhibition was well crafted and informative on animal movement and hunting techniques.",
          "We visited on a Sunday as we didn\u2019t think it would need a long day we were wrong it was really interesting and nearly all in English and Spanish. The only let down was the planetarium which had no English but it was only a euro entry extra for this. The bio dome area was great",
          "Had a great 5 hours at the museum with our 12 year old. Did not buy tickets to the biodome and still was lot to see and do. Some were closed like the planetarium. Would recommed to anyone!",
          "Such a great experience for the whole family. We only had half a day and oilfield have spent a whole day!!",
          "We spent half a day here. Was surely better than expectations.The viewing gallery however was surprisingly closed for 3 hrs between 2-5 . Maybe the concerned staff were enjoying a spanish siesta.",
          "We were looking for a rainy day activity and found a description of the Parque de las Ciencias online. The biodome was definitely the highlight. Don\u2019t spend too much time looking at fish and reptiles. You've only got an hour, so save time for the upper level. Once you get to",
          "This is a large complex and the signage isn't great so it's worth looking at the maps dotted around to make sure you don't miss anything. There are exhibits both inside and outside to explore. It gives you a real 'hands on' experience. Many of the exhibits are interactive and",
          "We only had 2.5 hours and it was not nearly enough time. I cannot understand why this is not The Number One Thing to do in Granada. It is one of the best museums we have ever visited. There is an amazing amount of quality displays, most of which are hands on and interactive.",
          "As the title suggests, a visit to a place like this is not always something a family will choose, especially when time is limited and there are more historical places to visit. However, you won\u2019t be disappointed, and your kids including teenagers will certainly be entertained -",
          "Took the kids (9 and 1) here on a rainy day in April. We all had a fantastic time with the exhibitions, interactive elements and the knowledgeable staff. We have been to a few science parks/centres in the UK before but this one is far better. Strongly recommend.",
          "We stayed at a hotel not very far from this science park and musuem and decided to check it out after seeing the usual attractions in Granada. And we were very glad that we did. The grounds of the museum are quite large and contain a number attractions but the primary one is",
          "This was our 2nd attempt to visit the Science Park, we had originally tried on dia andalusia when there were queue around the block (we hadn\u2019t realised it was free to enter on that day) so had lots of anticipation building but and we have to say we were not disappointed! So",
          "I have to say that I had high expectations of this place which were sadly disappointed. I was expecting so much more than it delivered. In many ways this can be seen as Spain's answer to the Science Museum in London. Although some of the exhibitions were great and very thought",
          "What an amazing park is this. It was very interesting andbig. But the best thing was the biodomo this is a botanical garden and mini zoo in one. Sooo beautiful. Entrance was 11 euro.",
          "When I visit Science Park i saw The Human Body exhibition, Biodome and robotics esponats for adults and childrens. For my the best was oryginal drawing od dendrite Ramona y Cayal",
          "A lot to see and do First of all most things are written in English and Spanish so if you don't understand spanish don't let this stop you coming. However the bird show and planetarium is all in Spanish Everywhere has there good and bad points... this place is no different.",
          "For visiting you need about 3 hours, if you want to see all exhibitions and try most of them. I will offer you to visit the viewing point too - you can see all Granada.",
          "Had a great time....plenty to do and fun for adults too!! Lots of fun educational things to do and learn about \ud83d\udc4c Take a packed lunch & drinks as vending machines cost a lot here \ud83d\udcb0 We liked the fact there were inside and outside activities...kids need to be about 5 years old to",
          "Really great museum. The Biodome has a good variety of animals you can get very close to. The robot exhibit was well done. And there is an exhibit on animal biomechanics done with fabulous taxidermy. We spent 3 hours there as a diversion from churches and historic sites.",
          "So much to see here and you learn a lot. Takes at least 3-4 hrs (Some may spend whole day here) to get around and only 7 euros. Can't get nothing like this for double that price here.",
          "Granada is not just Alhambra and tapas. El Parque de las Ciencias has been an important place over the last 15 years for Granada. I\u2019ve visited few times, last one yesterday and was very good. Im not sure how no Spanish visitors will make to understand everything because I",
          "Very good for small kids, the Biodome and Butterfly park are small but well taken care of. The Wow exposition is impressive, even for adults . Good option to spend a few hours with the kids. They close at15h, so make sure you arrive early if you want to visita the whole park",
          "We\u2019ve been to the science park in Valencia and were interested to see how this compared. Some elements were very modern and engaging, whereas others were quite outdated and old fashioned. The signage (both inside and outside) is poor, we struggled to find the entrance on foot",
          "The Science Park is a must visit if you have young children. There is so much to do that you can easily spend a good part of the day. General entry to the park gives you access to everything other than the Bio Dome and Planetarium, both of which cost extra. There are a number",
          "Love the visit! It was a great day out especially on a Sunday where almost everything closes in Granada. We purchase the Biodome and museum tickets combo. Do note the park opening time is from 10-3pm on Sunday! This is a place to be visited for all ages!",
          "If you are a Science person, you don't want to miss this park. With a lot of exhibitions going on, special rooms and yard games, this is a nice way to spend a morning !",
          "We went to the Science Museum as it was a rainy day - and loved it! Fab modern buildings with easy underground parking. Very interactive and plenty of staff on hand to help at all levels. Lots of space, no crowding, light and airy and cool. Great modern displays and plenty of",
          "Great few hours at the science park. Nice walk to the park to see other parts of the city. Nicely laid out with various sections and it was nice to wander around all the exhibits. Some you can interact with and many with English descriptions. The BioDome is a must see and great",
          "What a great place for adults and children alike. Full of interactive hands on exhibits. Good for rainy or sunny day we enjoyed the bird of prey show ven though we did not understand what was said. Exhibits in Spanish and English. Tip take your own food there's was not good.",
          "I took my girl of 11 and boy of 9 and they loved it. We had a general admission ticket, with bio zone, which was well worth it. There are lots of things to interact with, both indoors and out. The restaurant was nothing special, but okay. The robot and body exhibitions were",
          "It's great. Especially the Bio Domo, that's a must. The guards don't like it when you pet the lemurs (so don't do it), but the lemurs don't seem to mind at all :) Also the current Wow exhibition was very well done and the Robots are also great - and there's an actual robot that",
          "Me and my children had an excellent time here. If you come to Granada, put some time aside to come here. Everyone enjoyed it. The staff were really helpfull and friendly.",
          "We had this as a feature on our Granada card and I'm not sure we would have known to go here otherwise. There were some extra features we paid for like the planetarium (all in Spanish, and my linguistic skills were not good enough to follow. However, the chairs were really",
          "Went here hoping to experience a natural environment for animals and birds. This is a science center that has a focus on teaching people about the environment and all aspects of natural science. With that understanding I recommend it for those whose interest is more suited to",

          "I went to this park with my parents - as I'm twenty, we can consider between adults - and we all spent a very great afternoon there! It's a museum, but there's a lot to do in there! You can try everything, there's a room about human body, one about prevention, also one of robots",
          "As adults looking for something to do in the day, we really enjoyed the science museum. For the most part, the museum is aimed at children, and has lots of interactive educational elements. We however REALLY enjoyed the animal section, while the others laughed at me in the",
          "We had a fantastic half day at the Parque de las Ciencias with our 3 and 5yr old kids. The biodome in particular was fantastic - the kids loved the aquarium and walking through the tropical enclosures with tropical birds coming over to touching distance. They also enjoyed the",
          "We don't normally do science parks but visiting this one was a good decision. There was a good variety of activities which are interesting and also educational at the same time. We included a visit to the Bio dome which is a small extra cost but well worth it. You need at least",

          "This was a very interesting place with lots to see and not too expensive to get in - just \u20ac8 if you just want to look at the main part then you can choose to add on the planetarium and /or biodome",
          "Robot exhibit not that interesting. Wildlife exhibition quite interesting. Lots space that could be filled with a lot more. However we didn't have time to visit the planetarium or butterflies exhibit. Restaurant good.",

          "The decision to visit the Science Park was well rewarded. It is a place which is very big with different expositions and scientific games to indulge with. I liked the exposition of BioDomo a lot. It includes different ecosystems (Asia, Madagascar, Amazon) along with the animals",
          "The Science Park in Granada is an array of really modern buildings that covers several acres in a coordinated plan by one of Spain's most famous architects. It stands in marked contrast to the historically rich architecture of the rest of the city. Well worth a visit!",
          "This park took it to the next level! Science immersion in the perfect way, worth a visit. Though some theaters were displayed only in Spanish, I wished they had at lead English translation.",
          "Even only visiting the museum and biodome but the experience is great..! Pay attention to visiting hours of the exhibits..",

          "Planned the visit well in advance. Used LAC bus to get close and then walked along the river. Entrance to the park is the same as the Biodome on the south side of the complex. Highlight of the visit was the lift to the top of the tower and the views from the tower. We",

          "Like a science theme park with many facets of science different exhibitions displays birds interactive learning similar to the science museum London",

          "What a fabulously entertaining way to spend a few hours! The complex is on the edge of the City and easily accessible for buses and cars. Good quality displays and the recent addition of the Bio-dome was inspiring. Good value too",
          "The Science Park is a 15-20min walk from the centre of town. We strolled alongside the Genil river and it's very easy to find from there. There's a general entrance fee, which provides a timed visit to the Bio Dome that you need to stick to. Apart from that, you're free to",
          "Well done to appeal to all . There is a raptor section and show well worth the time and effort. Heavily attended and all in Spanish. This does not detract from the bird show. The tower is also worth the ride up unless heights frightens you. Fantastic views. Many of the displays",
          "Wildlife of hundreds animals and videos(BBC & National Geographic) perfect ecosystems of tropical countries, brain storming science experiments, Robots and Humans, how to make wines and olive oils and the lists keep going. Your kids will learn enjoying without knowing the time",
          "Took my 2 kids (4,7) here for the day - they both loved it. Tons to see, animals, interactive science / engineering type exhibits. We paid for the bio dome - it was worth the \u20ac6 or so for sure, decent sized aquarium, monkeys, alligators etc. Went up the observation tower, huge",
          "This is an interesting place with lots to see especially if you have a scientific mind. A change from the usual tourist places in Granada if ou wanted one.",
          "We spent a whole day at this attraction, it was interesting, varied and reasonably priced. I would recommend this attraction.",
          "Interesting interactive science park. A very large park with many different sections and exhibitions. Perfect for children and school-educational visits. Not enough thing directed to adults, for my taste.",
          "This is a greta place to spend time learning about the world and everything in it. Terrific for adults and kids alike. WE especially enjoyed the BioDomo. The Park is extensive and you could easily spend a week there.",
          "I came here with my boyfriend and we really enjoyed walking around and visiting the exhibits. The WOW exhibit is a must see, that was our favourite part. We did\u00b4nt see the space exhibit due to lack of time but great museum overall.",
          "This place is awesome - so much to explore! You'll need at least a day to really see everything. The complex is very impressive in itself, and between the butterfly house, the planetarium, the human body exhibits and the taxidermy, you'll never get bored.",
          "Our children ages 12, 8 and 4 enjoyed spending the day at the Science Park. We were there for 5 hours and did not get to see everything. This is a great quality museum that kept us all entertained with so much to discover. Even the food was good. Highly recommend if you are",
          "For a family that makes a point of visiting the local zoo, aquarium and science museum in each trip, this park was the best we have seen. Most important to the experience are the staff in each room who know the subject to the detail and are able to explain it the most",
          "If you're visiting Granada with kids and they're fed-up of history and cultural heritage, just take them to the science park. They'll have fun with its interactive activities and exhibitions specially designed for kids, the animals, etc.",

          "This is a nice leisure option for a day trip and an educational one for children, with dining options as well. However, keep in mind that this is Spain and even though this may be open during siesta hours, a lot of exhibits will likely be closed. We didn't get to see much of",

          "Being a huge science museum fan, it was a pleasure to visit the Parque de las Ciencias, Granada. The famous ants on the observation tower were something I had to see. I only had one day in Granada, so the visit was short to the park, and I elected to be there at opening time.",
          "I had been here before a few years ago, but was well worth a second visit as they had new exhibitions and areas to see. Watch out for the timings though, by the time we had had a good look around and some refreshments by the cooling water feature, the Bio Domo which we had paid",
          "One of the strangest science museums I have ever experienced. Written information was geared towards adults with master's level educations. Hands-on displays gave small kids something to play with while providing no education. Many displays were broken and some exhibits were",

          "After what we saw in Valencia, we didn't expect quite the same, but we did enjoy it almost as much. Compared to the Ciudad de las ciencias of Valencia, Granda's science park is smaller yet ti still offers plenty for the youngsters to enjoy. The Maze, the giant chess board, the",
          "Lots to see and do in this location. Probably need a couple of days to get the full benefit but even a short visit is enjoyable. Admission very reasonable..",
          "We have been to the Science Park many times, but this year wanted to see the new Biodome. It is VERY impressive. It has been very carefully set out, and all the exhibits are of the highest quality, starting with an aquarium experience right through to the ring-tailed lemurs",
          "We have had a wonderful day here, there is so much to see and do we virtually ran out of time. Staff very helpful. English and Spanish spoken. Pay the extra to go into the Bio Dome, an awesome experience. Such a good value day for money.",
          "We took our 9 year old gran\u010fson here in August, it is a fantastic place for both young and old. Even before you go through into the park itself there are lots of hands on exhibits to interest all. We decided as there was so much to see and do we left the biodome and planaterium",
          "This science park is so large that its campus has several different buildings. Each exhibit is very well done in both Spanish and English. If you have only two hours to explore, take in a few of the exhibits. If you have more time to spend, take in the museum, the planetarium",
          "Spent a day here with the wife and kids aged 9, 7, 5 and a 6 month old baby. Found the review comparing it with the Natural History Museum a little bizarre, comparing apples and oranges in my opinion. I've been to the NHM, as well as Glasgow Science Centre. GSC is about double",

          "I went here with my boyfriend as we got entry to it with Alhambra Tourist Card that we payed for so we wanted to make the most of our money. Some areas are very good and interesting (journey through the human body, animal skeletons) but other areas only have interactive parts",
          "You would need a whole day to explore this park. We were there on a Sunday from the time it opened (10 am) to the last minute (3 pm), and we did not have a chance to see everything it offers. The observatory talks are very nice! There are a lot of activities illustrative basic",
          "Spent a whole Sunday at the Science Park - so many different attractions! As well as many hands-on activities (perfect for both children and adults), there were many other parts to the Park including a butterfly house, a bird display and a stuffed animal exhibition. My favourite",
          "We spent over 4 hours in the science park. The kids (9&12) had a ball and could have spent longer. Really well laid out, very spacious and lots of interactive exhibits. Plenty for older kids and adults as well. Strongly recommend it as an alternative day out- especially on a",

          "The science park always has great exhibits. I highly recommend seeing what they have on display. It is a great place to take kids.",
          "Excellent activities for kids (both you fog and teenagers). Plenty for adults and the exhibit on the history of Andalusia/al andaluz is world class in its conception and execution.",
          "This is an amazing place. We were looking for something to do with 3 young children to get them out of the midday sun for a couple of hours, we came to the Science Park without any expectations but ended up staying here all day - it's an excellent day out for all ages - from",
          "So much to do! This museum has a mix of things to see and things to do, with a fantastic range of topics. The static rooms are educational and open, and the temporary exhibitions/themes are always interesting. They are focussing more on having things explained in English, an",
          "My friend and I got the Granada card (definitely worth the money) and the science park was included with free admission. We decided to give it a shot. The bus system is easy enough but tell the driver which stop you're looking for and he will help you get off the bus - if no one",
          "I would have liked to visit this, but although advertised as open on Sundays it was closed without any explanation. Very disappointing.",
          "My kids loved their afternoon at the science park! lots of fun activities even if they did not understand Spanish (we did so less of an issue). Very nicely done, would love to have a pack/museum like this in my town/area!! Great for all ages, mine from ages 4 to 11.",
          "We spent the afternoon here as a change for our 11 year old from looking at historical sites. He really enjoyed it especially some of the interactive sections. We would have liked more of the museum to be hands on. Do check the handouts for various opening and closing times as",
          "My friend and I decided to visit just because we had time. It was very quiet when we went - maybe because Granada has so much more of offer. Still it was pretty fun and they have good facilities. Their planetarium was the best thing about it but probably wouldnt go again.",
          "We've been to a lot of science museums and this was one of our favorites! We were there 4 or 5 hours until closing, and we didn't come close to seeing everything. It was a great break from all the historical sites. There was a fabulous traveling exhibit about a prehistoric",
          "Frankly I was not amazed at all. It's a massive building but not properly optimised to host scientific things. The expositions were quite poor, but at least they made an effort to add short translations in English. Outside the main building there is a butterfly garden, with 10",
          "The exhibits and games are interesting. The only issue is much of the park takes a siesta 3-5, so that's a good time to avoid. Don't miss the butterfly building. In addition to large and unskittish butterflies, it has unusually colored turtles. A warning for the squeamish or",
          "Our hotel was a 13 minute walk from here so we popped in to take a look. Exhibitions were very good with lots of interactive displays which my daughter age 12, my husband and I and the grandparents thoroughly enjoyed! We went in Sunday open 19am till 3pm and there was still more",
          "Visited the science park as the weather was a bit cold and overcast. Was expecting to be charged quite a lot, as different areas had their own individual cost. Was pleased to pay just one price, 7\u20ac each was excellent value for the amount of time we were there. Particularly",
          "When I went there was an impressive mummy collection from all over the world. I must admit it was freakish. There was also an exhibit on \u00d6tzi and Neanderthals - the most in-depth I've ever seen. The gift shop has decent prices and a lot of neat curiosities that make good gifts",

          "I really liked the museum. U need several hours to visit it properly. The 3 first hours of the parking cost u 1 euro, but u will have to pay more. U can have food inside in a small caf\u00e9, there are menu of the day, not really good, but it\u00b4s just fine.Some attractions are closed",
          "Excellent expositions, better reserve half of the day to visit this place. There is a huge variety of topics and much to be learnt. Also quite close to other interesting places, though it is a bit tricky getting to there by bus on the first time.",
          "Definitely a fun and interactive museum. I really enjoyed the mummy exhibit. It was fascinating with so much to see. There is a lot of hands on activities which I enjoyed. The museum is catered towards children but is very interesting for adults alike and very informative. I",
          "Probably the best science museum I've been at in Spain. Staff are well Educated, friendly, and helpful. A lot of activities for children as well. A must see if you visit Granada.",
          "We payed 6.5 euros and it was worth every cent. There more than 6 activities and exibitions. We passed almost all the day and very exciting and fun. I can suggest especially if you have kids. Lots of activities for kids.",
          "Situated 2 kilometres southwest from the pedestrianized centre of Granada, the science park offers a break from the high culture offerings that Granada has in abundance. It also provides an attraction for children (and adults) that is not a theme park. The exhibits are",
          "I've been several times to see different exhibitions here and am never bored by the place. The latest exhibition I saw was 'Momias'. A very well presented and thought out display of mummies from around the world. The park is popular with school parties and families as there are",
          "Probably the third thing to do after Alhambra and Cathedral of Granada , very good for family visits , kids will enjoy it Take the blue bus LAC (blue buss ) from Gran via to Palacio Del Congreso and then from the same location a bit below on the same street another buss ( red",
          "Some of the displays were excellent - particularly in Foucalts pendulum - the hands on stuff for children is excellent. We also went to the \u00b4add on\u00b4 trip to the planetarium which was geared around children and was fascinating. Included a trip inside a blown up milky way system",
          "Very cool science experience. Don't miss the interactive pavilion at the back. The gardens are stunning and the science is everywhere. My teenagers found many of the activities aimed at youngsters. If you have young kids, be prepared to spend the whole day and take a taxi from",
          "A full day is well spent here with plenty of hands on opportunities and plenty for children to do. Indoor and outdoor spaces and an adequate cafe. Special exhibitions at different times of the year mean the park always has something new to offer.",
          "A huge range of science exhibits presented in a fun way for all. If one exhibit fails to excite and interest, there are so many others that will.........planetarium, butterflies, preserved animals etc.",
          "We LOVED the science park, it has so much to see and do and kept our kids entertained, they didn't want to leave and that is impressive for 12, 9 and 8 year olds who are normally glued to computer games.",
          "Quite good but no info in English and the place is a maze... when you find all the seperate elements it is ding dangly interesting. A lot of the exhibits are temporary - the nutrition one was great. Cheap cafe there as well!!",
          "What a great surprise to find a science museum of this calibre in Granada. This is the third my family has been to in the last few months. London was good, Lisboa was great, Granada fantastic! So much of interest to capture the kids and adults alike. The kids were totally",
          "We were traveling with 4 grown kids who are knowlagable in science. We spent 3 hours in the museum and had fun, it is a good museum, but more suited to younger kids and teenagers.",
          "Spent yesterday visiting the Parque de las Ciencias. The entrance fee was only \u20ac5.50! This is a vast area with several pavilions with different themes. There is something here for everyone, young and old. Even if you're not a scientist, you'll genuinely be amazed at the",
          "This really is some Science Museum. Forget dull, boring presentations. This place is full of innovative ideas with plenty of opportunities to interact, making it both informative and fun.",
          "My friend and I (we are both mid 20s) visited this place when we were in Granada and had an absolute blast! Lots of fun interactive displays, the birds of prey show was cool to watch (not in English though), the butterflies in the butterfly house were beautiful and the tower",
          "For those who may be visiting Granada in the future, a wonderful museum is available. I enjoyed the visit and felt it worthy of bringing the place to your attention.",
          "lots of practical activities for children, and a fun half a day out. The butterfly house is lovely and we really enjoyed the birds of pray display (note: this may not be a permanent display). Very little in the way of English explanations, but fun never the less.",
          "We went there on foot. Actually it is very easy reachable from city centre. You can't miss it. Complex is huge with 6/7 pavilions, each one has its own thematic. It is good for families with kids because there are lot of interactive stuff to play and learn about human body,",
          "This place is much bigger and more complex than you originally think with a really engaging variety of exhibitions both permanent and temporary. The section on the human body is fascinating with lots of interactive models to play with. The current temporary exhibition, which is",
          "We had planned for some months ahead to visit Granada whilst in Spain however, on the day we were due to visit I felt I needed something to keep my teenage daughter happy....rather than just sightseeing. When I checked on the internet I was so surprised to find a science",
          "We took the tourist bus to the science park as it was included in our Granada Card. This is much more than just a science museum and much more interactive. There are lots of demonstrations and workshops each day - we saw a puppet workshop which was excellent, a demonstration",
          "The best day out in Granada. We had our teenage daughter with us and we all thoroughly enjoyed the science park, the red sightseeing bus stops right outside which was very handy. Great for all ages, the experiments in all areas are fun and keep the interest flowing all the way",
          "Very nice afternoon we stayed more than 4 hours ! The butterfly showcase is magical as well as the bird show Very nice experience pretty much everything is translated into English but no other languages ! Planetarium is 1\u20ac extra on the normal ticket not really a must kind of",
          "We thought we'd take a few hours away from typical sights to give the kids (10 and 12) a change of pace. We ended up spending the whole afternoon here, it's a lovely science centre, lots to do, kids had a great time. Worth the visit.",
          "Was pleasantly surprised with the amount there was to see and do at the science park, and the size of it considering how small Granada is in regards to other cities I have visited. There was so much to do and see, we didn't get merely enough time to do it all! There was a",
          "We went to this on the tour bus which stopped outside. Free entry as we had a GRANADA CARD and so interesting. Everything is explained in English and Spanish and is well displayed, better than a lot of our museums. If you want to see the birds of prey show you need to check",
          "This excellent science park was one of our favourite experiences in Granada. We particularly enjoyed: - the physics room - the interactive ball park - the bird of prey show - the human body room (particularly the exhibit brain vs brain) All the exhibits are in dual",
          "did this on a rainy afternoon before seeing the alhambra,. its so worth while! cheap entry, and my 7 year old son and i had close to 2 hours to race through it... it can be done! not many people, fab installations, unusual expos, and so darn interesting!! for all ages!! it can",
          "My 21 year old daughter who,was studying abroad suggested this attraction as she wanted her 11 year old brother to have a fun day. He did, but so,did everyone else in the party. There are indoor and outdoor activities, and although we expected to stay just a couple,hours we",
          "I knew we would be jetlagged and fighting sleep when we reached Granada from the U.S., so I wanted to start our trip somewhere that would easily engage the whole family and keep us moving. Parque de las Ciencias was the perfect place to start! It was a gorgeous day out, so we",
          "We have been to a number of science themed attractions in Europe and this is by far the best. Everything from the quality of the exhibits to the huge variety of things to see and do, to the helpful friendly staff make this place a must see. Every exhibit has an English",
          "This attraction was one of the best places I visited in Granada. It is a lovely, modern building packed with interesting things to see and do. It is not expensive to enter and the red tour bus stops right outside. Lots of interactive displays and interesting sections to visit.",
          "Lots of interesting hands on interactives for young and old to enjoy. Great temporary exhibitions and a very nice cafe",
          "Lots of interactive displays, great fun for all ages. My 9 year old son thoroughly enjoyed it! It's a large park with lots to see, and unfortunately we didn't get to see everything, but what we did see was excellent. Something for everyone.",
          "Even though this was aimed at children it still held our attention, one of us being 91. A day was not long enough to view it all.",
          "First of all, our 12 year son is heavily into science. We (the parents) are artists. Enough Said. I was dreading a whole day in the science park. BUT WAIt TIL YOU GET THERE!!!! It is fantastic beyond your wildest dreams - an amazing array of different zones to cater to all areas",
          "The Science Park is very good to see because there are many interesting exhibits there. There are several permanent exhibits that are very good. Children will enjoy seeing this museum.",
          "We took our children here last summer and it was a fantastic day out. There were so many things to see and do that we regreted getting there later than planned (gps disasters when trying to find parking). The butterflies were fantastic - my daughter really enjoyed the moment",
          "Went to see the butterfly exhibit and there were none. Saw four butterflies, One turtle and some Koi. End of story.",
          "I think that more people really should check out the science park. Although it is not what most people think of when they think about 'museums', it is a fabulous place to go and spend the day. I guarantee that you will learn something.",
          "The science park in Granada capital is well worth a visit, modern installations, outside and inside areas, very interesting exhibits some of them, 'hands on', relating to all branches of science and a planetarium. a very good day out.",
          "A vast open space from which exhibition areas lead off. There are lots of helpful staff around. We were in a hurry and using the tourist card, so we only visited the human body. There was so much more to see, we could have spent a whole day there.",
          "We went to the park with our 2yr old son, and we had a great time! we spent almost all the day there, seeing the different attractions. the puppets show and the tower are the things we liked the most.",
          "There is something for everyone here, brilliant interactive exhibits, outdoor space to run and play with great games and puzzles everywhere you turn, a rainforest with butterflies and turtles. In the 4 hours we were there, we barely covered half of the park as we were so",
          "Took my great nephews,niece,sister n hubby for day out at the science park in Granada.The sun was shining,views from the tower of the city were amazing,all in all a great day out for everyone of all ages and would highly recommend!",
          "Having encountered an unusually overcast day in Granada, we decided to take our three year old to the Science park. The site is pretty big, and took us the best part of a day to get round it all. The park is divided into several areas over a wide space, so comfortable shoes",
          "Good price for this attraction. Very well set up, nice staff and gift shops. The butterfly house was awesome, but Josefina and Angela and their hawk, owl, and falcon at the birds of prey exhibit were really special. The hawk flying nearby in the photo actually grazed me passing",
          "Found it difficult to tear the kids away from this place - so much to see and do. You walk away feeling you'd only seen half of it! Such a shame that opening hours on public holidays are shorter than other days!",
          "This is a wonderful hands-on museum that my children (ages 13 and 6) both enjoyed. An inexpensive treat in a lovely city.",
          "The family really enjoyed this park, especially the room that dealt with the Brain. Some great puzzles dotted around the place to get the brain cells working. Other highlights include the sections on the body and the speaking robot.",
          "On a hot Sunday, we visited the Parque de las Ciencias in Granada. It is easy to find, and parking was extremely easy in a underground car park, at a fee of 1.00 euro for 3 hours. The displays and explanations were comprehensive, if a little 'worthy', but also, more",
          "We had 2 kids with us, 10 and 12. They loved it, we did too. Have been in lots of science museums and this is one of the best. NB lots of interactive stuff. My wife is a retired nurse and even she learned new stuff in the body zone. All this for 6.5\u20ac !!!",
          "The science park is good value for money as there is plenty to see and keep you busy all day. I particularly liked the butterfly house there and the bird of prey show. The tower provides excellent all round views but be sure you don't miss out on it because it is closed for",
          "My husband and I love science museums, and were excited to try out an entire science park, but were sadly disappointed by the lack of interactive materials. It might have been a better experience if it hadn't been 100 degrees outside, but even the inside exhibits were less than",
          "It is a very funny and interesting way to understand science, visiting the different sections of the park like \u00a8The human body\u00a8, \u00a8Butterflies greenhouse\u00b4, the Observatorium, Einstein area etc. I would recommend it espacially to families and young students.",
          "a good day out for the family, great staff....but bring your own food as the reviews say. Do take the time to plan in advance.",
          "My sisters and their children visited the science park whilst my father and I went to Cordoba and although I didn't visit it, I sure wish I had! All of the kids and adults who went, without exception, could not fault this museum in any way and had lots of really positive",
          "Well laid out, full of interesting stuff a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon's entertainment, beware of the birds of prey display though. The handler talks for 45 min and the birds fly for 5...I think it's aimed at school parties.",
          "Great fun, easy access from car park situated underneath which cost practically nothing when visiting the science park. The park is way to big to visit everything in one day with young children but great fun to pick and choose the areas that interest you. Great outdoor learning",
          "We all loved it here, esp kids, aged 3 and 6. They liked it so much we went again 6 months later.Kids favourite thing was the huge marble run. Only let down was my son was to young to go into the planeteruim. Value for money is excellant, you will need a whole day for this.",
          "I visited this expo/park on a whim as there was an expo going on to celebrate the park's 18th anniversary. It is a nice little centre with good examples of scientific principles and applications. Well worth the effort.",
          "an impressive science museum. I only had enough time to see the historic sciences from the moorish rule, and the human body pavilion and they were both awesome. This is also a good place to pick up the granada card, which includes entry to this science park, the alhambra and",
          "A very nice museum with a lot of activities and many interesting exhibitions. I didn't enjoy all of them the same, but most of them were really innovative and intriguing. I specially recommend it to families with small children, although it's not addressed only to them.",
          "So much to see and do. Well organized and interactive. Highly recommended for all ages. A variety of exhibits that will interest young and older visitors.",
          "This is great for people of all ages. It would be great for keeping the kids happy but there's also plenty for the adults too!",
          "I wandered into the science park not expecting to spend a lot of time there. I was wrong and spent the entire day there. The staff are all friendly and very informative. Should have taken a picnic as the food in the caf\u00e9 wasn\u2019t up to much. The butterfly house was very good",
          "As a non Spanish speaking family, this did not hinder what was a full on interactive day. It was a shame that on a Sunday it closed at 3pm as we still had areas to explore, even after arriving at 10am. I would fully recommend this to any family. A great day out.",
          "Probably would have not gone if the ticket for the Alambra included some other sites. Was very interesting, they had a short demonstration of Birds of Prey flying around.",
          "Stayed quite near by so just popped in for a look, and were not disappointed. the layout is a little confusing at first but once you have worked it out its fine. The puppet exhibition was excellent and lots of interactive thing to play with! we didn't have a lot of time so it",
          "We spent half a day exploring this massive museum with a family including kids as young as 8 and grand parents. Everyone pays to attend and you get access to pretty much everything with the standard ticket (including free parking on site). There are a huge number of exhibits",
          "The science Park was great fun, so many different areas to explore. Our daughter (6yrs) was so excited and didn't know where to look first. Hands on activities and fun learning experience for all the family. Could have spent hours and hours there. We went on a Sunday, so was a",
          "We heard a lot about this museum. We stayed at the NH Victoria at Puerta Real and decided to walk all the way. According to our iPad, it is about 1.8km! The directions were simple and it took about twenty minutes to find our way. The museum is huge! There are plenty of",
          "This is definitly a must see in Granada. Fantastic fun for the whole family. Spend 5-6 hours. We only had 2 1/2 hours than that was not enough.",
          "I totally liked my visit! I planned to spend 2-3 hours there but it ended up to 9! The exhibitions and collections are amazing, and I especially liked the way they're presented: most of them you can touch/smell/hear/play. There're two cafes in the museum, but I wouldn't",
          "The museum has a lot of temporary exhibit space along with their permanent installations. When I was there I saw the Puppets exhibit which was far more impressive and enjoyable than I would have thought puppets could be. There was also an exhibit on the human body and other",
          "We had a really fascination day out here. Made our brains think a little differently and very much had a great day playing. Great value for money.",
          "Our grandchildren loved it at the Science Museum in Granada - we were lucky enough to see the T Rex exhibition where the huge animated monsters captivated their imagination. Lots of interesting things to see and interactive things for the kids to take part in. Great day out.",
          "We went here while visiting family in Granada and took our niece and nephew.. they absolutely LOVED it! Lots to do and see! Make sure you have plenty of time to look around- with smaller kids they may get a bit bored or tired out so take the strollers! Very neat place to visit!",
          "I'm conscious that many of the posts here from people with kids are very positive. So it may be that having no kids has impacted my view. I just felt the place was generally out dated and lacking much modern insight into science. For example it would have been fun to see the",
          "we have been here afew times and it is always a bit of fun, they did the titanic a while ago and that was really good",
          "We came across the Science Park by accident whilst looking for our Hotel in Granada, and decided to give it a visit. It is closed on Sundays and Mondays. But we went for a quick visit before heading home on the Tuesday. Well.. The quick visit ended up being a full day visit!",
          "I could have spent hours in the butterfly house. The staff were very informative telling us about the butterflies and we watched as one hatched. Although we spent the day there I don't think we saw everything. Fantastic for children as lots of interactive exhibits.",
          "We got the \"bono tur\u00edstico\" and planned to spend half a day at the Science park, but there is so much to see and our children (aged 10 and 13) liked it so much, that we actually stayed there for the whole day! The food at the restaurant was also very nice and reasonably priced.",
          "I've visited this Science Park before and enjoyed the experience but this week I took my 2 yr old grandchild and she liked it so much we went back again 3 days later. Went for the benefit of the air con on a scorching day but there's so much to see and do whatever your age, it's",
          "A very modern and interativo Park , the kids just loved. Besides being a Nice place it's the right place have the kids learning on practical way what they have in the school.",
          "Great as it was empty, loads for kids to play with and explore. Spent about 5-6 hours here.",
          "I got there really late, so only had a short time to run through the exhibits. The dinosaur exhibit was amazing. Though, I should mention its been a while since I've been to one. The human body one was also very interesting, though probably not good to do if you've just eaten or",
          "Plenty to see and do for all the family. Changes of expositions.",
          "I went here with school while staying in Granada, I went to 2 exhibitions: human body and dinasaur, both were excelant. The human body one exceptionaly intresting and interactive. We also went to the planetarium, unfortunely it was all in spanish. I fell asleep. Overall this was",
          "We spent a rainy afternoon at the Science Park & it was a nice way to spend a few hours. The exhibits change so it won\u2019t always be the same stuff. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a \u201cmust do\u201d in Granada (because it could really be anywhere in the world it just happens to be in Granada)",
          "Lots of things to see and experiment, we parents loved it as much as the kids did. Our favourite were \"travel to the human body\": Very helpful staff too. Dinosaurs exhibition was on, that was quite good too. The Planetarium show was excellent, very informative. It's not hugely",
          "The Science Park ads and description sound much better than the parc actually is. It is very basic and unless you have small children with you (up to 10), it is a bit too simple to really tickle your brain cells.",
          "The science Park is amazingly varied from birds of prey displays to the history of Spain and the Middle Eastern influence and civilisation. If there had been another rainy day, we would have gone for a second day. Don't know if Thursday is school trip day but there were hundreds",
          "This attraction is well worthy of an entire day's visit. The restaurant (cafe with self service) is very mediocre. The only disappointment was the butterfly pavillion ... I only saw 4 butterflies! If one needs a taxi on exiting, this can be requested at the information desk,",
          "Great place to spend a few hours, especially if you like \"Science and Industry\" type of exhibits. Make sure you plan some extra time in order to view a documentary in the planetarium. A tiny and very cosy planetarium with a very low entrance fee.",
          "This museum is worth visiting when in Granada. All of there exhibits were very well put together and very educational. Getting there is doable by bus.",
          "I live in Valencia, home to the Spanish National Science Museum and wasn't really expecting very much but was very pleasantly surprised. The museum is really big with lots of variety and really interesting and interactive. Much better than the Valencia one! We didn't really give",
          "i loved the place. especially if you re travelling with your kids, you got to take them there. it's a brilliant way to introduce sciences to them. and of course not only for kids, but for adults too. Loved the views from the top floor. Definitely one of those places to visit in",
          "Just in case - take comfortable shoes and photocamera",
          "Right after reading some reviews here I wasn't even sure if we should visit this place. However I am glad we did go and my kids had a ball and LOVED it. I wonder if the person who gave it a thumbs down for not having enough to do here has a map of the whole place. Its BIG but it",
          "The Science Park is a very interesting place for adults and children to visit. I think that children will especially enjoy this. The Observation Tower has good views of the city. You can see many butterflies flying in the Tropical Butterfly House. The Science Park was very well",
          "We came here only because the park was included in out Granada Tourist Bono card. Glad we made the trip here. Easy to get there via bus from town center. Plan on at least a few hours here exploring everything. Lots of hands on and interactive displays. The t-Rex Exhibit and the",
          "The main idea of this place is...\"we aren't a tipical museum\", it has a lot of expositions dedicated to many diferent topics and the main rule is \"touch everthing\", an intereactive experience in which you'll enjoy the time as well as you'll learn many principles of the daily",
          "The Parque de Ciencias is so much fun! It's interactive for kids and grown-ups alike. There are many different exhibits, including a bird of prey show outdoors! It's a good idea to take the glass elevator up to the observation deck and look all around the city through the",
          "Loved the birds of prey, and the robot made us laugh.View from the top of the observation tower is wonderful.",
          "Everything there is getting shabby. Someone needs to get things working right; you cannot show science to kids when your tools (computers, exhibits, slideshows, gadgets, etc) are not working properly.",
          "We loved the Science Museum, Parque de las Ciencias near downtown Granada near the river. We could walk from the center of town where we had lunch near the old Bazaar. There are exhibits inside and outside, and also a butterfly house that is incredible. Children were all over",
          "we didn't have a lot of time to really enjoy the science park but wish we had more time to go around it properly. it seemed really informative and was really focused on making science accessible and interesting to kids. the tower provided fantastic views of the mountains- if",
          "We've been to the park the only day it was rainning and we spent the whole day (it is included in the city pass). It's very interesting both for adults and kids: interactive experiences - trip in the human body, perception, workshops, butterflies greenhouse, observation tower.",
          "I loved this place. We have a \"hands on\" science centre at home in cardiff but this had the added bonus of great weather as lots of it is outdoors. Loved the birds of prey and the butterfly house. If you get a chance to go soon then don't miss the Escher exhibition - amazing!",
          "No shortage of things to do in the science park, was with a school trip so didn't have enough time to see everything they had on offer. Loved everything in it, from the taxidermy exhibit , the falconry display to the talking robot. It definitely was a day well spent! You should",
          "Spent all day there. Exhibits great- lots are hands on. Planetarium good and available in English one a day. Kept our 12 & 13 year olds well entertained The on site food was very average and probably the most expensive we have had all week so far in spain - though pretty good",
          "We were in a 20 days family meeting around Costa del Sol + Granada. We went with 2 kids (8 + 6) and a baby (1 1/2 y.o.) to visit the Science Park and Planetarium. Note that we speak Spanish, so all the activties were fun for kids... My son (8 y.o) loves science and wanted to see",
          "There are a lot of great things to see here. The taxidermy exhibit is extraordinary. It is wonderful for kids. But, especially, if you are going to go before 8 January 2012, don't miss the Escher exhibition. It is extremely well done. The computer graphics explaining his work",
          "The Science Park is a brilliant day out. It costs 6 euro and if you add on the Planitarium it's 8 euro 50 and this is well worth doing. We were there for about 6 hours, there's so much to do. Lots of fun and very interesting for all ages.",
          "My husband and i are in our 20's and he is a bit of a nerd (and i use this word as a compliment) so we thought a quick visit to the science park will be a nice stop. I am not a science person at all and never was always more into literature and history. i am telling you all this",

        "wiki": "Granada ( gr\u0259-NAH-d\u0259, Spanish: [\u0261\u027ea\u02c8na\u00f0a]) , locally [\u0261\u027ea\u02c8na] is the capital city of the province of Granada, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. Granada is located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the confluence of four rivers, the Darro, the Genil, the Monachil and the Beiro. It sits at an average elevation of 738 m (2,421 ft) above sea level, yet is only one hour by car from the Mediterranean coast, the Costa Tropical. Nearby is the Sierra Nevada Ski Station, where the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 were held.\nIn the 2005 national census, the population of the city of Granada proper was 236,982, and the population of the entire urban area was estimated to be 472,638, ranking as the 13th-largest urban area of Spain. About 3.3% of the population did not hold Spanish citizenship, the largest number of these people (31%; or 1% of the total population) coming from South America. Its nearest airport is Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca Granada-Ja\u00e9n Airport.\nThe Alhambra, an Arab citadel and palace, is located in Granada. It is the most renowned building of the Islamic historical legacy with its many cultural attractions and architectural elements that make Granada a popular destination among the tourist cities of Spain. The Almohad influence on architecture is also preserved in the Granada neighborhood called the Albaic\u00edn with its fine examples of Moorish and Morisco construction.  Granada is also well-known within Spain for the University of Granada which has an estimated 82,000 students spread over five different campuses in the city.  The pomegranate (in Spanish, granada) is the heraldic device of Granada.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Umayyad history ===\n\nThe region surrounding what today is Granada has been populated since at least 5500 BC and experienced Roman and Visigothic influences. The most ancient ruins found in the city belong to an Iberian oppidum called Ilturir, in the region known as Bastetania. This oppidum eventually changed its name to Iliberri, and after the Roman conquest of Iberia, to Municipium Florentinum Iliberitanum.\n\n\n=== Founding and early history ===\n\nThe Umayyad conquest of Hispania, starting in AD 711, brought large parts of the Iberian Peninsula under Moorish control and established al-Andalus. Granada's historical name in the Arabic language was \u063a\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0629 (\u0120arn\u0101\u1e6dah). The word G\u00e1rnata (or Karnatah) possibly means \"hill of strangers\". Because the city was situated on a low plain and, as a result, difficult to protect from attacks, the ruler decided to transfer his residence to the higher situated area of G\u00e1rnata. According to Arabic sources Ilbira (Elvira) was razed during Fitna of al-Andalus, afterwards it was not restored at its previous place and instead Garnata, which was a Jewish ghetto before, replaced it as the main city. In a short time this town was transformed into one of the most important cities of al-Andalus.In the early 11th century, after the collapse of the Umayyad Caliphate, the Berber Zawi ben Ziri established an independent kingdom for himself, the Taifa of Granada. His surviving memoirs \u2013 the only ones for the Spanish \"Middle Ages\" \u2013 provide considerable detail for this brief period. The Zirid Taifa of Granada was a Jewish state in all but name; the Muslim king is looked upon as a mainly symbolic figurehead. It was the center of Jewish Sephardi culture and scholarship.\n\nEarly Arabic writers repeatedly called it \"Garnata al-Yahud\" (Granada of the Jews).... Granada was in the eleventh century the center of Sephardic civilization at its peak, and from 1027 until 1066 Granada was a powerful Jewish state. Jews did not hold the foreigner (dhimmi) status typical of Islamic rule. Samuel ibn Nagrilla, recognized by Sephardic Jews everywhere as the quasi-political ha-Nagid ('The Prince'), was king in all but name. As vizier he made policy and\u2014much more unusual\u2014led the army.... It is said that Samuel's strengthening and fortification of Granada was what permitted it, later, to survive as the last Islamic state in the Iberian peninsula.\nAll of the greatest figures of eleventh-century Hispano-Jewish culture are associated with Granada. Moses Ibn Ezra was from Granada; on his invitation Judah ha-Levi spent several years there as his guest. Ibn Gabirol\u2019s patrons and hosts were the Jewish viziers of Granada, Samuel ha-Nagid and his son Joseph.\nWhen Joseph took over after his father's death, he proved to lack his father's diplomacy, bringing on the 1066 Granada massacre, which ended the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain.\nBy the end of the 11th century, the city had spread across the Darro to reach the hill of the future Alhambra, and included the Albaic\u00edn neighborhood (now a World Heritage site). The Almoravids ruled Granada from 1090 and the Almohad dynasty from 1166.\n\n\n=== Nasrid dynasty\u2014Emirate of Granada ===\n\nIn 1228, with the departure of the Almohad prince Idris al-Ma'mun, who left Iberia to take the Almohad leadership, the ambitious Ibn al-Ahmar established the last and longest reigning Muslim dynasty in the Iberian peninsula, the Nasrids. With the Reconquista in full swing after the conquest of C\u00f3rdoba in 1236, the Nasrids aligned themselves with Fernando III of Castile, officially becoming the Emirate of Granada in 1238. Most historians agree that Granada became a tributary state to the Kingdom of Castile from that year, although this was often interrupted by wars between the two states. It provided connections with Muslim and Arab trade centers, particularly for gold from sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb, and exported silk and dried fruits produced in the area. The Nasrids also supplied troops from the Emirate and mercenaries from North Africa for service to Castile.\nIbn Battuta, a famous traveller and an authentic historian, visited the Kingdom of Granada in 1350. He described it as a powerful and self-sufficient kingdom in its own right, although frequently embroiled in skirmishes with the Kingdom of Castile. In his journal, Ibn Battuta called Granada the \"metropolis of Andalusia and the bride of its cities.\"During the Moor rule, Granada was a city with adherents to many religions and ethnicities (Arabs, Berbers, Christians and Jews) who lived in separate quarters. During this Nasrid period there were 137 Muslim mosques in the Medina (city) of Granada.\n\n\n=== Reconquista and the 16th century ===\n\nOn January 2, 1492, the last Muslim ruler in Iberia, Emir Muhammad XII of Granada, known as \"Boabdil\" to the Spanish, surrendered complete control of the Emirate of Granada to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, Los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos (\"the Catholic Monarchs\"), after the last battle of the Granada War.\nThe 1492 surrender of the Kingdom of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs is one of the most significant events in Granada's history as it marks the completion of the Reconquista. The terms of the surrender, expressed in the Alhambra Decree treaty, explicitly allowed the city's Muslim inhabitants, known as Mud\u00e9jars, to continue unmolested in the practice of their faith and customs. By 1499, however, Cardinal Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros grew frustrated with the slow pace of the efforts of the first archbishop of Granada, Hernando de Talavera, to convert non-Christians to Christianity and undertook a program of forced Christian baptisms, creating the Converso (convert) class for Muslims and Jews. Cisneros's new tactics, which were a direct violation of the terms of the treaty, provoked the Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1499\u20131501) centered in the rural Alpujarras region southwest of the city.\nResponding to the rebellion of 1501, the Castilian Crown rescinded the Alhambra Decree treaty, and mandated that Granada's Muslims convert or emigrate. Under the 1492 Alhambra Decree, Spain's Jewish population, unlike the Muslims, had already been forced to convert under threat of expulsion or even execution, becoming Marranos (meaning \"pigs\" in Spanish), or Catholics of Jewish descent. Many of the elite Muslim class subsequently emigrated to North Africa. The majority of the Granada's Mud\u00e9jar Muslims converted so that they could stay, however, becoming Moriscos, or Catholics of Moorish descent (\"Moor\" being equivalent to Muslim). Both populations of conversos were subject to persecution, execution, or exile, and each had cells that practiced their original religion in secrecy.\nOver the course of the 16th century, Granada took on an ever more Catholic and Castilian character, as immigrants came to the city from other parts of the Iberian Peninsula. The city's mosques were converted to Christian churches or completely destroyed. New structures, such as the cathedral and the Chanciller\u00eda, or Royal Court of Appeals, transformed the urban landscape. After the 1492 Alhambra decree, which resulted in the majority of Granada's Jewish population being expelled, the Jewish quarter (ghetto) was demolished to make way for new Catholic and Castilian institutions and uses.\n\n\n==== Legacy ====\n\nThe fall of Granada has a significant place among the important events that mark the latter half of the Spanish 15th century. It completed the so-called \"Reconquista\" (or Christian reconquest) of the almost 800-year-long Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula. Spain, now without any major internal territorial conflict, embarked on a great phase of exploration and colonization around the globe. In the same year, the sailing expedition of Christopher Columbus resulted in what is usually claimed to be the first European sighting of the New World, although Leif Erikson is often regarded as the first European to land in the New World, 500 years before Christopher Columbus. The resources of the Americas enriched the crown and the country, allowing Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand to consolidate their rule as Catholic Monarchs of the united kingdoms. Subsequent conquests, and the Spanish colonization of the Americas by the maritime expeditions they commissioned, created the vast Spanish Empire: for a time, the largest in the world.\n\n\n== Heritage and monuments ==\nThe greatest artistic wealth of Granada is its Spanish-Islamic art \u2013 in particular, the compound of the Alhambra and the Generalife. The Generalife is a pleasure palace with attached romantic gardens, remarkable both for its location and layout, as well as for the diversity of its flowers, plants and fountains. The Alhambra is the architectural culmination of the works of Nasrid art that were undertaken in the 13th and 14th centuries, with most of the Alhambra having been built at the time of Yusuf I and Mohammed V, between 1333 and 1354.\nAt present, the buildings of Granada are typically bourgeois in appearance, with much of the architecture dating from the 19th Century, together with numerous Renaissance and Baroque buildings.\n\n\n=== Alhambra ===\n\nThe Alhambra is a Nasrid \"palace city\". It was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1984. It is certainly Granada's most emblematic monument and one of the most visited in Spain. It consists of a defensive zone, the Alcazaba, together with others of a residential and formal state character, the Nasrid Palaces and, lastly, the palace, gardens and orchards of the Generalife.\nThe Alhambra occupies a small plateau on the southeastern border of the city in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada above the Assabica valley. Some of the buildings may have existed before the arrival of the Moors. The Alhambra as a whole is completely walled, bordered to the north by the valley of the Darro, to the south by the al-Sabika, and to the east of the Cuesta del Rey Chico, which in turn is separated from the Albaic\u00edn and Generalife, located in the Cerro del Sol.\nIn the 11th century the Castle of the Alhambra was developed as a walled town which became a military stronghold that dominated the whole city. But it was in the 13th century, with the arrival of the first monarch of the Nasrid dynasty, Muhammad I of Granada (Mohammed I, 1238\u20131273), that the royal residence was established in the Alhambra. This marked the beginning of its heyday. The Alhambra became palace, citadel and fortress, and was the residence of the Nasrid sultans and their senior officials, including servants of the court and elite soldiers (13th\u201314th centuries).\nIn 1492 the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabela, expelled the final Moors from the city of Granada. They established permanent residency in the Alhambra, and it was here that Christopher Columbus requested royal endorsement for his westward expedition that year.\nIn 1527 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor demolished part of the architectural complex to build the Palace which bears his name. Although the Catholic Monarchs had already altered some rooms of the Alhambra after the conquest of the city in 1492, Charles V wanted to construct a permanent residence befitting an emperor. Around 1537 he ordered the construction of the Peinador de la Reina, or Queen's dressing room, where his wife Isabel lived, over the Tower of Abu l-Hayyay.\n\nThere was a pause in the ongoing maintenance of the Alhambra from the 18th century for almost a hundred years, and during control by the First French Empire, substantial portions of the fortress were blown apart. The repair, restoration and conservation that continues to this day did not begin until the 19th century. The complex currently includes the Museum of the Alhambra, with objects mainly from the site of the monument itself and the Museum of Fine Arts.\n\n\n=== Generalife ===\n\nThe Generalife is a garden area attached to the Alhambra which became a place of recreation and rest for the Granadan Muslim kings when they wanted to flee the tedium of official life in the Palace. It occupies the slopes of the hill Cerro del Sol above the ravines of the Genil and the Darro and is visible from vantage points throughout the city. It was conceived as a rural village, consisting of landscaping, gardens and architecture. The palace and gardens were built during the reign of Muhammed III (1302\u20131309) and redecorated shortly after by Abu l-Walid Isma'il (1313\u20131324). It is of the Islamic Nasrid style, and is today one of the biggest attractions in the city of Granada. The Generalife was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984.\nIt is difficult to know the original appearance of the Generalife, as it has been subject to modifications and reconstructions throughout the Christian period which disfigured many of its former aspects. All buildings of the Generalife are of solid construction, and the overall decor is austere and simple. There is little variety to the Alhambra's decorative plaster, but the aesthetic is tasteful and extremely delicate. In the last third of the 20th century, a part of the garden was destroyed to build an auditorium.\n\n\n=== Cathedral ===\n\nThe cathedral of Granada is built over the Nasrid Great Mosque of Granada, in the centre of the city. Its construction began during the Spanish Renaissance in the early 16th century, shortly after the conquest of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs, who commissioned the works to Juan Gil de Honta\u00f1\u00f3n and Enrique Egas. Numerous grand buildings were built in the reign of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, so that the cathedral is contemporary to the Christian palace of the Alhambra, the University and the Real Chanciller\u00eda (Supreme Court).\nThe church was conceived on the model of the Cathedral of Toledo, for what initially was a Gothic architectural project, as was customary in Spain in the early decades of the 16th century. However, Egas was relieved by the Catholic hierarchy in 1529, and the continuation of the work was assigned to Diego Siloe, who built upon the example of his predecessor, but changed the approach towards a fully Renaissance aesthetic.The architect drew new Renaissance lines for the whole building over the gothic foundations, with an ambulatory and five naves instead of the usual three. Over time, the bishopric continued to commission new architectural projects of importance, such as the redesign of the main fa\u00e7ade, undertaken in 1664 by Alonso Cano (1601\u20131667) to introduce Baroque elements. In 1706 Francisco de Hurtado Izquierdo and later his collaborator Jos\u00e9 Bada built the current tabernacle of the cathedral.\nHighlights of the church's components include the main chapel, where may be found the praying statues of the Catholic Monarchs, which consists of a series of Corinthian columns with the entablature resting on their capitals, and the vault over all. The spaces of the walls between the columns are perforated by a series of windows. The design of the tabernacle of 1706 preserves the classic proportions of the church, with its multiple columns crossing the forms of Diego de Silo\u00e9.\n\n\n=== Royal Chapel ===\n\nThe Catholic Monarchs chose the city of Granada as their burial site by a royal decree dated September 13, 1504. The Royal Chapel of Granada, built over the former terrace of the Great Mosque, ranks with other important Granadan buildings such as the Lonja and the Catedral e Iglesia del Sagrario. In it are buried the Catholic Monarchs, their daughter Joanna of Castile (Juana la Loca) and her husband Felipe I (Felipe el Hermoso). Construction of the Chapel started in 1505, directed by its designer, Enrique Egas. Built in several stages, the continuing evolution of its design joined Gothic construction and decoration with Renaissance ideals, as seen in the tombs and the 17th and 18th century Granadan art in the Chapel of Santa Cruz. Over the years the church acquired a treasury of works of art, liturgical objects and relics.\nThe Royal Chapel was declared a Historic Artistic Monument on May 19, 1884, taking consideration of BIC (Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural) status in the current legislation of Spanish Historical Heritage (Law 16/1985 of 25 June). The most important parts of the chapel are its main retable, grid and vault. In the Sacristy-Museum is the legacy of the Catholic Monarchs. Its art gallery is highlighted by works of the Flemish, Italian and Spanish schools.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Albayz\u00edn ===\n\nThe Albayz\u00edn (or Albaic\u00edn) is a neighborhood of Al-Andalus origin, much visited by tourists who flock to the city because of its historical associations, architecture, and landscape.\nThe archeological findings in the area show that it has been inhabited since ancient times. It became more relevant with the arrival of the Zirid dynasty, in 1013, when it was surrounded by defensive walls. It is one of the ancient centres of Granada, like the Alhambra, the Realejo and the Arrabal de Bib-Rambla, in the flat part of the city. Its current extension runs from the walls of the Alcazaba to the cerro of San Miguel and on the other hand, from the Puerta de Guadix to the Alcazaba.\nThis neighborhood had its greatest development in the Nasrid era, and therefore largely maintains the urban fabric of this period, with narrow streets arranged in an intricate network that extends from the upper area, called San Nicol\u00e1s, to the river Darro and Calle Elvira, located in the Plaza Nueva. The traditional type of housing is the carmen granadino, consisting of a free-standing house surrounded by a high wall that separates it from the street and includes a small orchard or garden.\nIn the Muslim era the Albayz\u00edn was characterized as the locus of many revolts against the caliphate. At that time it was the residence of craftsmen, industrialists and aristocrats. With the Christian reconquest, it would progressively lose its splendor. The Christians built churches and settled there the Real Chanciller\u00eda. During the rule of Felipe II of Spain, after the rebellion and subsequent expulsion of the Moors, the district was depopulated. In 1994 it was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site. Of its architectural wealth among others include the Ziri walls of the Alcazaba Cadima, the Nasrid walls, the towers of the Alcazaba, the churches of Salvador (former main mosque), San Crist\u00f3bal, San Miguel Alto and the Real Chanciller\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Sacromonte ===\n\nThe Sacromonte neighbourhood is located on the Valpara\u00edso hill, one of several hills that make up Granada. This neighborhood is known as the old neighbourhood of the Romani, who settled in Granada after the conquest of the city. It is one of the most picturesque neighborhoods, full of whitewashed caves cut into the rock and used as residences. The sound of strumming guitars may still be heard there in the performance of flamenco cantes and quej\u00edos, so that over time it has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in Granada.\nAt the top of this hill is the Abbey of Sacromonte and the College of Sacromonte, founded in the 17th century by the then Archbishop of Granada Pedro de Castro. The Abbey of Sacromonte was built to monitor and guard the alleged relics of the evangelists of Baetica. Those are of questionable authenticity, but since their finding the area has been a religious pilgrimage destination.The abbey complex consists of the catacombs, the abbey (17th\u201318th centuries), the Colegio Viejo de San Dionisio Areopagita (17th century) and the Colegio Nuevo (19th century). The interior of the church is simple and small but has numerous excellent works of art, which accentuate the size and rich carving of the Crucificado de Risue\u00f1o, an object of devotion for the Romani people, who sing and dance in the procession of Holy Week. The facilities also include a museum, which houses the works acquired by the Foundation.\n\n\n=== Charterhouse ===\n\nThe Charterhouse of Granada is a monastery of cloistered monks, located in what was a farm or Muslim almunia called Aynadamar (\"fountain of tears\") that had an abundance of water and fruit trees. The initiative to build the monastery in that place was begun by Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, known as El Gran Capit\u00e1n. The charterhouse was founded in 1506; construction started ten years later, and continued for the following 300 years.\nThe Monastery suffered heavy damage during the Peninsular War and lost considerable property in 1837 as a result of the confiscations of Mendiz\u00e1bal. Currently, the monastery belongs to the Carthusians, reporting directly to the Archdiocese of Granada.The street entrance to the complex is an ornate arch of Plateresque style. Through it one reaches a large courtyard, at the end which is a wide staircase leading to the entrance of the church. The church, of early 16th century style and plan, has three entrances, one for the faithful and the other two for monks and clergy. Its plan has a single nave divided into four sections, highlighting the retables of Juan S\u00e1nchez Cot\u00e1n and the chancel's glass doors, adorned with mother-of-pearl, silver, rare woods and ivory. The presbytery is covered by elliptical vaulting. The main altar, between the chancel arch and the church tabernacle, is gilded wood.\nThe church's tabernacle and sancta sanctorum are considered a masterpiece of Baroque Spanish art in its blend of architecture, painting and sculpture. The dome that covers this area is decorated with frescoes by the C\u00f3rdoba artist Antonio Palomino (18th century) representing the triumph of the Church Militant, faith, and religious life.\nThe courtyard, with galleries of arches on Doric order columns opening on it, is centered by a fountain. The Chapter House of Legos is the oldest building of the monastery (1517). It is rectangular and covered with groin vaulting.Mosque of Granada\nThe Mosque of Granada was inaugurated in 2003 on the summit of the neighborhood of Albayzin. The mosque was built near the Church of San Salvador and the Church of San Nicol\u00e1s. The Church of San Salvador was built on the site of the Great Mosque of Albayzin. The Society for the Return of Islam in Spain purchased the site in 1981, but it took many years for the plans to be approved. The mosque's initial funding was supplied by Shaykh 'Abdalqadir as-Sufi al-Murabit who envisioned providing Granada's new Spanish Muslim community with a mosque. Additional funding came from Malaysia, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. In 1991 the CIE (Comunidad Isl\u00e1mica en Espa\u00f1a) hired the architect Renato Ramirez Sanchez to design the mosque. In the 1990s, there was a heated debate pertaining to the design of the minaret. Construction eventually began in 2001. The mosque now serves about 500 people.\n\n\n=== Palace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar ===\nThe Palace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar was built in one of the most emblematic streets of Granada, the Carrera del Darro, at number 5. This place is an architectural example of the classical Granada during the Renaissance transformation of the XVIth century. It was built by the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar, great-grandson of both Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez del Pulgar (known by the name of El de la Haza\u00f1as [The One of the Valiant Deeds]) and Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (El Gran Capit\u00e1n [The Great Captain]), Captain-General of the Castilian-Aragonese forces that concluded the Reconquest of the peninsula. The palace is now the museum of perfumes El Patio de los Perfumes, with 1,500 square metres (16,000 sq ft) of floor space on two floors and 130 square metres (1,400 sq ft) of patio to relax surrounded by flowers and perfumes.\n\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nMonasterio de San Jer\u00f3nimo: monastery\nSan Juan de Dios Hospital\nCastril Palace\nMuseo de Bellas Artes de Granada\nMadrasah of Granada\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area of Granada ===\nGranada's metropolitan area consists of about fifty municipalities and the capital. Although it is not formally constituted as a political and administrative body, there are several public services that are combined. The arrival of many inhabitants of the capital and other towns in the province, influences a large Population growth. Despite the fact that the capital loses inhabitants, who move to neighboring towns. The main causes of the exodus towards the towns of the metropolitan area are, mainly, the difficulty of accessing a home in the capital because of the high prices it has and labor reasons, because in the towns of the periphery the majority are being located of industrial estates.\n\n\n=== Capital of Granada Province ===\nThe city of Granada is the capital of the province of the same name, thus all administrative entities of provincial scope dependent on the regional government and the state are located there. There is a provincial delegation from each of the governmental departments to the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, coordinated by a government delegate under the Ministry of the Interior. The national government of Spain has a sub-delegation in Granada, subordinate to the government delegate in the autonomous community.\n\n\n=== Judicial administration ===\nThe headquarters of the Superior Court of Justice of Andalusia, Ceuta and Melilla is in Granada, located in Plaza Nueva, in the building of the historic Royal Chancery, as well as the Superior Prosecutor's Office of Andalusia, located in the building of the Bank of Spain. It has a Provincial Court, located in Corteza del Carmen Street, and is also head of the Judicial Party No. 3 of the province, whose demarcation includes the city and 49 towns, some of them very populated, in the metropolitan area region.\nMost of the courts are located in two administrative buildings, in Plaza Nueva and Avenida del Sur. The set of judicial bodies is as follows: \n\nSuperior Court of Justice: President. Civil-Criminal Chamber. Contentious-Administrative Room. Social room.\nProvincial Court: President. Criminal: 2; Civil: 3\nCourts\n\n\n=== Municipal organization ===\nIts political administration is carried out through a City Council, of democratic management, whose components are chosen every four years by universal suffrage. The electoral roll is composed of all residents registered in Granada over 18 years of age, of Spanish nationality and of the other member countries of the European Union. According to the provisions of the General Electoral Regime Law, which establishes the number of eligible councilors according to the population of the municipality, the Municipal Corporation of Granada is made up of 27 councilors. In the municipal elections held in 2019 the constitution of the City Council was eleven councilors belonging to the Popular Party, eight to the Socialist Party, four belonging to Citizens Party, three to Vamos, Granada and one to the United Left-Socialist Alternative-For the People. After these results with the rise of the new political forces, PP and PSOE lost power; and after negotiations an agreement was reached with which Jos\u00e9 Torres Hurtado, mayor of the Popular Party, continues as mayor, under the supervision of the regeneration compliance required by the Citizens party. After his resignation, due to his involvement in Operation Serrallo / Nazar\u00ed, the socialist Francisco Cuenca was appointed mayor.\n\n\n=== Municipal districts and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Granada consists of eight districts whose population is distributed in the attached chart according to the 2009 census of the City of Granada. These districts formed a set of 36 neighborhoods. All boundaries of districts and neighborhoods were modified in February 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal service areas ===\nThe municipal government team has organized the distribution of management responsibilities, structuring itself in the following service areas: Weddings and Palaces, Equal opportunities, Economy, Education, Communication office, Unified license management, Youth, Environment, Municipal Office of Consumer Information, Citizen Participation, Group of Civil Protection Volunteers, Local Police.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n\n=== Realejo ===\nRealejo was the Jewish district in the time of the Nasrid Granada. (The centuries since the Jewish population were so important that Granada was known in Al-Andalus under the name of \"Granada of the Jews\", Arabic: \u063a\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648\u062f\u200e Gharn\u0101\u1e6dah al-Yah\u016bd.) It is today a district made up of many Granadinian villas, with gardens opening onto the streets, called Los C\u00e1rmenes.\n\n\n=== Cartuja ===\nThis district contains the Carthusian monastery of the same name: Cartuja. This is an old monastery started in a late Gothic style with Baroque exuberant interior decorations. In this district also, many buildings were created with the extension of the University of Granada.\n\n\n=== Bib-Rambla ===\nThe toponym derives from a gate (Bab al-Ramla, or the Gate of the Ears) that was built when Granada was controlled by the Nasrid dynasty. Nowadays, Bib-Rambla is a high point for gastronomy, especially in its terraces of restaurants, open on beautiful days. The Arab bazaar (Alcaicer\u00eda) is made up of several narrow streets, which start from this place and continue as far as the cathedral\n\n\n=== Sacromonte ===\n\nThe Sacromonte neighborhood is located on the extension of the hill of Albaic\u00edn, along the Darro River. This area, which became famous by the nineteenth century for its predominantly Gitano inhabitants, is characterized by cave houses, which are dug into the hillside. The area has a reputation as a major center of flamenco song and dance, including the Zambra Gitana, an Andalusian dance originating in the Middle East. The zone is a protected cultural environment under the auspices of the Centro de Interpretaci\u00f3n del Sacromonte, a cultural center dedicated to the preservation of Gitano cultural forms.\n\n\n=== Zaid\u00edn ===\n\nThis formerly blue collar but now upmarket neighborhood houses 100,000 residents of Granada, making it the largest neighborhood or 'barrio'. Traditionally populated by Romani people, now many residents are from North and West Africa, China, and many South American countries. Every Saturday morning it hosts a large outdoor market or \"mercadillo\", where many people come and sell their wares of fruits and vegetables, clothes and shoes, and other odds and ends.\n\n\n== Gastronomy ==\nThe gastronomy of Granada is part of the Arabic-Andalusian cuisine tradition, with a strong Arab and Jewish heritage, which is reflected in its condiments and spices, such as cumin, coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon, raisins, almonds or honey. The writer Miguel Alcobendas, author of the traditional cuisine of Granada, says that it has its origin in living together, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century (when Granada surrendered to the Catholic Kings), of Muslims, Jews and Christians in the Nasrid Kingdom from Granada. Subsequently there was a miscegenation with the kitchen of the Christians, in which the pork acquired an importance in the kitchen of Granada more than in the rest of Spain, since its consumption allowed its eaters to demonstrate a certain distance from the persecuted religions, since both Muslims and Jews have it banned.\nThe climatic differences of the different regions of the province, from the coast to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada propitiates a great variety of raw materials: vegetables], meats and sausages, fish that are combined in a multitude of dishes and recipes for soups and stews.\nThe famous and reputed Trev\u00e9lez ham comes from the Sierra of Granada, to which other pork derivatives are added, sausages such as chorizo, black pudding and pork tenderloin.\nHam and beans, two products of the land, are combined in one of its most typical dishes, beans with ham; Other known dishes are the Sacromonte tortilla, which among other ingredients must have cooked brains and veal crustaillas, chopped and sauted before mixing with the egg. It is also worth mentioning \"papas a lo pobre\", potatoes which are usually served with egg and fried peppers, as well as with pieces of pork or ham.\nAmong the stews and potajes, the pot of San Ant\u00f3n stands out, which is eaten mainly towards the second half of January; cabbage stew, which combines vegetables and legumes; the stew of green beans and fennel; The thistle and pumpkin casserole, with noodles and aromatic herbs, or gypsy pottery are other dishes of the land. \nConfectionery is well represented in the gastronomy of Granada, for sweets prepared by the nuns can be purchased in the numerous convents of the city: the pesti\u00f1os of V\u00e9lez or those of the Encarnaci\u00f3n, the puff pastries of San Jer\u00f3nimo, the moles of San Ant\u00f3n eggs, the Zafra biscuit, sweet potato rolls, cocas, roscos from Santo Tomas and mantecados. Aljoj\u00e1banas, honey and cheese dumplings and some of the fritters called almohados, as well as fig bread, Moorish roscos and an almond cake called soy\u00e1 are all of Arabic heritage. \nUnlike in other provinces of Andalusia, in Granada tapas (appetizers or snacks) are usually free in bars and restaurants. \"Bar hopping\" (Ir de tapas) and eating tapas in the time between finishing work and having dinner is a deeply rooted traditional activity among the people of Granada. There are different tapas routes around the city.\n\n\n== Leisure and entertainment ==\nIn Granada there is a wide program of leisure and entertainment, which covers a large number of fields, available to both visitors and citizens themselves. Of the leisure activities carried out, the following can be highlighted: \n\nThe zambras of Sacromonte. Old bridal parties held by the gypsies of the city, and that disappeared for years before their current vindication. They develop in the caves of the Sacromonte neighborhood and have a unique character in the world of flamenco. There are also more classic flamenco shows in the Albaic\u00edn. These flamenco shows, usually linked to restaurants, are one of the city's cultural attractions.\nFestivals. Granada has a very complete range of events: International Music and Dance Festival, International Jazz Festival, Granada Festival South Cinemas and International Tango Festival, among others.\nConcerts. Throughout the year there is a stable program of concerts in the Manuel de Falla Auditorium and theater and opera performances in the Congress Palace.\nParties. Throughout the year several parties are held on significant dates for religious, civil or cultural reasons.\n\n\n== Social welfare ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\n\n==== University ====\nThe University of Granada (UGR), founded in 1531 by Carlos I, meant the continuation of higher studies in La Madraza, when the city was the capital of the last Nasrid Kingdom. The University of Granada has become internationally recognized in all university fields: teaching, research, cultural and services to its members and its surroundings. It is therefore one of the destinations that receives more exchange students from the Erasmus Program13 and the fourth Spanish university in number of students, after the Complutense University of Madrid, and the University of Seville. \n\n\n==== Obligatory education ====\nIn the city there are a total of 69 compulsory secondary education centers. Infant and primary education is taught in 104 centers, distributed among private, concerted and public centers. There are also five adult education centers.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nIts public health system is the exclusive competence of the autonomous community, which provides two types of attention: primary, which constitutes the first level of access to the system; and the specialized one. Health centers and offices constitute the offer of primary care, differing from each other in the level of care they provide.\n\n\n==== Hospital network ====\nIts hospital network is basically composed of public hospitals managed by the Andalusian Health Service and other smaller private management centers. This network covers the needs of the city and its Metropolitan Area.

For this reason, the Social Welfare Delegation of the City of Granada has several municipal community social services centers, one for each local district, coordinated by Los Mondragones Municipal Administration located on the Fuerzas Armadas Avenue. In its internal organization the services provided are organized around each municipal center and therefore of each municipal district but also around groups. \n\n\n== Parks and gardens in Granada ==\nThe city of Granada has a significant number of parks and gardens, including:\n\n\n== Climate ==\nGranada has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) close to a cold semi-arid climate (BSk) Summers are hot and dry with daily temperatures averaging 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F) in the hottest month (July); however, temperatures reaching over 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are not uncommon in the summer months. Winters are cool and damp, with most of the rainfall concentrated from November through to January. The coldest month is January with daytime temperatures hovering at 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) and dropping to around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) during the night. Frost is quite common as temperatures usually reach below-freezing in the early morning. Spring and autumn are unpredictable, with temperatures ranging from mild to warm. Early summer in 2017 confronted the city with two massive heat waves that broke long-standing record temperatures starting on June 13, 2017, with a new maximum high for the month at 40.6 \u00b0C (old record 40.0), which was topped three times within the span of four days at 40.9 \u00b0C on June 14, 41.3 (June 15) and, eventually, 41.5 (June 17).

        "wiki": "The Gate of the Pomegranates (Spanish: Puerta de las Granadas) is an historical access point of a pathway that leads through the Forest of the Alhambra to the Nasrid palace that is the Alhambra, located in the city of Granada, Spain. The path starts in the city centre, Plaza Nueva, and continues up the Cuesta de Gom\u00e9rez, before reaching the monument.\n\n\n== Style ==\nThe gate was constructed in the style of Roman triumphal arches, with a classic front fa\u00e7ade, making it the main entrance to the walled enclosure of the Alhambra. Built during the Spanish Renaissance, under the command of Emperor Charles V, the gate is made out of bonded stone carved with Florentine designs without roughing, which highlights the ashlars of the construction.\n\n\n== Brief History ==\nConstruction of the gate began in 1526 to commemorate the visit of Charles I of Spain to Granada after his wedding with Isabel of Portugal, according to the imperial program (Door of Justice, Pilar and Palace of Charles V). The idea was conceived by Luis Hurtado and executed by \u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez with help from the architect of the Palace of Carlos V, Pedro Machuca. The gate was built in substitution of the original Islamic gate, the Bib al-Buxar also known as Bib al-Jaudaq, which was a defensive tower that protected the valley located between the hill of the Sabica and the Mauror Mountain. Some of the original Arabic architecture can be seen on the right side of the gate and on its left side is a baroque door to the Palace of the Marquise of Cartagena.Formally known as the Door of the Gom\u00e9rez, the Gate of the Pomegranates receives its name from the three large open pomegranates that sit atop the main arch, accompanied by the imperial shield of Charles I of Spain and V of Germany and the allegorical figures of Peace and Abundance, concepts that the government of Charles I promised to contribute to the new lands of Al-Andalus.\nThe Alhambra Forest can be seen behind all arches of the gate with the right arch leading to Torres Bermejas, the Manuel de Falla Auditorium and the Carmen de los M\u00e1rtires, while the left side, formerly called Cuesta Empedrada, leads to the southern border of the Alhambra where the Doors of Justice and Doors of the Carts can be found.\nThe central arch, surrounded by Tuscan semi-columns, provides access to paved footpaths that lead to the Palace of Charles V, the church of Santa Maria de la Alhambra and the Parador Nacional de San Francisco.On the 10th February 1870, it was declared Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural as it was deemed an integrated part of the original wall surrounding the Alhambra. The gate is managed by the Direccion del Patronato de la Alhambra y Generalife.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBUR\u00cdN, ANTONIO. Artistic and Historical Guide of the City of Granada. Editorial Comares.

        "wiki": "Sacromonte, sometimes also called Sacramonte, is a traditional neighbourhood in the eastern area of the city of Granada in Andalusia, Spain. It is one of the six neighbourhoods that make up the urban district of Albayz\u00edn and borders the neighbourhoods of Albayz\u00edn, San Pedro, Realejo-San Mat\u00edas, El Fargue and Haza Grande. \nIt is located on the hillside and in the valley of Valpara\u00edso, opposite the Alhambra - emblem of Granada. The neighbourhood occupies both banks of the Darro river, whose name seems to be derived from the phrase \"d'auro\" (\"of gold\") because of its famous gold-bearing sediments.\nTraditionally the neighborhood of the Granadian Romani, who settled in Granada after the Christian conquest of the city in 1492, it is one of the most picturesque neighbourhoods of the city, with cave houses installed in whitewashed caves.The Romani of Sacromonte have a mixed language known as Cal\u00f3, which has seen a rapid decline in use over the past century. It is derived from India, where the Romani originated. The Romani of Sacromonte were famously portrayed by the poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca in his book of poems Romancero Gitano.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe neighborhood owes its name to an episode which occurred between 1595 and 1599 on the hill of Valpara\u00edso: the supposed discovery of relics and the so-called \"lead books\" or \"Lead Books of Sacromonte\", containing indecipherable drawings and texts in Latin and Arabic characters, which came to be interpreted by some as the fifth gospel. These findings were declared a forgery in the 17th century, but nonetheless led to the construction of the Abbey of Sacromonte, where the supposed relics of Saint Caecilius (co-patron of Granada) and the lead books are now kept.\n\n\n== Origin of the caves ==\n\nThe origin of the houses excavated on the slopes of Sacromonte, the traditional dwelling type of the neighborhood, is not very clear. It is assumed that they began to be built from the 16th century, after the Jewish and Muslim populations were expelled from their homes, and intermixed with the nomadic Romani, adopting some of their customs. The caves became housing for the marginalized, located outside the walls of the city, which meant being outside of administrative and ecclesiastical control, particularly the Spanish Inquisition. To dig a cave it was necessary to carve away a part of the face of the hill where they wanted to build, making a vertical cut that served as a facade. The builder then inserted an arch at the midpoint to serve as a door. They then excavated as much space for rooms as the terrain would allow.The forms and limits of this unique house type are determined by the terrain, altitude and extent of the hills where the excavation takes place, so there are no two identical caves. These elements, along with the paths, gullies, small squares, whitewashed facades and interiors form a unique landscape, alongside the customs and crafts of their inhabitants, giving the neighbourhood a unique character.In addition to the troglodyte houses, another important feature of the neighbourhood is the legends that relate to all corners and places, one of the most well-known being the Ravine of the Blacks.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== A neighbourhood legend: Ravine of the Blacks (Barranco de los Negros) ==\nPopular legends hold that after the loss of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs in the Granada War, the formerly ruling Arabs - who made their way in exile to African lands - never gave up hope of someday returning to the city of their parents and grandparents, where they and their children were born.\nAfraid of being preyed upon by bandits or groups of renegade Christian soldiers on the roads to the ports of Almu\u00f1\u00e9car or Almer\u00eda, where they embarked for Africa, they hid great treasures among the olive groves which at the time covered Sacromonte.At the same time, they granted freedom to the many slaves owned by the noble Arab families, because of the expense and difficulty of performing the journey with a large entourage. Many of these slaves were black, and had noticed the comings and goings of their former owners to Mount Valpara\u00edso (as the area was then called), were aware of their former owners' fears and had overheard many conversations between them regarding burying their possessions. Granted their freedom but without work or belongings, many decided to climb the mountain and recover for themselves the treasures that had once belonged to their former owners.They dug and dug into the slopes of the ravine reportedly without success, and exhausted by the effort but left with no alternative shelter, decided to condition the resulting caves and make them their homes. This gave the area the name of \"Ravine of the Blacks\", as these were believed to be the first inhabitants.\nIn later years, as Roma began to settle in the area, they supposedly attempted to use many spells in search of the exact places where the treasures were hidden. Many older witches, known as ferminib\u00ed, were reported to try talking with water and others with fire, or staring unblinking into basins of water, trying to get some clues to the locations of the lost treasures. To this day it is unknown whether any were discovered and secretly taken away by treasure seekers, or if the treasures remain hidden in the area.\n\n\n== Other sights ==\n\n\n=== Abbey and College of the Sacromonte; Holy Caves ===\nIn addition to the numerous caves, the main monument of the neighbourhood is the Abbey of Sacromonte, built by Archbishop Pedro de Castro y Qui\u00f1ones in 17th century near the summit of the hill, where the alleged relics and other remains of the first Christians of Granada and evangelizers of Roman Baetica; including Saint Caecilius, martyr and first bishop of the city in the 1st century CE; and other apostolic figures including companions of Saint James, were discovered. The College of Sacromonte was founded by Pedro de Castro as an annex to the abbey.The abbey consists of the abbey itself (17th century), the Old College of San Dionisio Areopagita (17th century), the New College (19th century) and the \"Holy Caves\" (Santas Cuevas). The abbey has an important library with numerous incunabula and manuscripts, but which is currently closed to the public. The Santas Cuevas are old catacombs which contain several chapels. In one of these, according to tradition, James the Less officiated. This is where the festival of Saint Caecilius takes place.\nThe abbey also contains the School of the Holy Mary, founded by teacher and priest Andr\u00e9s Manj\u00f3n - known as Padre Manj\u00f3n - at the beginning of 20th century to teach Romani children, and whose pedagogical innovations are still in use.\nThe abbey is the canonical seat of the Confraternity of the Romani. Mass is celebrated every Sunday at noon.\n\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nIn Carrera del Darro there are numerous monuments, including:\n\nThe Arabic Casa de Zafra, built at the end of the 14th century and which now serves as the headquarters of the Centro de Estudios Hist\u00f3ricos.\nCasa de Castril, dating from the 16th century, which has beautiful Mud\u00e9jar coffers and a plateresque facade. The building is currently operated by the Archaeological and Ethnological Museum of Granada.\nConvento de Santa Catarina de Zafra, founded in 1520, which includes a small preserved Arab house of the 11th century.\nPalacio de los C\u00f3rdova, built by the Dukes of Montellano, currently housing the Archive of Granada.\nIglesia de  San Gil y Santa Ana, a 16th century church.\nEl Ba\u00f1uelo or Bath del Nogal or de los Axares, a hamam (bathhouse) built on the Darro river in the 11th century during the reign of the Zirid King Badis ben Habus, one of the most well-preserved in Spain.\nFountain del Avellano, made famous by the works of \u00c1ngel Ganivet.\nThe Museum Caves of Sacromonte, an ethnographic museum.\n\n\n== Fiestas ==\nGranada celebrates the Fiestas de San Cecilio (Saint Caecilius) on the first Sunday in February with a pilgrimage to Sacromonte; the Carnival, also in February; and the D\u00eda de Mariana Pineda in May grows more important each year. Holy Week has rapidly achieved great importance. The neighbourhood of Sacromonte celebrates its own neighbourhood fiestas for the first ten days of August.\n\n\n== Native cuisine ==\n\nTortilla del Sacromonte\n\n\n== Famous Sacromontinos ==\nMariana Pineda\nChorrojumo\n\n\n== See also ==\nZambra, a dance which originated in this Granadian neighbourhood\n\n\n== Notes ==\nTranslated from the Portuguese and Spanish Wikipedias\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFlamenco recording from 1962 in Sacramento\nThe Wise Men of Sacromonte, 2013 documentary\nhttp://granadamap.com/abadia/indexsp.htm (in Spanish)\nhttp://servicios.ideal.es/guia/abadia.html (in Spanish)\nhttp://granadainfo.com/canastera/cdesacroen.htm  (on the Romani caves)\nhttp://www.sacromontegranada.com/?lang=en Museum caves of the Sacromonte's website",

        "wiki": "The Alhambra ( (listen), Spanish: [a\u02c8lamb\u027ea]; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u200e, romanized: Al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02be, pronounced [al\u0127am\u02c8ra\u02d0\u0294], lit.\u2009'\"The Red One\"') is a palace and fortress complex located in Granada, Andalusia, Spain. It was originally constructed as a small fortress in AD 889 on the remains of Roman fortifications, and then largely ignored until its ruins were renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar of the Emirate of Granada, who built its current palace and walls with many intricate details. It was converted into a royal palace in 1333 by Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada. After the conclusion of the Christian Reconquista in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where Christopher Columbus received royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered in the Renaissance style. In 1526 Charles I & V commissioned a new Renaissance palace better befitting the Holy Roman Emperor in the revolutionary Mannerist style influenced by humanist philosophy in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid Andalusian architecture, but it was ultimately never completed due to Morisco rebellions in Granada.\nAlhambra's last flowering of Islamic palaces was built for the last Muslim emirs in Spain during the decline of the Nasrid dynasty, who were increasingly subject to the Christian Kings of Castile. After being allowed to fall into disrepair for centuries, the buildings occupied by squatters, Alhambra was rediscovered following the defeat of Napoleon, who had conducted retaliatory destruction of the site. The rediscoverers were first British intellectuals and then other north European Romantic travelers. It is now one of Spain's major tourist attractions, exhibiting the country's most significant and well-known Islamic architecture, together with 16th-century and later Christian building and garden interventions. The Alhambra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Moorish poets described it as \"a pearl set in emeralds\", an allusion to the colour of its buildings and the woods around them. The palace complex was designed with the mountainous site in mind and many forms of technology were considered. The park (Alameda de la Alhambra), which is overgrown with wildflowers and grass in the spring, was planted by the Moors with roses, oranges, and myrtles; its most characteristic feature, however, is the dense wood of English elms brought by the Duke of Wellington in 1812. The park has a multitude of nightingales and is usually filled with the sound of running water from several fountains and cascades. These are supplied through a conduit 8 km (5.0 mi) long, which is connected with the Darro at the monastery of Jesus del Valle above Granada.Despite long neglect, willful vandalism, and some ill-judged restoration, the Alhambra endures as an atypical example of Muslim art in its final European stages, relatively uninfluenced by the direct Byzantine influences found in the Mezquita of C\u00f3rdoba. Most of the palace buildings are quadrangular in plan, with all the rooms opening on to a central court, and the whole reached its present size simply by the gradual addition of new quadrangles, designed on the same principle, though varying in dimensions, and connected with each other by smaller rooms and passages. Alhambra was extended by the different Muslim rulers who lived in the complex. However, each new section that was added followed the consistent theme of \"paradise on earth\". Column arcades, fountains with running water, and reflecting pools were used to add to the aesthetic and functional complexity. In every case, the exterior was left plain and austere. Sun and wind were freely admitted. Blue, red, and a golden yellow, all somewhat faded through lapse of time and exposure, are the colors chiefly employed. The name Alhambra means the red one or the red castle, which refers to the sun-dried bricks that the outer wall is made of.The decoration consists for the upper part of the walls, as a rule, of Arabic inscriptions\u2014mostly poems by Ibn Zamrak and others praising the palace\u2014that are manipulated into geometrical patterns with vegetal background set onto an arabesque setting (\"Ataurique\"). Much of this ornament is carved stucco (plaster) rather than stone. Tile mosaics (\"alicatado\"), with complicated mathematical patterns (\"tracer\u00eda\", most precisely \"lacer\u00eda\"), are largely used as panelling for the lower part. Metal was also not present very mainly. Similar designs are displayed on wooden ceilings (Alfarje). Muqarnas are the main elements for vaulting with stucco, and some of the most accomplished dome examples of this kind are in the Court of the Lions halls. The palace complex is designed in the Nasrid style, the last blooming of Islamic Art in the Iberian Peninsula, that had a great influence on the Maghreb to the present day, and on contemporary Mudejar Art, which is characteristic of western elements reinterpreted into Islamic forms and widely popular during the Reconquista in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAlhambra derives from the Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621 al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  (f.), meaning \"the red one\", the complete form of which was \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064f al-Qal\u02bbat al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  \"the red fortress (qalat)\". The \"Al-\" in \"Alhambra\" means \"the\" in Arabic, but this is ignored in general usage in both English and Spanish, where the name is normally given the definite article.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAround the year 889, forces loyal to Umar ibn Hafsun in revolt against Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi and the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba besieged a small Islamic fortress in Granada held by Saw\u0101r Ben Hamd\u016bn. The first reference to al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  came in lines of poetry attached to an arrow shot over the ramparts, recorded by Ibn Hayyan:\n\nCompleted towards the end of Muslim rule of Spain by Yusuf I (1333\u20131353) and Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada (1353\u20131391), the Alhambra is a reflection of the culture of the last centuries of the Muslim rule of Al Andalus, reduced to the Nasrid Emirate of Granada. It is a place where artists and intellectuals had taken refuge as the Reconquista by Spanish Christians won victories over Al Andalus. The Alhambra integrates natural site qualities with constructed structures and gardens, and is a testament to Moorish culture in Spain and the skills of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian artisans, craftsmen, and builders of their era.\nThe literal translation of Alhambra, \"the red (female),\" reflects the color of the red clay of the surroundings of which the fort is made. The buildings of the Alhambra were originally whitewashed; however, the buildings as seen today are reddish. Another possible origin of the name is the tribal designation of the Nasrid Dynasty, known as the Banu al-Ahmar Arabic: Sons of the Red (male), a sub-tribe of the Arab Qahtanite Banu Khazraj tribe. One of the early Nasrid ancestors was nicknamed Yusuf Al Ahmar (Yusuf the Red) and hence the (Nasrid) fraction of the Banu Khazraj took up the name of Banu al-Ahmar.\n\nThe first reference to the Qal\u2018at al-\u1e24amra was during the battles between the Arabs and the Muladies (people of mixed Arab and European descent) during the rule of the \u2018Abdullah ibn Muhammad (r. 888\u2013912). In one particularly fierce and bloody skirmish, the Muladies soundly defeated the Arabs, who were then forced to take shelter in a primitive red castle located in the province of Elvira, presently located in Granada. According to surviving documents from the era, the red castle was quite small, and its walls were not capable of deterring an army intent on conquering. The castle was then largely ignored until the eleventh century, when its ruins were renovated and rebuilt by Samuel ibn Naghrela, vizier to the emir Badis ben Habus of the Zirid Dynasty of Al Andalus, in an attempt to preserve the small Jewish settlement also located on the natural plateau, Sabikah Hill.\nIbn Nasr, the founder of the Nasrid Dynasty, was forced to flee to Ja\u00e9n to avoid persecution by King Ferdinand III of Castile and the Reconquista supporters working to end Spain's Moorish rule. After retreating to Granada, Ibn-Nasr took up residence at the Palace of Badis ben Habus in the Alhambra. A few months later, he embarked on the construction of a new Alhambra fit for the residence of a sultan. According to an Arabic manuscript since published as the An\u00f3nimo de Granada y Copenhague,\n\nThis year, 1238 Abdallah ibn al-Ahmar climbed to the place called \"the Alhambra\" inspected it, laid out the foundations of a castle and left someone in charge of its construction...\nThe design included plans for six palaces, five of which were grouped in the northeast quadrant forming a royal quarter, two circuit towers, and numerous bathhouses. During the reign of the Nasrid Dynasty, the Alhambra was transformed into a palatine city, complete with an irrigation system composed of acequias for the gardens of the Generalife located outside the fortress. Previously, the old Alhambra structure had been dependent upon rainwater collected from a cistern and from what could be brought up from the Albaic\u00edn. The creation of the Sultan's Canal solidified the identity of the Alhambra as a palace-city rather than a defensive and ascetic structure. The hydraulic system includes two long water channels and several sophisticated elevation devices to bring water onto the plateau.\n\nThe last Nasrid sultan, Muhammad XII of Granada, surrendered the Emirate of Granada in 1492 without the Alhambra itself being attacked when the forces of the Reyes Cat\u00f3licos, King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, took the surrounding territory with a force of overwhelming numbers.\nThe decoration within the palaces comes from the last great period of Andalusian art in Granada. With little of the Byzantine influence of contemporary Abassid architecture, artists endlessly reproduced the same forms and trends, creating a new style that developed over the course of the Nasrid Dynasty. The Nasrids used freely all the stylistic elements that had been created and developed during eight centuries of Muslim rule in the Peninsula, including the Caliphate horseshoe arch, the Almohad sebka (a grid of rhombuses), the Almoravid palm, and unique combinations of them, as well as innovations such as stilted arches and muqarnas (stalactite ceiling decorations). Structurally, the design is simple and does not evince significant innovation. While artistically pleasing it was until the reconquest structurally ad hoc and reliant on the skills of subject artisans and workers.\nColumns and muqarnas appear in several chambers, and the interiors of numerous palaces are decorated with arabesques and calligraphy. The arabesques of the interior are ascribed to, among other sultans, Yusuf I, Mohammed V, and Ismail I, Sultan of Granada.\n\nAfter the Christian conquest of the city in 1492, the conquerors began to alter the Alhambra. The open work was filled up with whitewash, the painting and gilding effaced, and the furniture soiled, torn, or removed. Charles I (1516\u20131556) rebuilt portions in the Renaissance style of the period and destroyed the greater part of the winter palace to make room for a Renaissance-style structure which was never completed. Philip V (1700\u20131746) Italianised the rooms and completed his palace in the middle of what had been the Moorish building; he had partitions constructed which blocked up whole apartments.Over subsequent centuries the Moorish art was further damaged, and in 1812 some of the towers were destroyed by the French under Count Sebastiani. In 1821, an earthquake caused further damage. Restoration work was undertaken in 1828 by the architect Jos\u00e9 Contreras, endowed in 1830 by Ferdinand VII. After the death of Contreras in 1847, it was continued by his son Rafael (died 1890) and his grandson. Especially notable was the intervention of Leopoldo Torres Balb\u00e1s in the 1930s: the young architect \"opened arcades that had been walled up, re-excavated filled-in pools, replaced missing tiles, completed inscriptions that lacked portions of their stuccoed lettering, and installed a ceiling in the still unfinished palace of Charles V\".\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nAccording to the site's current architect, Pedro Salmeron Escobar, the Alhambra evolved organically over a period of several centuries from the ancient hilltop fortress defined by a narrow promontory carved by the river Darro and overlooking the Vega or Plain of Granada as it descends from the Sierra Nevada. The red earth from which the fortress is constructed is a granular aggregate held together by a medium of red clay which gives the resulting layered brick- and stone- reinforced construction (tapial calicastrado) its characteristic hue and is at the root of the name of 'the Red Hill'.This crude earthiness is counterpointed by the startling fine alabaster white stucco work of the famous interiors. Meltwater from the 'Snowy Mountains' is drawn across an arched vault at the eastern tip of the Torre del Agua ('Water Tower') and channeled through the citadel via a complex system of conduits (acequia) and water tanks (los albercones) which create the celebrated interplay of light, sound and surface.Alhambra is about 740 metres (2,430 ft) in length by 205 metres (670 ft) at its greatest width. It extends from west-northwest to east-southeast and covers an area of about 142,000 square metres (1,530,000 sq ft) or 35 acres. The Alhambra's most westerly feature is the Alcazaba (citadel), a strongly fortified position built to protect the original post-Roman districts of Iliberri, now 'Centro', and G\u00e1rnata al-yah\u016bd ('Granada of the Jews', now Realejo, and the Moorish suburb of El Albayz\u00edn.\n\nDue to touristic demand, modern access runs contrary to the original sequence which began from a principal access via the Puerta de la Justicia (Gate of Justice) onto a large souq or public market square facing the Alcazaba, now subdivided and obscured by later Christian-era development. From the Puerta del Vino (Wine Gate) ran the Calle Real (Royal Street) dividing the Alhambra along its axial spine into a southern residential quarter, with mosques, hamams (bathhouses) and diverse functional establishments, and a greater northern portion, occupied by several palaces of the nobility with extensive landscaped gardens commanding views over the Albayzin. All of this was subservient to the great Tower of the Ambassadors in the Palacio Comares, which acted as the royal audience chamber and throne room with its three arched windows dominating the city. The private, internalised universe of the Palacio de Los Leones (Palace of the Lions) adjoins the public spaces at right angles (see Plan illustration) but was originally connected only by the function of the Royal Baths, the Eye of Aixa's Room serving as the exquisitely decorated focus of meditation and authority overlooking the refined garden of Lindaraja/Daraxa toward the city.The rest of the plateau comprises a number of earlier and later Moorish palaces, enclosed by a fortified wall, with thirteen defensive towers, some such as the Torres de la Infanta and Cattiva containing elaborate vertical palaces in miniature. The river Darro passes through a ravine on the north and divides the plateau from the Albaic\u00edn district of Granada. Similarly, the Assabica Valley, containing the Alhambra Park, lies on the west and south, and, beyond this valley, the almost parallel ridge of Monte Mauror separates it from the Antequeruela district. Another ravine separates it from the Generalife, the summer pleasure gardens of the emir. Escobar notes that the later planting of deciduous elms obscures the overall perception of the layout, so a better reading of the original landscape is given in winter when the trees are bare.\n\n\n== Main structures ==\n\nThe Alhambra resembles many medieval Christian strongholds in its threefold arrangement as a castle, a palace and a residential annex for subordinates. The alcazaba or citadel, its oldest part, is built on the isolated and precipitous foreland which terminates the plateau on the northwest. All that remains are its massive outer walls, towers and ramparts. On its watchtower, the 25 m (85 ft) high Torre de la Vela, the flag of Ferdinand and Isabella was first raised as a symbol of the Spanish conquest of Granada on 2 January 1492. A turret containing a large bell was added in the 18th century and restored after being damaged by lightning in 1881. Beyond the Alcazaba is the palace of the Moorish rulers, The Nasrid Palaces or Alhambra proper, and beyond this is the Alhambra Alta (Upper Alhambra), originally occupied by officials and courtiers.\nAccess from the city to the Alhambra Park is afforded by the Puerta de las Granadas (Gate of Pomegranates), a triumphal arch dating from the 15th century. A steep ascent leads past the Pillar of Charles V, a fountain erected in 1554, to the main entrance of the Alhambra. This is the Puerta de la Justicia (Gate of Justice), a massive horseshoe archway surmounted by a square tower and used by the Moors as an informal court of justice. The hand of Fatima, with fingers outstretched as a talisman against the evil eye, is carved above this gate on the exterior; a key, the symbol of authority, occupies the corresponding place on the interior. A narrow passage leads inward to the Plaza de los Aljibes (Place of the Cisterns), a broad open space which divides the Alcazaba from the Moorish palace. To the left of the passage rises the Torre del Vino (Wine Tower), built in 1345 and used in the 16th century as a cellar. On the right is the palace of Charles V, a smaller Renaissance building, to construct which part of the Alhambra, including the original main entrance, was torn down.\n\n\n=== Royal complex ===\n\nThe Royal Complex (Plaza de Nazar\u00edes) consists of three main parts: Mexuar, Serallo, and the Harem. The Mexuar is modest in decor and houses the functional areas for conducting business and administration. Strapwork is used to decorate the surfaces in Mexuar. The ceilings, floors, and trim are made of dark wood and are in sharp contrast to white, plaster walls. Serallo, built during the reign of Yusuf I in the 14th century, contains the Patio de los Arrayanes (Court of the Myrtles). Brightly colored interiors featured dado panels, yeser\u00eda, azulejo, cedar, and artesonado. Artesonado are highly decorative ceilings and other woodwork. Lastly, the Harem is also elaborately decorated and contains the living quarters for the wives and mistresses of the Arab monarchs. This area contains a bathroom with running water (cold and hot), baths, and pressurized water for showering. The bathrooms were open to the elements in order to allow in light and air.\n\n\n=== Court of the Myrtles ===\n\nThe present entrance to the Palacio \u00c1rabe (Arab palace), or Casa Real, is by a small door from which a corridor connects to the Patio de los Arrayanes (Court of the Myrtles), also called the Patio de la Alberca (Court of the Blessing or Court of the Pond), from the Arabic birka, \"pool\". The birka helped to cool the palace and acted as a symbol of power. Because water was usually in short supply, the technology required to keep these pools full was expensive and difficult. This court is 42 m (140 ft) long by 22 m (74 ft) broad, and in the centre there is a large pond set in the marble pavement, full of goldfish, and with myrtles growing along its sides. There are galleries on the north and south sides; the southern gallery is 7 m (23 ft) high and supported by a marble colonnade. Underneath it, to the right, was the principal entrance, and over it are three windows with arches and miniature pillars. From this court, the walls of the Torre de Comares are seen rising over the roof to the north and reflected in the pond.\n\n\n=== Hall of the Ambassadors ===\n\nThe Sal\u00f3n de los Embajadores (Hall of the Ambassadors) is the largest room in the Alhambra and occupies all the Torre de Comares. It is a square room, the sides being 12 m (37 ft) in length, while the centre of the dome is 23 m (75 ft) high. This was the grand reception room, and the throne of the sultan was placed opposite the entrance. The grand hall projects from the walls of the palace, providing views in three directions. In this sense, it was a \"mirador\" from which the palace's inhabitants could gaze outward to the surrounding landscape.  The tiles are nearly 4 ft (1.2 m) high all round, and the colours vary at intervals. Over them is a series of oval medallions with inscriptions, interwoven with flowers and leaves. There are nine windows, three on each facade, and the ceiling is decorated with white, blue and gold inlays in the shape of circles, crowns and stars. The walls are covered with varied stucco works, surrounding many ancient escutcheons.\n\n\n=== Court of the Lions and fountain ===\n\nThe Court of the Lions (Patio de los Leones) is an oblong courtyard, 116 ft (35 m) in length by 66 ft (20 m) in width, surrounded by a low gallery supported on 124 white marble columns. A pavilion projects into the court at each extremity, with filigree walls and a light domed roof. The square is paved with coloured tiles and the colonnade with white marble, while the walls are covered 5 ft (1.5 m) up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles, with a border above and below of enamelled blue and gold. The columns supporting the roof and gallery are irregularly placed. They are adorned by varieties of foliage, etc.; about each arch there is a large square of stucco arabesques; and over the pillars is another stucco square of filigree work.\n\n\n==== Fountain of the Lions ====\nIn the centre of the court is the Fountain of the Lions, an alabaster basin supported by the figures of twelve lions in white marble, not designed with sculptural accuracy but as symbols of strength, power, and sovereignty. Each hour one lion would produce water from its mouth. At the edge of the great fountain there is a poem written by Ibn Zamrak. This praises the beauty of the fountain and the power of the lions, but it also describes their ingenious hydraulic systems and how they actually worked, which baffled all those who saw them.\n\n\n=== Hall of the Abencerrajes ===\n\nThe Sala de los Abencerrajes (Hall of the Abencerrages) derives its name from a legend according to which the father of Boabdil, the last sultan of Granada, having invited the chiefs of that line to a banquet, massacred them here. This room is a perfect square, with a lofty dome and trellised windows at its base. The roof is decorated in blue, brown, red and gold, and the columns supporting it spring out into the arch form in a remarkably beautiful manner. Opposite to this hall is the Sala de las dos Hermanas (Hall of the two Sisters), so-called from two white marble slabs laid as part of the pavement. These slabs measure 500 by 220 cm (15 by 7\u00bd ft). There is a fountain in the middle of this hall, and the roof \u2013 a dome honeycombed with tiny cells, all different, and said to number 5000 \u2013 is an example of the \"stalactite vaulting\" of the Moors.\n\n\n=== Generalife ===\n\nOf the outlying buildings connected to the Alhambra, the foremost in interest is the Palacio de Generalife or Gineralife (the Muslim Jennat al Arif, \"Garden of Arif,\" or \"Garden of the Architect\"). This villa dates from the beginning of the 14th century but has been restored several times. The Villa de los Martires (Martyrs' Villa), on the summit of Monte Mauror, commemorates by its name the Christian slaves who were forced to build the Alhambra and confined here in subterranean cells. The Torres Bermejas (Vermilion Towers), also on Monte Mauror, are a well-preserved Moorish fortification, with underground cisterns, stables, and accommodation for a garrison of 200 men. Several Roman tombs were discovered in 1829 and 1857 at the base of Monte Mauror.\n\n\n=== Other features ===\nAmong the other features of the Alhambra are the Sala de la Justicia (Hall of Justice), the Patio del Mexuar (Court of the Council Chamber), the Patio de Daraxa (Court of the Vestibule), and the Peinador de la Reina (Queen's Robing Room), in which there is similar architecture and decoration. The palace and the Upper Alhambra also contain baths, rows of bedrooms and summer-rooms, a whispering gallery and labyrinth, and vaulted sepulchres.\nThe original furniture of the palace is represented by one of the famous Alhambra vases, very large Hispano-Moresque ware vases made in the Sultanate to stand in niches around the palace. These famous examples of Hispano-Moresque ware date from the 14th and 15th centuries. The one remaining in the palace, from about 1400, is 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) high; the background is white and the decoration is blue, white and gold.\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\n\n=== In literature ===\n\nParts of the following works are set in the Alhambra:\n\nWashington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra. This is a collection of essays, verbal sketches, and stories. Irving lived in the palace while writing the book and was instrumental in introducing the site to Western audiences.\nSalman Rushdie's The Moor's Last Sigh\nAmin Maalouf's Leo Africanus, depicting the reconquest of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs.\nPhilippa Gregory's The Constant Princess, depicting Catalina the Infanta of Spain as she lived in the Alhambra after her parents took Granada.\nFederico Garc\u00eda Lorca's play Do\u00f1a Rosita the Spinster, mentioned by title character Do\u00f1a Rosita in her song/speech to the Manola sisters.\nPaulo Coelho's novel The Alchemist\nAli Smith's The Accidental\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's play Man and Superman\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai's Seiobo There Below\nHanya Yanagihara's A Little Life\n\n\n=== In music ===\nThe plot of the Ballet-h\u00e9ro\u00efque entitled Za\u00efde, Reine De Grenade, by the French Baroque composer Joseph-Nicolas-Pancrace Royer (c. 1705\u20131755), takes place at the Alhambra. Alhambra has directly inspired musical compositions as Francisco T\u00e1rrega's famous tremolo study for guitar Recuerdos De La Alhambra. Claude Debussy's piece for two pianos composed in 1901, Lindaraja, and the prelude, La Puerta Del Vino, from the second book of preludes composed from 1912 to 1913. Isaac Alb\u00e9niz wrote a piano suite Recuerdos De viaje, which included a piece called \"En La Alhambra\", while his suite Iberia contained a piece called \"El Albacin\". Alb\u00e9niz also composed an uncompleted Suite Alhambra.\n\n\"En Los Jardines Del Generalife\", the first movement of Manuel de Falla's Noches En Los Jardines De Espa\u00f1a, and other pieces by composers such as Ruperto Chap\u00ed (Los Gnomos De La Alhambra, 1891), Tom\u00e1s Bret\u00f3n, and many others are included in a stream referred to by scholars as Alhambrismo.In 1976, filmmaker Christopher Nupen filmed The Song of the Guitar at the Alhambra which was an hour-long program featuring the legendary Spanish guitarist, Andr\u00e9s Segovia.\nBritish composer Peter Seabourne wrote an extended piano cycle Steps Volume 3: Arabesques (2008-2012) based on shared experiences of the Alhambra with his painter aunt Ann Seabourne, and a movement from his Steps Volume 1 is entitled \"El Suspiro del Moro\" inspired by the legend of the expulsion of the last Moorish King of Granada. Julian Anderson wrote an orchestral piece, Alhambra Fantasy.\nIn pop and folk music, Alhambra is the subject of the Ghymes song of the same name. The rock band Grateful Dead released a song called \"Terrapin Station\" on the 1977 album of the same name. It consisted of a series of small compositions penned by Robert Hunter and put to music by Jerry Garcia; a lyrical section of this suite was called \"Alhambra\". In September 2006, Canadian singer/composer Loreena McKennitt performed live at the Alhambra. The resulting video recordings premiered on PBS and were later released as a 3-disc DVD/CD set called Nights from the Alhambra. The Basque pop group Mocedades performed a song called \"Juntos En La Alhambra\". Alhambra is the title of an EP recording by Canadian rock band, The Tea Party, containing acoustic versions of a few of their songs. Alhambra and Albaic\u00edn are mentioned in the M\u00e4go de Oz song named \"El Paseo De Los Tristes\" from the album entitled Gaia II. On California rapper Dom Kennedy's 2015 album By Dom Kennedy, there is a song entitled \"Alhambra\".\n\n\n=== In mathematics ===\n\nThe Alhambra tiles are remarkable in that they contain nearly all, if not all, of the seventeen mathematically possible wallpaper groups. This is a unique accomplishment in world architecture. M. C. Escher's visit in 1922 and study of the Moorish use of symmetries in the Alhambra tiles inspired his subsequent work on tessellation, which he called \"regular divisions of the plane\".\n\n\n=== In film ===\nMarcel L'Herbier's 1921 film El Dorado features many scenes shot in and around the Alhambra palace. This was the first time permission had been granted for a feature film company to shoot inside the Alhambra palace and L'Herbier gave prominent place to its gardens, fountains and geometric architectural patterns, which became some of the film's most memorable images.\nAnimated films by Spanish director Juan Bautista Berasategui such as Ahmed, El Principe De La Alhambra and El Embrujo Del Sur are based on stories in Washington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra.\nColumbus interview with Queen Isabella in Conquest of Paradise representing Granada after the Reconquest were filmed at Alhambra. As well as the Palace Scenes of Kingdom of Heaven representing Jerusalem during the Cruzades. Both films were made by Ridley Scott.\nThe Court of the Lions was depicted in Assassin's Creed (2016) when Sultan Muhammad XII surrenders the 'Apple of Eden', a powerful artifact in the center of the movie plot, in exchange for his son's safe return. Both the Court of the Lions and Granada's Albaicin are featured on The animated film Tad Jones: The Hero Returns.The fictional Broadway theatre (the interior actually Auckland, New Zealand's Civic Theatre), in which Kong is displayed as the 'Eighth Wonder of the World' in 2005's King Kong, is named \"The Alhambra\".2018 South Korean television series Memories of the Alhambra is based in Granada, Spain. The CEO of an investment company that specializes in optical devices, travels to Granada, Spain to meet the creator of the game. He gets entangled in a mysterious incident, and the border between the real world and the AR world begins to blur.\n\n\n=== In board games ===\nDirk Henn's game Der Palast von Alhambra, literally \"The Palace of the Alhambra\". Players compete to get funds and pay contractors to build the best palace complex. It was published by Queen Games with numerous expansion packs. It won the Spiel des Jahres award in 2003.\n\n\n=== In astronomy ===\nThere is a main belt asteroid named Alhambra.\n\n\n=== In architecture ===\nThe Alhambra inspired:\n\nthe synagogue Isaac M.

        "wiki": "The Alhambra ( (listen), Spanish: [a\u02c8lamb\u027ea]; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u200e, romanized: Al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02be, pronounced [al\u0127am\u02c8ra\u02d0\u0294], lit.\u2009'\"The Red One\"') is a palace and fortress complex located in Granada, Andalusia, Spain. It was originally constructed as a small fortress in AD 889 on the remains of Roman fortifications, and then largely ignored until its ruins were renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar of the Emirate of Granada, who built its current palace and walls with many intricate details. It was converted into a royal palace in 1333 by Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada. After the conclusion of the Christian Reconquista in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where Christopher Columbus received royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered in the Renaissance style. In 1526 Charles I & V commissioned a new Renaissance palace better befitting the Holy Roman Emperor in the revolutionary Mannerist style influenced by humanist philosophy in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid Andalusian architecture, but it was ultimately never completed due to Morisco rebellions in Granada.\nAlhambra's last flowering of Islamic palaces was built for the last Muslim emirs in Spain during the decline of the Nasrid dynasty, who were increasingly subject to the Christian Kings of Castile. After being allowed to fall into disrepair for centuries, the buildings occupied by squatters, Alhambra was rediscovered following the defeat of Napoleon, who had conducted retaliatory destruction of the site. The rediscoverers were first British intellectuals and then other north European Romantic travelers. It is now one of Spain's major tourist attractions, exhibiting the country's most significant and well-known Islamic architecture, together with 16th-century and later Christian building and garden interventions. The Alhambra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Moorish poets described it as \"a pearl set in emeralds\", an allusion to the colour of its buildings and the woods around them. The palace complex was designed with the mountainous site in mind and many forms of technology were considered. The park (Alameda de la Alhambra), which is overgrown with wildflowers and grass in the spring, was planted by the Moors with roses, oranges, and myrtles; its most characteristic feature, however, is the dense wood of English elms brought by the Duke of Wellington in 1812. The park has a multitude of nightingales and is usually filled with the sound of running water from several fountains and cascades. These are supplied through a conduit 8 km (5.0 mi) long, which is connected with the Darro at the monastery of Jesus del Valle above Granada.Despite long neglect, willful vandalism, and some ill-judged restoration, the Alhambra endures as an atypical example of Muslim art in its final European stages, relatively uninfluenced by the direct Byzantine influences found in the Mezquita of C\u00f3rdoba. Most of the palace buildings are quadrangular in plan, with all the rooms opening on to a central court, and the whole reached its present size simply by the gradual addition of new quadrangles, designed on the same principle, though varying in dimensions, and connected with each other by smaller rooms and passages. Alhambra was extended by the different Muslim rulers who lived in the complex. However, each new section that was added followed the consistent theme of \"paradise on earth\". Column arcades, fountains with running water, and reflecting pools were used to add to the aesthetic and functional complexity. In every case, the exterior was left plain and austere. Sun and wind were freely admitted. Blue, red, and a golden yellow, all somewhat faded through lapse of time and exposure, are the colors chiefly employed. The name Alhambra means the red one or the red castle, which refers to the sun-dried bricks that the outer wall is made of.The decoration consists for the upper part of the walls, as a rule, of Arabic inscriptions\u2014mostly poems by Ibn Zamrak and others praising the palace\u2014that are manipulated into geometrical patterns with vegetal background set onto an arabesque setting (\"Ataurique\"). Much of this ornament is carved stucco (plaster) rather than stone. Tile mosaics (\"alicatado\"), with complicated mathematical patterns (\"tracer\u00eda\", most precisely \"lacer\u00eda\"), are largely used as panelling for the lower part. Metal was also not present very mainly. Similar designs are displayed on wooden ceilings (Alfarje). Muqarnas are the main elements for vaulting with stucco, and some of the most accomplished dome examples of this kind are in the Court of the Lions halls. The palace complex is designed in the Nasrid style, the last blooming of Islamic Art in the Iberian Peninsula, that had a great influence on the Maghreb to the present day, and on contemporary Mudejar Art, which is characteristic of western elements reinterpreted into Islamic forms and widely popular during the Reconquista in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAlhambra derives from the Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621 al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  (f.), meaning \"the red one\", the complete form of which was \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064f al-Qal\u02bbat al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  \"the red fortress (qalat)\". The \"Al-\" in \"Alhambra\" means \"the\" in Arabic, but this is ignored in general usage in both English and Spanish, where the name is normally given the definite article.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAround the year 889, forces loyal to Umar ibn Hafsun in revolt against Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi and the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba besieged a small Islamic fortress in Granada held by Saw\u0101r Ben Hamd\u016bn. The first reference to al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  came in lines of poetry attached to an arrow shot over the ramparts, recorded by Ibn Hayyan:\n\nCompleted towards the end of Muslim rule of Spain by Yusuf I (1333\u20131353) and Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada (1353\u20131391), the Alhambra is a reflection of the culture of the last centuries of the Muslim rule of Al Andalus, reduced to the Nasrid Emirate of Granada. It is a place where artists and intellectuals had taken refuge as the Reconquista by Spanish Christians won victories over Al Andalus. The Alhambra integrates natural site qualities with constructed structures and gardens, and is a testament to Moorish culture in Spain and the skills of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian artisans, craftsmen, and builders of their era.\nThe literal translation of Alhambra, \"the red (female),\" reflects the color of the red clay of the surroundings of which the fort is made. The buildings of the Alhambra were originally whitewashed; however, the buildings as seen today are reddish. Another possible origin of the name is the tribal designation of the Nasrid Dynasty, known as the Banu al-Ahmar Arabic: Sons of the Red (male), a sub-tribe of the Arab Qahtanite Banu Khazraj tribe. One of the early Nasrid ancestors was nicknamed Yusuf Al Ahmar (Yusuf the Red) and hence the (Nasrid) fraction of the Banu Khazraj took up the name of Banu al-Ahmar.\n\nThe first reference to the Qal\u2018at al-\u1e24amra was during the battles between the Arabs and the Muladies (people of mixed Arab and European descent) during the rule of the \u2018Abdullah ibn Muhammad (r. 888\u2013912). In one particularly fierce and bloody skirmish, the Muladies soundly defeated the Arabs, who were then forced to take shelter in a primitive red castle located in the province of Elvira, presently located in Granada. According to surviving documents from the era, the red castle was quite small, and its walls were not capable of deterring an army intent on conquering. The castle was then largely ignored until the eleventh century, when its ruins were renovated and rebuilt by Samuel ibn Naghrela, vizier to the emir Badis ben Habus of the Zirid Dynasty of Al Andalus, in an attempt to preserve the small Jewish settlement also located on the natural plateau, Sabikah Hill.\nIbn Nasr, the founder of the Nasrid Dynasty, was forced to flee to Ja\u00e9n to avoid persecution by King Ferdinand III of Castile and the Reconquista supporters working to end Spain's Moorish rule. After retreating to Granada, Ibn-Nasr took up residence at the Palace of Badis ben Habus in the Alhambra. A few months later, he embarked on the construction of a new Alhambra fit for the residence of a sultan. According to an Arabic manuscript since published as the An\u00f3nimo de Granada y Copenhague,\n\nThis year, 1238 Abdallah ibn al-Ahmar climbed to the place called \"the Alhambra\" inspected it, laid out the foundations of a castle and left someone in charge of its construction...\nThe design included plans for six palaces, five of which were grouped in the northeast quadrant forming a royal quarter, two circuit towers, and numerous bathhouses. During the reign of the Nasrid Dynasty, the Alhambra was transformed into a palatine city, complete with an irrigation system composed of acequias for the gardens of the Generalife located outside the fortress. Previously, the old Alhambra structure had been dependent upon rainwater collected from a cistern and from what could be brought up from the Albaic\u00edn. The creation of the Sultan's Canal solidified the identity of the Alhambra as a palace-city rather than a defensive and ascetic structure. The hydraulic system includes two long water channels and several sophisticated elevation devices to bring water onto the plateau.\n\nThe last Nasrid sultan, Muhammad XII of Granada, surrendered the Emirate of Granada in 1492 without the Alhambra itself being attacked when the forces of the Reyes Cat\u00f3licos, King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, took the surrounding territory with a force of overwhelming numbers.\nThe decoration within the palaces comes from the last great period of Andalusian art in Granada. With little of the Byzantine influence of contemporary Abassid architecture, artists endlessly reproduced the same forms and trends, creating a new style that developed over the course of the Nasrid Dynasty. The Nasrids used freely all the stylistic elements that had been created and developed during eight centuries of Muslim rule in the Peninsula, including the Caliphate horseshoe arch, the Almohad sebka (a grid of rhombuses), the Almoravid palm, and unique combinations of them, as well as innovations such as stilted arches and muqarnas (stalactite ceiling decorations). Structurally, the design is simple and does not evince significant innovation. While artistically pleasing it was until the reconquest structurally ad hoc and reliant on the skills of subject artisans and workers.\nColumns and muqarnas appear in several chambers, and the interiors of numerous palaces are decorated with arabesques and calligraphy. The arabesques of the interior are ascribed to, among other sultans, Yusuf I, Mohammed V, and Ismail I, Sultan of Granada.\n\nAfter the Christian conquest of the city in 1492, the conquerors began to alter the Alhambra. The open work was filled up with whitewash, the painting and gilding effaced, and the furniture soiled, torn, or removed. Charles I (1516\u20131556) rebuilt portions in the Renaissance style of the period and destroyed the greater part of the winter palace to make room for a Renaissance-style structure which was never completed. Philip V (1700\u20131746) Italianised the rooms and completed his palace in the middle of what had been the Moorish building; he had partitions constructed which blocked up whole apartments.Over subsequent centuries the Moorish art was further damaged, and in 1812 some of the towers were destroyed by the French under Count Sebastiani. In 1821, an earthquake caused further damage. Restoration work was undertaken in 1828 by the architect Jos\u00e9 Contreras, endowed in 1830 by Ferdinand VII. After the death of Contreras in 1847, it was continued by his son Rafael (died 1890) and his grandson. Especially notable was the intervention of Leopoldo Torres Balb\u00e1s in the 1930s: the young architect \"opened arcades that had been walled up, re-excavated filled-in pools, replaced missing tiles, completed inscriptions that lacked portions of their stuccoed lettering, and installed a ceiling in the still unfinished palace of Charles V\".\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nAccording to the site's current architect, Pedro Salmeron Escobar, the Alhambra evolved organically over a period of several centuries from the ancient hilltop fortress defined by a narrow promontory carved by the river Darro and overlooking the Vega or Plain of Granada as it descends from the Sierra Nevada. The red earth from which the fortress is constructed is a granular aggregate held together by a medium of red clay which gives the resulting layered brick- and stone- reinforced construction (tapial calicastrado) its characteristic hue and is at the root of the name of 'the Red Hill'.This crude earthiness is counterpointed by the startling fine alabaster white stucco work of the famous interiors. Meltwater from the 'Snowy Mountains' is drawn across an arched vault at the eastern tip of the Torre del Agua ('Water Tower') and channeled through the citadel via a complex system of conduits (acequia) and water tanks (los albercones) which create the celebrated interplay of light, sound and surface.Alhambra is about 740 metres (2,430 ft) in length by 205 metres (670 ft) at its greatest width. It extends from west-northwest to east-southeast and covers an area of about 142,000 square metres (1,530,000 sq ft) or 35 acres. The Alhambra's most westerly feature is the Alcazaba (citadel), a strongly fortified position built to protect the original post-Roman districts of Iliberri, now 'Centro', and G\u00e1rnata al-yah\u016bd ('Granada of the Jews', now Realejo, and the Moorish suburb of El Albayz\u00edn.\n\nDue to touristic demand, modern access runs contrary to the original sequence which began from a principal access via the Puerta de la Justicia (Gate of Justice) onto a large souq or public market square facing the Alcazaba, now subdivided and obscured by later Christian-era development. From the Puerta del Vino (Wine Gate) ran the Calle Real (Royal Street) dividing the Alhambra along its axial spine into a southern residential quarter, with mosques, hamams (bathhouses) and diverse functional establishments, and a greater northern portion, occupied by several palaces of the nobility with extensive landscaped gardens commanding views over the Albayzin. All of this was subservient to the great Tower of the Ambassadors in the Palacio Comares, which acted as the royal audience chamber and throne room with its three arched windows dominating the city. The private, internalised universe of the Palacio de Los Leones (Palace of the Lions) adjoins the public spaces at right angles (see Plan illustration) but was originally connected only by the function of the Royal Baths, the Eye of Aixa's Room serving as the exquisitely decorated focus of meditation and authority overlooking the refined garden of Lindaraja/Daraxa toward the city.The rest of the plateau comprises a number of earlier and later Moorish palaces, enclosed by a fortified wall, with thirteen defensive towers, some such as the Torres de la Infanta and Cattiva containing elaborate vertical palaces in miniature. The river Darro passes through a ravine on the north and divides the plateau from the Albaic\u00edn district of Granada. Similarly, the Assabica Valley, containing the Alhambra Park, lies on the west and south, and, beyond this valley, the almost parallel ridge of Monte Mauror separates it from the Antequeruela district. Another ravine separates it from the Generalife, the summer pleasure gardens of the emir. Escobar notes that the later planting of deciduous elms obscures the overall perception of the layout, so a better reading of the original landscape is given in winter when the trees are bare.\n\n\n== Main structures ==\n\nThe Alhambra resembles many medieval Christian strongholds in its threefold arrangement as a castle, a palace and a residential annex for subordinates. The alcazaba or citadel, its oldest part, is built on the isolated and precipitous foreland which terminates the plateau on the northwest. All that remains are its massive outer walls, towers and ramparts. On its watchtower, the 25 m (85 ft) high Torre de la Vela, the flag of Ferdinand and Isabella was first raised as a symbol of the Spanish conquest of Granada on 2 January 1492. A turret containing a large bell was added in the 18th century and restored after being damaged by lightning in 1881. Beyond the Alcazaba is the palace of the Moorish rulers, The Nasrid Palaces or Alhambra proper, and beyond this is the Alhambra Alta (Upper Alhambra), originally occupied by officials and courtiers.\nAccess from the city to the Alhambra Park is afforded by the Puerta de las Granadas (Gate of Pomegranates), a triumphal arch dating from the 15th century. A steep ascent leads past the Pillar of Charles V, a fountain erected in 1554, to the main entrance of the Alhambra. This is the Puerta de la Justicia (Gate of Justice), a massive horseshoe archway surmounted by a square tower and used by the Moors as an informal court of justice. The hand of Fatima, with fingers outstretched as a talisman against the evil eye, is carved above this gate on the exterior; a key, the symbol of authority, occupies the corresponding place on the interior. A narrow passage leads inward to the Plaza de los Aljibes (Place of the Cisterns), a broad open space which divides the Alcazaba from the Moorish palace. To the left of the passage rises the Torre del Vino (Wine Tower), built in 1345 and used in the 16th century as a cellar. On the right is the palace of Charles V, a smaller Renaissance building, to construct which part of the Alhambra, including the original main entrance, was torn down.\n\n\n=== Royal complex ===\n\nThe Royal Complex (Plaza de Nazar\u00edes) consists of three main parts: Mexuar, Serallo, and the Harem. The Mexuar is modest in decor and houses the functional areas for conducting business and administration. Strapwork is used to decorate the surfaces in Mexuar. The ceilings, floors, and trim are made of dark wood and are in sharp contrast to white, plaster walls. Serallo, built during the reign of Yusuf I in the 14th century, contains the Patio de los Arrayanes (Court of the Myrtles). Brightly colored interiors featured dado panels, yeser\u00eda, azulejo, cedar, and artesonado. Artesonado are highly decorative ceilings and other woodwork. Lastly, the Harem is also elaborately decorated and contains the living quarters for the wives and mistresses of the Arab monarchs. This area contains a bathroom with running water (cold and hot), baths, and pressurized water for showering. The bathrooms were open to the elements in order to allow in light and air.\n\n\n=== Court of the Myrtles ===\n\nThe present entrance to the Palacio \u00c1rabe (Arab palace), or Casa Real, is by a small door from which a corridor connects to the Patio de los Arrayanes (Court of the Myrtles), also called the Patio de la Alberca (Court of the Blessing or Court of the Pond), from the Arabic birka, \"pool\". The birka helped to cool the palace and acted as a symbol of power. Because water was usually in short supply, the technology required to keep these pools full was expensive and difficult. This court is 42 m (140 ft) long by 22 m (74 ft) broad, and in the centre there is a large pond set in the marble pavement, full of goldfish, and with myrtles growing along its sides. There are galleries on the north and south sides; the southern gallery is 7 m (23 ft) high and supported by a marble colonnade. Underneath it, to the right, was the principal entrance, and over it are three windows with arches and miniature pillars. From this court, the walls of the Torre de Comares are seen rising over the roof to the north and reflected in the pond.\n\n\n=== Hall of the Ambassadors ===\n\nThe Sal\u00f3n de los Embajadores (Hall of the Ambassadors) is the largest room in the Alhambra and occupies all the Torre de Comares. It is a square room, the sides being 12 m (37 ft) in length, while the centre of the dome is 23 m (75 ft) high. This was the grand reception room, and the throne of the sultan was placed opposite the entrance. The grand hall projects from the walls of the palace, providing views in three directions. In this sense, it was a \"mirador\" from which the palace's inhabitants could gaze outward to the surrounding landscape.  The tiles are nearly 4 ft (1.2 m) high all round, and the colours vary at intervals. Over them is a series of oval medallions with inscriptions, interwoven with flowers and leaves. There are nine windows, three on each facade, and the ceiling is decorated with white, blue and gold inlays in the shape of circles, crowns and stars. The walls are covered with varied stucco works, surrounding many ancient escutcheons.\n\n\n=== Court of the Lions and fountain ===\n\nThe Court of the Lions (Patio de los Leones) is an oblong courtyard, 116 ft (35 m) in length by 66 ft (20 m) in width, surrounded by a low gallery supported on 124 white marble columns. A pavilion projects into the court at each extremity, with filigree walls and a light domed roof. The square is paved with coloured tiles and the colonnade with white marble, while the walls are covered 5 ft (1.5 m) up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles, with a border above and below of enamelled blue and gold. The columns supporting the roof and gallery are irregularly placed. They are adorned by varieties of foliage, etc.; about each arch there is a large square of stucco arabesques; and over the pillars is another stucco square of filigree work.\n\n\n==== Fountain of the Lions ====\nIn the centre of the court is the Fountain of the Lions, an alabaster basin supported by the figures of twelve lions in white marble, not designed with sculptural accuracy but as symbols of strength, power, and sovereignty. Each hour one lion would produce water from its mouth. At the edge of the great fountain there is a poem written by Ibn Zamrak. This praises the beauty of the fountain and the power of the lions, but it also describes their ingenious hydraulic systems and how they actually worked, which baffled all those who saw them.\n\n\n=== Hall of the Abencerrajes ===\n\nThe Sala de los Abencerrajes (Hall of the Abencerrages) derives its name from a legend according to which the father of Boabdil, the last sultan of Granada, having invited the chiefs of that line to a banquet, massacred them here. This room is a perfect square, with a lofty dome and trellised windows at its base. The roof is decorated in blue, brown, red and gold, and the columns supporting it spring out into the arch form in a remarkably beautiful manner. Opposite to this hall is the Sala de las dos Hermanas (Hall of the two Sisters), so-called from two white marble slabs laid as part of the pavement. These slabs measure 500 by 220 cm (15 by 7\u00bd ft). There is a fountain in the middle of this hall, and the roof \u2013 a dome honeycombed with tiny cells, all different, and said to number 5000 \u2013 is an example of the \"stalactite vaulting\" of the Moors.\n\n\n=== Generalife ===\n\nOf the outlying buildings connected to the Alhambra, the foremost in interest is the Palacio de Generalife or Gineralife (the Muslim Jennat al Arif, \"Garden of Arif,\" or \"Garden of the Architect\"). This villa dates from the beginning of the 14th century but has been restored several times. The Villa de los Martires (Martyrs' Villa), on the summit of Monte Mauror, commemorates by its name the Christian slaves who were forced to build the Alhambra and confined here in subterranean cells. The Torres Bermejas (Vermilion Towers), also on Monte Mauror, are a well-preserved Moorish fortification, with underground cisterns, stables, and accommodation for a garrison of 200 men. Several Roman tombs were discovered in 1829 and 1857 at the base of Monte Mauror.\n\n\n=== Other features ===\nAmong the other features of the Alhambra are the Sala de la Justicia (Hall of Justice), the Patio del Mexuar (Court of the Council Chamber), the Patio de Daraxa (Court of the Vestibule), and the Peinador de la Reina (Queen's Robing Room), in which there is similar architecture and decoration. The palace and the Upper Alhambra also contain baths, rows of bedrooms and summer-rooms, a whispering gallery and labyrinth, and vaulted sepulchres.\nThe original furniture of the palace is represented by one of the famous Alhambra vases, very large Hispano-Moresque ware vases made in the Sultanate to stand in niches around the palace. These famous examples of Hispano-Moresque ware date from the 14th and 15th centuries. The one remaining in the palace, from about 1400, is 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) high; the background is white and the decoration is blue, white and gold.\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\n\n=== In literature ===\n\nParts of the following works are set in the Alhambra:\n\nWashington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra. This is a collection of essays, verbal sketches, and stories. Irving lived in the palace while writing the book and was instrumental in introducing the site to Western audiences.\nSalman Rushdie's The Moor's Last Sigh\nAmin Maalouf's Leo Africanus, depicting the reconquest of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs.\nPhilippa Gregory's The Constant Princess, depicting Catalina the Infanta of Spain as she lived in the Alhambra after her parents took Granada.\nFederico Garc\u00eda Lorca's play Do\u00f1a Rosita the Spinster, mentioned by title character Do\u00f1a Rosita in her song/speech to the Manola sisters.\nPaulo Coelho's novel The Alchemist\nAli Smith's The Accidental\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's play Man and Superman\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai's Seiobo There Below\nHanya Yanagihara's A Little Life\n\n\n=== In music ===\nThe plot of the Ballet-h\u00e9ro\u00efque entitled Za\u00efde, Reine De Grenade, by the French Baroque composer Joseph-Nicolas-Pancrace Royer (c. 1705\u20131755), takes place at the Alhambra. Alhambra has directly inspired musical compositions as Francisco T\u00e1rrega's famous tremolo study for guitar Recuerdos De La Alhambra. Claude Debussy's piece for two pianos composed in 1901, Lindaraja, and the prelude, La Puerta Del Vino, from the second book of preludes composed from 1912 to 1913. Isaac Alb\u00e9niz wrote a piano suite Recuerdos De viaje, which included a piece called \"En La Alhambra\", while his suite Iberia contained a piece called \"El Albacin\". Alb\u00e9niz also composed an uncompleted Suite Alhambra.\n\n\"En Los Jardines Del Generalife\", the first movement of Manuel de Falla's Noches En Los Jardines De Espa\u00f1a, and other pieces by composers such as Ruperto Chap\u00ed (Los Gnomos De La Alhambra, 1891), Tom\u00e1s Bret\u00f3n, and many others are included in a stream referred to by scholars as Alhambrismo.In 1976, filmmaker Christopher Nupen filmed The Song of the Guitar at the Alhambra which was an hour-long program featuring the legendary Spanish guitarist, Andr\u00e9s Segovia.\nBritish composer Peter Seabourne wrote an extended piano cycle Steps Volume 3: Arabesques (2008-2012) based on shared experiences of the Alhambra with his painter aunt Ann Seabourne, and a movement from his Steps Volume 1 is entitled \"El Suspiro del Moro\" inspired by the legend of the expulsion of the last Moorish King of Granada. Julian Anderson wrote an orchestral piece, Alhambra Fantasy.\nIn pop and folk music, Alhambra is the subject of the Ghymes song of the same name. The rock band Grateful Dead released a song called \"Terrapin Station\" on the 1977 album of the same name. It consisted of a series of small compositions penned by Robert Hunter and put to music by Jerry Garcia; a lyrical section of this suite was called \"Alhambra\". In September 2006, Canadian singer/composer Loreena McKennitt performed live at the Alhambra. The resulting video recordings premiered on PBS and were later released as a 3-disc DVD/CD set called Nights from the Alhambra. The Basque pop group Mocedades performed a song called \"Juntos En La Alhambra\". Alhambra is the title of an EP recording by Canadian rock band, The Tea Party, containing acoustic versions of a few of their songs. Alhambra and Albaic\u00edn are mentioned in the M\u00e4go de Oz song named \"El Paseo De Los Tristes\" from the album entitled Gaia II. On California rapper Dom Kennedy's 2015 album By Dom Kennedy, there is a song entitled \"Alhambra\".\n\n\n=== In mathematics ===\n\nThe Alhambra tiles are remarkable in that they contain nearly all, if not all, of the seventeen mathematically possible wallpaper groups. This is a unique accomplishment in world architecture. M. C. Escher's visit in 1922 and study of the Moorish use of symmetries in the Alhambra tiles inspired his subsequent work on tessellation, which he called \"regular divisions of the plane\".\n\n\n=== In film ===\nMarcel L'Herbier's 1921 film El Dorado features many scenes shot in and around the Alhambra palace. This was the first time permission had been granted for a feature film company to shoot inside the Alhambra palace and L'Herbier gave prominent place to its gardens, fountains and geometric architectural patterns, which became some of the film's most memorable images.\nAnimated films by Spanish director Juan Bautista Berasategui such as Ahmed, El Principe De La Alhambra and El Embrujo Del Sur are based on stories in Washington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra.\nColumbus interview with Queen Isabella in Conquest of Paradise representing Granada after the Reconquest were filmed at Alhambra. As well as the Palace Scenes of Kingdom of Heaven representing Jerusalem during the Cruzades. Both films were made by Ridley Scott.\nThe Court of the Lions was depicted in Assassin's Creed (2016) when Sultan Muhammad XII surrenders the 'Apple of Eden', a powerful artifact in the center of the movie plot, in exchange for his son's safe return. Both the Court of the Lions and Granada's Albaicin are featured on The animated film Tad Jones: The Hero Returns.The fictional Broadway theatre (the interior actually Auckland, New Zealand's Civic Theatre), in which Kong is displayed as the 'Eighth Wonder of the World' in 2005's King Kong, is named \"The Alhambra\".2018 South Korean television series Memories of the Alhambra is based in Granada, Spain. The CEO of an investment company that specializes in optical devices, travels to Granada, Spain to meet the creator of the game. He gets entangled in a mysterious incident, and the border between the real world and the AR world begins to blur.\n\n\n=== In board games ===\nDirk Henn's game Der Palast von Alhambra, literally \"The Palace of the Alhambra\". Players compete to get funds and pay contractors to build the best palace complex. It was published by Queen Games with numerous expansion packs. It won the Spiel des Jahres award in 2003.\n\n\n=== In astronomy ===\nThere is a main belt asteroid named Alhambra.\n\n\n=== In architecture ===\nThe Alhambra inspired:\n\nthe synagogue Isaac M.

          "While on a trip to Spain we were in Granada and went to see the Alhambra Palace. This was originally built as a citadel by the Moors in the 13th century. besides the wonderful architecture of the palace with intricate stone cut likje lace there are also b eautiful fountains and",
          "This is quite an interesting museum, particularly if you are an art lover, and in this case a particular period sort of art. There is much on Islamic art and other art as well. We found that touring the palaces themselves was a lot more interesting, however.",
          "Make sure you do not miss this place. It is worth 20 -30 minutes of your time. You will learn to appreciate Islamic art. A must.",
          "We went in here when at the alhambra. It is quite interesting and worth a look in. Art museum is very good.",
          "The Museum of Alhambra is in the Palacio de Carlos V in the Alhambra complex. The building is impressive but I think much more and interesting use could have been made of this huge space. Worth a very quick visit.",
          "Guys the museum is over rated however if you have spare time then you cold see it. But for some reason if you dont you have missed nothing much.",
          "A highlight of our trip, don\u2019t skip it. The new exhibit about the links to N Africa is outstanding. There is a small art museum up the very steep stairs, it is mostly religious art but there was also a nice mis of more modern things as well and a good temporary exhibit with very",
          "This museum is inside the Palace of Carlos V, just across the way from the main Alhambra attraction, the Nasrid Palaces. Entrance is included with your overall admission, and we felt that it was worth the time to stop in. No pictures are allowed inside, but we were able to see",
          "One of the delights of the Alhambra is that there are so many interesting things to see. The museum and art gallery in the Palacio de Carlos V is excellent with some superb paintings, beautifully displayed. Entry is free if you have an EC passport. The 'bull ring' courtyard in",
          "Emperor Carlos V ordered the construction of this palace annexed to the Alhambra. Thanks God he did not destroyed the Alhambra. The entire property of the Alhambra was abandoned for may years and restoration has not brought the Spanish section to its former glory yet.",
          "Very few places outdo your expectations. But the Alhambra and the palaces are truly beautiful and so different from anything we have seen elsewhere in Spain and Europe. Spent a whole day there and could easily have spent longer.",
          "The Museum of Alhambra is inside the Palacio de Carlos V, and houses a permanent collection of art and objects from the Nasrid. Highly recommended.",
          "It's well worth spending some extra time on your visit to the Alhambra to visit its Museum, if only to experience more detail and familiarize yourself with the history and culture behind the epitome of Moorish Architecture in Spain, and the circumstances that led to both its",
          "Organic materials are delicate and seldom survive. The wood, leather and parchment artifacts in this collection are exceptional. No photographs, free admission to the museum itself.",
          "Plans for a few hours to fully appreciate this large infrastructure which shows so well another culture that was not originally native to Europe. It is beautifully built, proudly showcasing the power and wealth of the owners. Amazing architecture and landscaping, one can imagine",
          "A small but well displayed collection of Nasrid art and design. No visit is complete without a stop in this museum.",
          "Can\u2019t take pictures in there which was disappointing but it was a nice museum. I would think they would have AC to protect the items but it was not on the day I was there. I would not pay to go in there if it was not a part of a package deal.",
          "Featuring the restoration of the Alhambra as well as \"signs of the times,\" such as travel posters, cameras, etc. it is fascinating to see the before and after photos. It is located on the first floor of the Charles V Palace. If time is an issue at the larger Alhambra, I would",
          "Located in the Palacio de Carlos V and accessible from the inside circular courtyard, this museum has a rich collection of splendid paintings - unfortunately, a strict no-photo policy is enforced. Well worth a visit!",
          "The museum of Alhambra is another MUST-SEE location within the Alhambra complex and worth the visit!",
          "Originally a fortress, its ruins were rebuilt in the mid 13th century to its current splendour. \u2018The Red One\u2019, so named because of the red coloured earth used, is simple in its appearance but exhibits the most amazing Islamic architecture. The carved stucco is stunning.",
          "This museum presents the carving, ceramics and woodwork of Alhambra in a modern elegant format. A stark concrete and stone space uses stainless wall mounts for the artwork. Very helpful side panels described the creation of the ornament in English as well as Spanish. I learned",
          "Not sure if this is normal but I visited Alhambra on a Monday and was greeted with a notice stuck on the door stating that the museum was closed on Mondays. Ce la vie.",
          "If you want to see beautiful bowls and tiles from centuries past go here. Not too overwhelming and no crowds .",
          "To be completely honest, as a stonemason I was far more interested in what the building was telling me about its history, than the museums artifacts. I was quite surprised to see such a large exhibition of Victorian British artists, which I did find very interesting but I have",
          "It is nice to see, and it is free, included in your ticket of the palaces visit. But you should see it soon before it closes as it close earlier and fully on monday",
          "Quick 20-30 minute walk around really shows you lots of history from items found in the Alhambra, and even a section which shows you under the city floors. Many of the items like the lions used to be outside 20-30 years ago but it is nice to see them well preserved.",
          "This is a small musuem with some beautiful objects from the area. There are coins, pottery, doors, and other objects from when Granada was a Muslim kingdom. Entrance is free with your Alhambra ticket and the museum only takes about 30 minutes or so. It is in the Carlos V",
          "after the Nasrid Palace. What made it MORE special was volunteer ANA.....who \"cornered us\" while we were meandering and made the rest of the exhibits \"come to life\". We enjoyed her immensely....a 75 yr old Brit married to an 85 yr old Spanish guy. She could have been my 'friend",
          "A free museum featuring art and artifacts from the Alhambra and Andalucia. Definitely worth a visit; descriptions were in both English and Spanish. It certainly added to the experience of visiting the Nazrid Palace.",
          "Take the time to visit the he museum. Many artifacts (pottery and tiles) from the time of the Moors.",
          "Great little museum off the Carlos V site. We went back the day after seeing Alhambra. Mostly because we saw Alhambra on Monday and the museum was closed. Glad we did because it would have been too much. Entry is free. Well worth going back.",
          "Very informative and not to be missed. Each artefact is labelled and you\u2019re walking through history as you walk through each room. Each room was themed and well lit and labelled.",
          "This is free (part of the Alhambra ticket) so worth going if you have the audiotour (otherwise because a lot of the captions are in Spanish it's difficult to know what you're looking at). Gives a great overview of the history of the Alhambra.",
          "This place is huge and with so much to see and area to cover, having a private tour guide was helpful. True there aren't many artifacts at the site, but the grounds are lovely and the Lion fountain and other areas had recently been cleaned and restored which was nice to see.",
          "While on a trip to Granada I took the long walk up the hill to the Alhambra Palace. I have a proper tour booked later on in the year in October but wanted to see what was there in advance. My son and I took a tour of the museums which are free to enter and view. It was pretty",
          "I wanted to know everything I could possibly know about the history of such an iconic place. I was satisfied without being overwhelmed",
          "Numerous historic and religious pieces laid out sympathetically, different rooms with different themes. In the final room, beyond the exit, there are newer pieces to enjoy",
          "It is quite a small museum but it is free and worth a visit as it will be a good 20 minutes spent. Not everything is translated into english but the staff are very friendly and happy to translate.",
          "It's a decent and free museum. Collection consists of some coins, doors and fountains. There is no English explanations for items.",
          "we had a private guide who talked us through the many interesting exhibits and the museum was quiet, refined, and elegant.",
          "We visited Alhambra as part of our Andalusia tour. The place is extraordinarily. The moorish palace is beautiful. The Arabic etched were so intricate and so interesting. Highly recommended to see. Spend your time in Granda for at least 3 days and take your time to enjoy the",
          "This delightful Museum provides an insight into Moorish Culture and has some really excellent exhibits. It's rooms are carefully laid out and displays are in English and Spanish. There are some stunning illustrated Korans, beautiful doorways, windows and art work. As an insight",
          "The museum is located on the ground floor of the Palace of Charles V and has seven rooms. The first hall is for exhibitions and the remainder are located in chronological order, which makes it easy to follow. The rooms are small and interesting with lots of ceramics and",
          "With the grand Alhambra around, this museum does not provide much to see. Of course there are some interesting exhibits.",
          "The place to spend your time is at the Palace. The museum has some interesting pieces but unfortunately for it the rest of the site out shines it.",
          "Free to enter what is a fairly small exhibition. The staff were really helpful and we found the pieces and explanations really interesting!",
          "When it comes to the Alhambra just take your ticket online and visit it all. Each and every place is a masterpiece.",
          "This museum gives colour and depth to an Alhambra visit and gives you time to appreciate the craftsmanship of the items kept here. The museum is spacious and airy with lots of fine pieces on display which presumably change over regularly per theme.",
          "Very interesting collection that adds depth and interest to the visit of the Al Hambra...... one can only assume the collection will grow.....",
          "This is a relatively small exhibition, located within the Palace of Carlos V. It's free and doesn't take more than 10-15 minutes of your time. The most interesting aspect to me was the film show which was shall I say thought provoking in its choice of words - good to see some",
          "Free entry, gives you a different perspective to more fascinating facts and artefacts from bygone era, really enjoyable visit",
          "It is quite amazing what they have dug up in the renovations of this place. Small and sparse but still worth a visit.",
          "This is a small, modest and limited museum, although there is some interesting piece have have a good amount of information in Spanish and English. The museum is free, so can't complain too much. Although there's nothing really outstanding that's a must see, the museum is inside",
          "Absorb centuries of royal history and impressive multicultural architectural influences, in this enchanting palace-fortress. Perched high above the ancient city of Granada, it is easy to understand why The Alhambra is the number one tourist destination in Spain. The abundant,",
          "I visited this beautiful place years ago and managed then to drag my parents and husband years later........without booking in advance! big mistake - stupid mistake I am sure many will be thinking. So please remember to book in advance, as they get booked out for weeks in",
          "By far one of the best places I have visited in tourist mode. I would add on the Generalife area as well as it has as much to offer. There are many places to relax, take it slow....so much beauty.",
          "This place is amazing and worth the trip even if your not staying in Granada although I would recommend staying in Granada. It does get booked up and you have to book prior to arriving. I recommend going in the Morning and also recommend getting a Taxi if you find walking up",
          "Last of the muslim emperor Boabdil capitol in europe. Beautiful architecture, wooden and ceramic precious.",
          "If you have some time before or after your visit to the Alhambra, the Alhambra museum is a nice place for a short visit. Information about artifacts on the audio guide. Not much information given without it.",
          "This an interesting small-medium sized museum which holds a collection of many items from the Alhambra site and beyond. Note that this isn't the Alhambra itself but a museum on the site. Well worth a look, but not an integral part of the experience.",
          "We went back to the museum after our guided tour was finished and found it to be very interesting. This is where you can see the original carvings and furnishings since most of what you see in the palaces is a reproduction or restoration. It takes less than an hour. No photos",
          "We did tour it as part of our private guided tour of the Alhambra. Our guide explained his favorite items. Not the Louvre or Met. Just a few items. Air Conditioned and that helps.",

          "You can't visit the Alhambra and then miss out on this little place. It may not be the best thing on the planet, but it's worth a visit to see some of the objects on display which you cannot see anywhere else.",
          "The Alhambra museum is certainly worth a visit. It has amazing artefacts such as pottery and wooden doors from the palaces and the period. Its quite well signposted with English translations. I was also pleased to see staff preventing people from taking photographs or touch",

          "We were on a trip from Torremolenos and had a wonderful guide to take us round the place. It is well worth a visit to see the amazing reflections and stone work in the place and especially to hear the history of the place from the guide. We all had an earpiece so couldn't fail",
          "Some yers ago I watch a program on TV where they mentioned the elaborated mathematics but mostly geometrics, muslims used to create the Alhambra, and when you are there and you see the perfection of the construction and all the trimmings in walls and ceilings that look like lace",

          "If your visiting Spain, make sure you include a trip to Granada and the infamous Alhambra, you will not regret this once in a lifetime visit!!!",
          "Reasonable museum having some of the original items from the Alhambra. Gives a general idea of the history of the area with pre Alhambra finds. There is some information in each room in English. Interesting add on to a day at the Alhambra but not worth visiting on its own.",
          "I did not expect it so beautiful. It is incredible to see what they achieved during their period about art. We enjoyed so much the tour and the beautiful places we visited.",
          "I bought the tickets ahead and had time reserved to see the garden of Nasrid. The flow of people was just fine and it's understandable it's summertime and the crowd is inevitable. The place is phenomenal. I enjoyed the Generalife and the Nasrid the most. The audio guide was",

          "\"The impressive Alhambra, Organization disastrous\" It seems incredible that in one of the most visited places in Spain have such a monumental organizational disaster. Staff do not speak English, lack of signage and total chaos when organizing the hours of entry. . All",
          "Quick visit during our Alhambra Tour. A 10-15 minute tour is plenty in this air conditioned museum. It is a nice respite from the 45 C degree (113 F) weather outside.",
          "The museum is very nice, filled with great things. Its just the fact that the Alahmbra itself is so tiring, i had little energy to explore it.",
          "To understand the history and culture of Granada, a visit to the Alhambra museum is essential. Make sure to give yourself enough time to see everything at this unique attraction.",
          "OK for a quick visit but there's not much there and 10-15 minutes is all the time it will take to see everything.",
          "Went here a few years ago with my parents and we loved it. The views are amazing and the architecture is stunning. It's especially good if your interested in history like me, though some others might get bored. Definitely a must visit for those who like their Spanish history!",
          "This is a must-see place! Alhambra is absolutely gorgeous with a stunning view, beautiful architecture, and spectacular gardens. Skipping this landmark would be a shame! Pictures definitely don't do it justice.",
          "Outstanding. The museum shows you the true scope of this magnificent place. It reveals many of the ideas behind it's concept. A must",
          "The Alhambra is Impressive but not as Impressive as I expected, but probably that was caused by the heath, 44 Of course iT is \u00e0 must to have seen iT once in your life but as many times before, reality is less interesting as expected.",
          "There are many reasons to visit La Alhambra. The most important is the perfection of the builders and the conception of create a palace at the top of a hill with sumptuous gardens and beautiful rooms. It is just incredible!",

          "I love history! This place was wonderful with lots of lessons. We spent the day and could have come back for another. The gardens are manicured to perfection. Our guide was very knowledgeable of everything including our questions. You can feel the age of time gone by as you",
          "Entry to this museum is included in the Alhambra ticket and it is definitely worth visiting. It isn't the main attraction but it houses all the major finds from the site and surrounding area so it fits in with your overall visit. If you have the audio guide you will get a bit",
          "This place is just amazing and so impressive. It's got its own history and stories behind it so a guide is a good thing to have and listen to when you go there.",
          "You can find many books about La Alhambra and general history of Andalusia as well as great souvenirs.",
          "I cannot find the words to describe this place. It really has to be experienced. Not a cheap visit, but well worth the cost. We booked an afternoon visit so we could experience the light changing and the sun setting - beautiful!",
          "A great place to spend about 30 minutes on your trip to the Alhambra. A nice way to get out of the heat and some beautiful relics on display. Admission is free, as it is covered in the Alhambra ticket.",
          "The Museum at the Alhambra may be small as compared to other museums in Spain but it does have a good array of items dating back to the glory days of the Alhambra. The displays are easy to understand and well laid out.",
          "I cannot begin to describe the beauty of the Alhambra and the museum is just a far cry. Visit only if you have time, as the real deal is just next door.",
          "Magnificent architecture complemented by awesome views. I was so pleased to have been able to see this what a gem! Each part has its own magical touch . The mosaics , water features and decorative walls are to many to list.But book in advance preferably on line as my telephone",
          "One of the greatest places I've ever visited. Organized, cleaned, well prepared for large groups. The visit was 3 hours long and I don't regret a minute of it. If you don't know plan a trip to get there. Impressive.",
          "Definitely worth a visit, if possible before you visit the Nasrid palaces, so you go in with a bit of a historical background. The volunteer guide was very knowledgeable and the displays were well made. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "We loved the historic buildings, beautiful views of the city, ornate gardens of the Generalife. We didn't like the massive queues or that you can queue for ages only to find the Nazrid palaces (one of the main features of the Alhambra) have reached their footfall quota for the",
          "When I first saw La Alhambra, I say this is one of the wonders of the world to see before you die. I was not excessive in assessing this place, because what I saw was beautiful, I was grateful to be able to come here to see it. If you have time and money, take time to visit,",
          "The rare and exquisite beauty of the Alhambra cannot be appreciated from photos. As beautiful as it appears in photos, it is ten times more breath-taking. You will wish you had the place to yourself because you will want to revel in the details, but shut the crowds out and",
          "This is in the Charles V Palace, which is in the public area and can be visited separate from the Alhambra ticket. Public entry is near the bottom of the Alhambra complex, so it is a pretty easy walk from town on heavily shaded pedestrian path. A lot of pottery and container",
          "You get to see lots of bits and pieces from the Alhambra up close. Not much else but it is free and on site so why not take a stoll through?",
          "The quality of the craftmanship is a pleasure to see, when you think when this was created you realise the skills that the artisans had, even though the didnt enjoy the use of modern power tools it makes it even more fantastic",
          "It is a small museum. Free entrance, but nothing special to notice that you wont see it in all the other palaces of Alhambra. They keep there just fragments and pieces.",
          "We paid for the tickets on the Internet, to secure a time that was convenient and to avoid long lines. The palaces are absolutely beautiful and deserve long hours for in depth visits.",
          "This visit is for free, realized after visiting the set, just before we left the Alhambra and includes many riches of the time. The decor, elements that are conserved and two samples of the Palace Nazari (huge door carved and decorated wood all ...). Highly recommended (free",

          "The architecture and history is sure to inspire any visitor to wonder how something so beautiful and technically crafted was done such a long time ago without the benefit of today's technology. what could they have done with today's construction methods....?",
          "This is in the basement of the King Charles palace next to the Alhambra It is small but has an interesting mix of items. i have to admit that we visited this towards the end of our trip round the Alhambra and the staff wanted to close up so we rushed the visit - I will for",

          "This museum is free to enter with your Alhambra entry ticket. It is not huge but has some interesting exhibits which help you to understand a bit more about the history of the site and its previous inhabitants. It was a bit drizzly on the day we visited so it was also a good way",
          "The Alhambra lived up to its reputation. The palaces are grand, the water features well placed; the workmanship. Next time I'll stay at one of the hotels (the Parador in the convent or the small B&B) within the complex. Lots of walking but plenty of places to rest. Take",
          "Good to get a bit of background on the cultural aspects of the people that inhabited the Alhambra over the years. Some of the art work that is preserved in the museum is amazing! Free to enter on your Alhambra ticket!",
          "The Alhambra is a must do for anyone visiting Spain. The Town of Granada, is totaly quaint and beautiful. The Alhambra is a highlight but you will need at least half the day.",
          "I love going to museums and this was amazing. It was such a beautiful part of the Alhambra. I would love to come again.",
          "One of the biggest and most spectacular palace complex I've ever been. We spent there half-day in July and we didn't have enough. We've been on July and waited just 10 min for tickets.",
          "If you like museums, you must visit this one. It is a real treasure. They have special exhibits too and we saw one of the greatest flamenco singer in Granda.",
          "Of course this is the monument of Granada and a must see. The inner palace works with half an hour tile slots mentioned on the ticket. The beauty of the historic site is beond remarks but the organisation can be improved. Advance booking is recommended but the downside is that",

          "We have visited before, but this time wanted to take the children. it is just as scenic and atmospheric as before, although be warned there are a lot of steps for little legs! And probably not particularly wheelchair or pushchair friendly.",
          "Fascinating, dont miss it. There is so much to see and its so interesting, a definite visitor attraction.",
          "This is a must if you go see the Alhambra. The information made the tour of the Alhambra even better because we knew so much about it afterwords. Definitely a must!!",
          "I don't believe my eyes, really awesome structure with almost 1,000 years history behind it. Huge place get lost and puzzled yourself without knowing where you were at, need map to find the washroom. No kidding, you will be lost within 30 minutes.",

          "We almost missed this museum but was a very good relaxing visit audio was well worth taking numbered exhibits staff spoke very good English and very helpful",
          "Recommendation:1. You need 4 hrs.to see Alhambra.2.Better to buy the ticket for Morning hrs because later afternoon you can make trips by bus around the old city and Gipsy area too.3 If you have a ticket for afternoon time frame buy a ticket to Palacios Nazaries for early time.",
          "Worth the walk up the hill. Great views of the Alhambra with the snow capped mountains in the background. It was however crowded and there were lots of vendors trying to sell things. We visited on a Saturday afternoon so perhaps it is less busy on a weekday.",
          "One does not need to spend more than an hour at the Museum. Merits a visit to provide more information on the history of Alhambra.",
          "Do not confuse the Museum with the Alhambra itself. It is housed in the palace built by Carlos I near the Palacios Nazaries. The structure is worth a quick walk around inside...but not much more....unless you are researching Moorish art in the Museum itself. The Fine Art",
          "The beauty of the Alhambra Palaces is unbelievable, just make sure that you book your tickets to the palaces in advance on the web.",
          "You cannot come to Granada and leave without seeing the Alhambra. Beautiful, beyond belief. But don't turn up and expect to get in. Entrances are now limited in number, and you have to prebook, at your hotel or on-line.",
          "In the Alhambra complex of one of the palaces, and free to EU visitors this is a tasteful and stylish collection that is well worth a look. Check the days and times of opening carefully as they are complex and typically Sanish!",

          "If you are an art lover this is a place to visit. There is a garden tour and the real Palace. Garden is beautifully captured and has a breathtaking city view from the hill. Don't forget to check the Palace at night. They re-open after sunset.",
          "Must have seen in Granada, stone art details are fantastic, I was there very hot day, it is a pity because must be wonderful in spring or autumn, even winter must be better than May:)",
          "This is a must if you visit Granada! Me and my friends took our time looking around and taking pictures. I'd say you should make it a day trip to truly enjoy calmly and peacefully. Also make sure to buy the tickets ahead of time because it's a popular attraction! The day we went",
          "Modern building but full of historical facts within it. very organise and well structured in terms of historical events while going through step by step within the musuem. Artifacts were preserved very well presented in accordance to the histroical events.",
          "Not the ideal month to visit the Alhambra! A very hot day towards the end of July. The tour takes a good three hours and culminates with the most impressive part of all. Buildings are fascinating as are the grounds and gardens and amazing how they diverted water to that",
          "the main tourist attraction in Granada and for good reason. Stunning Arabic ornaments and the opportunity to see and know a special culture.",
          "Everything perfect. Visiting the place allows us to understand and live the great moment of older spanish way of life in going through history and culture. Everything has been preserved in their origins.",
          "Like my rating,for the palaces absolutely superb, very well maintained the artefacts are well preserved and of interest some of these items must be priceless especially the old chair the bought from a flea market just by chance.",
          "While the visit was pleasurable, none of the best known Spanish Maestros is represented here. As a consequence, we were practically alone in the museum on a day in which otherwise Alhambra was as populated as usual.",
          "Gives a sense of what the Alhambra palaces would have been like when they were lived in - furniture, pottery, rugs.",
          "The Alhambra is magnificent and beautiful. To see the combination of architecture from the Moors and the Christians is impressive. The walk to the Alhambra was uphill and beautiful.",
          "Fascinating! Brilliantly maintained. If you do nothing else, but visit Alhambra then your trip would have been worthwhile!",
          "The architecture is magnificent , the tiles, the carvings, the slim columns, and the arches All so delicate and colorful These and more will make you love this place. Just be there early so you have enough time to see as much as possible",
          "Sited within the Palace of Charles the 5th. At first I thought it was going to be yet another depressing art museum full of dark religious paintings. In reality, you walk through well lit rooms, well signed and a different theme in each area. From the early paintings and",
          "The museums small but interesting all the same , but nothing here that is. Vital to your visit to the Alhumbra. It's more about art.",
          "really liked this museum for an overview of Spanish art. woul dhave liked to see more informations on the artists, perhaps some books for sale featuring the work and why it is important in this context, even a takeaway leaflet explaining things a bit better, and would have loved",
          "located in Charles V palace in Alhambra. it had separate ticket, not covered in Alhambra ticket cost. The museum was \"ok\", nothing too exciting there.",
          "The Alhambra Museum explains many of the things one sees at the Nazari Palace, especially the lions at the Lion Fountain. There is also a very beautiful Vase of the Gazelles, with a golden sheen. From my research it may have been made in Malaga during the 14th or 15th century.",
          "We were there in the off season sit was not too crowded and the queues were short. In high season I would suggest you book your tickets in advance and beware rthe high season parking charges. Having said all that, take your time to absorb the atmosphere and there is so much to",
          "There is an amazing array of history and the buildings demonstrate the talents and skills of builders that seems to have died with them!!",
          "The museum is right outside the entry gate to the Alhambra. It had many pretty artifacts but I found most of them overpriced.I most bought some magnets.",
          "A huge place, you need at least 6hours to see all the attractions and museum in Alhambra. It will be better if you buy the night ticket to Nasrid Palace and come again the next day to enjoy the other areas, so you wont exhaust it. The ornaments in Nasrid Palace is faboulous,",
          "The museum takes up one corner of the Palace of Charles V and contains the best collection of Spanish-Moorish Art in general and of Nasrid Art in particular that you will find in one showing. The artifacts represent items used within Alhambra from slightly before 1500.",
          "This was included in the one-price ticket and definitely worth a visit as they have a lot of the original pieces you see throughout the rest of the complex.",
          "As I noted in an earlier review, there are some very good collections that help explain the context of the Alhambra. Upstairs are painting collections--less important than the downstairs exhibits",
          "We were quite excited to find that no ticket was required to get in the Museum. We had been around the ticketed part of the Alhambra a week previously and had a few hours to spare in Granada so went to investigate. Interpretation was provided in Spanish and English, helpfully.",
          "This is a museum located in the ground floor of the Palace of Charles V (Palacio de Carlos V), not the Calat Alhambra (Alhambra Palace) itself. It is a museum of Antiques of the Alhambra and Spanish-Moorish Art. Admission to this museum is free. There are many interesting",
          "This museum is included with the cost of tickets and is somewhat interesting. You can view some bullets and cannon balls, weapons and un-preserved pieces of ceiling, but nothing that really enhanced my appreciation of the Alhambra",
          "I did enjoy the trip to the museum. It attempted to give a representation of everyday life through the collection. Well worth the visit.",
          "The entrance is free for EU citizens. An interesting collection in a nice building! Worth a visit. Outside, very nice view of Granada old town.",
          "If Granada is a beautiful woman, then Alhambra is the magnificient necklace of her! I've just returned yesterday and I am still full of Alhambra.",
          "Located in the palace of Charles V. Has a set of interesting works of art. It also displays temporary exhibitions",
          "The museum of the Alhambra is situated in the ground floor of the Palacio de Carlos V. It's spread over seven halls and is a fine collection of Spanish-Moorish Art in general and of Nasrid Art in particular. Not a popular place for the hordes of tourists so you will be able to",
          "Prebook your tickets through Ticketmaster (print them) or ask your accommodation to book them. Then go at opening time. This way you shouldn't need to queue in the heat with lots of people. When prebooking you must specify the time you want to visit the palaces inside the",
          "Having made time to see this, I was surprised how uninspiring the palace was - admittedly beautiful on first viewing but very samey throughout. The grounds were much better and there were some real gems in the garden rooms. Beware, if queuing for entry to the palace make sure",
          "Amazing place to visit but in summer you must plan ahead and go early! Buy your tickets before you go and plan your timed visit to the Nasrid Palace early otherwise it gets too hot to enjoy. Take water with you, there are a few drinking water fountains to refill, that's all.",
          "Don't forget to bring some money for your souvenirs! There are so many beautiful things to buy & bring home.",
          "1000 amateur photographers trying to be creative, when all there doing is blocking the walkways and slowing down the tour. It's impressive but not worth the 45 minute wait in line or hassle.",

          "Absolutely amazing site! It's huge and you need to dedicate at least a half day. Pre-reservation on line at least 3 weeks in advance to see the main attraction 'palace naides' is important to know. The gardens are super, especially the water staircase. Make sure to view",
          "Informative and enjoyable. Magnificent atmospheric environment. It's an active event, with a lot of walking to see all the monument. You'd probably have to count on spending at least 3 hours there, or miss out on something.",
          "everything that was said about this place is true, namely that this is one of the world's wonders. I've been there several times and will go there again. the beauty of this place is strengthened by the fact that very few changes were made since it was built ( compared to some",
          "Yes, I discovered that many missed detail which I need to pay an attention to in my photos. Sadly the Lions fountain was under maintenance. Apart, its a place full of details which you need to be very relaxed in time to look deeply into the artistic and wall art. The people who",
          "Although a long time ago since I visited Museum of Alhambra it was very well laid out and extremely interesting as to the history of the area",
          "You need a good three hours to enjoy the whole area in a relaxed manner and , in spite of the advance booking system for the Nasrid Palace be prepared to queue before the set time. The interior of the palace is quite spectacular and has been really well restored and maintained",
          "The only place in the Alhambra that has artifacts and written descriptions in English about what you are seeing. Helps to pui the whole thing in perpective - well laid out and very interesting. Recommended as part of the visit to Alhambra.",
          "This is a Gem. It was not included on our guided tour. Fortunately we decided to stay behind for lunch at the Parador Alhambra. We were waitlisted and had time to wander. The Museum is fabulous; the artifacts brilliant-unfortunately no brochure or material in English.",
          "It's so hard to describe the beauty of this place you have to see it yourself to understand. By tickets at least 1 month before you are coming or else you'll not be able to see the area: Palacios Nazaries (only 400 people every day) see this area.",
          "Whats not to like it was not too full in January so you could get around easily and see everything and the signage was informative",
          "definitely worth a visit. we booked tickets to Nasrid palace and Generalife gardens a few weeks in advance by selecting a particular time slot to enter the Nasrid palace. Be there in the queue 30 mins before your time of entry. You however need to get bar coded tickets as",
          "Erika and I arrived here in the off season which is the winter. Our visit was pleasant and intriguing. Because it was the off season, they were fewer people in the palace which allowed us so spend as much time as we wanted viewing the grounds and taking photos. The weather",
          "The museum allows you to see pieces of the original painted decoration from the palaces - a lovely treat after walking through all of the Nasrid palaces. Worth walking through even if you have to pay the 1.50 euro required of non-EU citizens.",
          "Lots to see in the museum really enjoyed the visit, and was surprised that if your from Europe then there is no entry charge.",
          "The museum is not large by any means but is free to enter as part of your ticket to the Alhambra site. There are many small exhibits along with some larger ones, but descriptions were not always available in English therefore it was not possible to find out what they all were.",
          "There are many interesting things in the museum, but I would have liked some information. There is very little in the way of explanation.",
          "Not open on a Monday. Not a huge place but have got some amazing artifacts such as old coins, pillars, chess boards, bowls, furniture etc. Well worth a visit",
          "This 7-room museum does not have an admission fee and is a nice supplement to a visit to the Alhambra. It showcases some excellent examples of Muslim architecture in Spain. The explanations are mostly in Spanish, so without a Spanish speaker you might have trouble getting the",

          "I am not one normally for Museums but I have to admit these were pretty special and well worth spending some time in after the visit to the rest of the Alhambra and Generalife. They are also very well air conditioned so a wonderful place to cool off before venturing to the next",
          "Small but interesting this is located within the AlHambra, and is a must if you are there. Remember if you are a EU citizen you get in for free, they did not ask for ID, just where we were from....",
          "When visiting Alhambra do not miss this. The main thing every one wants to see are Generalife and Palace of Nazaries however this museum contains a gem of information about Spanish Moorish art.",
          "One can get tired of religious art pretty quickly but this was well selected and many paintings were important gems, part of Spain's patrimony. There were also some more modern works that we enjoyed and it was worth the forty minutes or so we spent there.",
          "If there is just one monument that you can visit in all of Spain, it has to be El Alhambra! It is a majestic fortress built on the top of a mountain, with the Sierra Nevada in its back drop. Nothing can quite prepare you for its sheer brilliance!!",

          "It took me two visits to take in the full magnitude of this awsome monument and even now I could do an annual visit and still see things I had not noticed before , such is the size of the site. The place varies with the seasons so it is worth going at different times of the",
          "Check this out before you need to use your valuable timed ticket!",
          "Photos might prepare you somewhat for the marvels of the Alhambra, but you really have to be there to understand the magnitude and the incredible care for detail. The Granadians must be eternally grateful for the Moros building this place before they were driven out by the Reyes",
          "Neat, quick little museum on the grounds of the Alhambra. Had enthusiastic helpful staff. We especially liked some of the ceramics and the lions.",
          "Incorporate a visit to the museum into your visit to the Alhambra. Not huge however it is well set out and presents a picture of life fpr those who once lived at the Alhambra as well as the site's artwork found during excavations and restoration work. Really interesting and",
          "The Alhambra Museum is a very good museum. One of the prime exhibits is the very large Vase of the Gazelles in the museum, which depicts gazelles. This has a golden sheen and was made by the Moors in Malaga in the 14th or 15th century. These large vases were shipped from Malaga",
          "What was present was informative and interesting, but there was not a lot there to my way of thinking.",
          "There isn't much more to say. The views were amazing as you can see all the city and shows the grandeur of the design. The palaces were beautiful, especially Nasrid Palaces. Well worth it!",
          "The Alhambra is beautiful and takes up most of the day to appreciate its beauty and history. Dont forget your walking shoes and water - although there are places to buy water and ice-cream. On our second visit we were with a couple and their 15 year old twins and everyone",
          "Very informative and interesting information on the architecture of the alhambra. Bought lots of things here because I appreciate them more once I understand the story behind the architecture.",
          "Learn what it was like to live in the Alhambra, for the Emir and his harem and extended family. This gives insight into Spanish history, the conflict among the Catholics and the Moors, and the impact on history,cuisine and music today.",
          "So interesting to see the influence of the Arab culture with the Spanish. Beautiful place",
          "We visited this museum when at the Alhambra for our tour of the gardens and Palaces. It was free and interesting enough, but if there is a choice between visiting this museum and spending more time in the gardens/palaces, I would definitely prefer the gardens. (If you had the",

          "Definitely take a peek at what the Museum has while you're at Alhambra. While this is obviously not the main attraction, you might find something really cool and worth catching while you're there. There's no additional fee, and it doesn't take long to see it. During our visit,"

        "wiki": "The Forsyte Saga is a British drama television serial that chronicles the lives of three generations of an upper-middle-class family from the 1870s to 1920s. It was based on the books of John Galsworthy's trilogy The Forsyte Saga, which were adapted by Granada Television for the ITV network in 2002 (Series One) and 2003 (Series Two). Additional funding was provided by American PBS station WGBH, as the 1967 BBC version had been a success on PBS in the early 1970s.\n\n\n== Development ==\nMalcolm Bradbury found that approaching the new series \"brings a tear to the eye and a smile to the lips\"; a tear because time had passed the culturally-significant original by, but smile because investment in a classic project is good.The makers of the 2002 version felt that any new production would be compared with the 1967 version, which set the standards for period drama for the next 25 years. The idea came initially from David Liddiment, ITV's director of channels, who seized on the Forsyte novels not only as a great achievement in English literature, but also for their iconic status in British television. Granada were thinking big from the outset of the project - this was clearly something that couldn't be dashed off as a two-parter. The initial plan was for two series, the first an adaptation of The Forsyte Saga and the second continuing with A Modern Comedy.\nSita Williams attached herself to the project in late 1999 and by the start of 2000 was talking to writers and working on the adaptations. Casting began in 2001, first casting the leading roles of Soames, Irene and Bosinney (Williams had seen Damian Lewis in Band of Brothers).\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Episode plots for first series ==\nThis plot summary covers in eight sections the six episodes of the first series only. Series One portrays the first two books and the first interlude of John Galsworthy's trilogy The Forsyte Saga.\n\n\n=== One ===\nIt is 1874. The Forsytes gather to celebrate Winifred Forsyte's (Amanda Root) engagement to Montague Dartie, a penniless but charming man. Her cousin Young Jolyon (Rupert Graves) is absent from the party. We find he is at home with his daughter, June, and her French governess, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. Jolyon and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne are involved in a minor flirtation, but their true feelings for each other are realized when his wife, Frances, falsely accuses him of an indiscretion and Jolyon is ordered to dismiss the governess. They acknowledge their feelings for each other only after this accusation, and he then decides to leave Frances. Young Jolyon finds himself cut off from the Forsyte fortune and family.\nNine years later, Young Jolyon has a son with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and a daughter on the way. He tries to claim some of the capital of his inheritance from his grandfather Forsyte, rather than just existing on his allowance, so he and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne can purchase a larger house. His uncle James, the only remaining trustee, is heavily influenced by James' son Soames (Damian Lewis) and refuses him.\nA prosperous partner in the family law firm, Soames becomes interested in the beautiful but poor Irene Heron (Gina McKee) while on business in the seaside town of Bournemouth, where she lives with her widowed stepmother. Though at first, with youthful enthusiasm, she considers his advances flattering, he ultimately does not appeal to her because of his awkward manner and desire to own things. For example, while at an art gallery, she sees the beauty of a painting, but he sees it as a possession, something to be owned and hung in his hallway. When he proposes, she refuses him despite encouragement from her stepmother because of their impoverished state as a result of Irene's father's death, leaving them only \u00a350 a year to live on. She and her stepmother are invited to visit his family, and she behaves contrary to social expectations when she dances with Winifred when she is supposed to be in mourning. Intrigued by her beauty and danger, Soames forgoes the rules and asks her to dance.\nSome months later, Winifred gives birth to a child, Imogen. Montague (\"Monty\") gives her a string of pearls as a gift. She wonders how he could have afforded them considering that her father did not settle money or a house on Winifred when they married, and Monty is not a wealthy man. At a dance in Bournemouth, Soames attempts to show his continued passion for Irene, but ends up vulgarly kissing her arm in public. She is mortified, and her stepmother is disappointed when Irene refuses him again.\n\n\n=== Two ===\nUnder pressure from her stepmother, Irene accepts Soames' proposal under the condition that if she should not be happy, he should let her go. They share an awkward, rigid kiss in the street.\nYoung Jolyon and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne are now living in a modest house in St John's Wood with their two small children and read in the paper that his wife, Frances, has died. He proposes to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and she happily accepts.\nTwo years later, Irene is trapped in a loveless marriage. Soames is obsessed with his seemingly perfect wife. She secretly takes steps to avoid getting pregnant as the idea of having his child is despicable to her. She finds friendship in Young Jolyon's abandoned daughter, June (Gillian Kearney), who has been raised by her grandfather, Old Jolyon (Corin Redgrave). The 17-year-old June is engaged to a 26-year-old, penniless architect, Philip Bosinney (Ioan Gruffudd). Old Jolyon, who has become like a father to June, will not allow her to marry until Bosinney earns \u00a3400 a year.\nUnbeknown to June and Soames, Bosinney and Irene are instantly attracted to each other. Irene asks that she have her own bedroom under the guise of not being able to sleep well. Soames is not keen on the idea, but she moves out of the room anyway. Hearing of her unhappy life through the gossiping June, Bosinney is further drawn toward Irene. Simultaneously, he grows cold toward June.\nSoames does not like June's influence over his wife and aims to take Irene away from the city. He hopes that she might then concentrate on being a better wife toward him and to produce the heir so desperately wanted by himself and, more importantly, his father. He hires Bosinney to build a house at Robin Hill near Richmond and employs Bosinney as the architect (in the series the house is modelled visibly after Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House). The income will allow Bosinney to earn \u00a3350, not quite enough to allow a marriage but enough for Old Jolyon to allow an engagement between Bosinney and June. Robin Hill will serve as Irene's countryside prison. Meanwhile, Old Jolyon realising that June will soon be lost to him as a companion wishes to renew his relationship with Young Jolyon. He pays his son and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne a visit.\nMeanwhile, the Darties seem to be living a luxurious and happy life. (They now have another child, a son, Val.) Unbeknown to Winifred, Dartie frequently squanders her money on gambling and failed business ventures. She catches him eyeing the pearls he once gave her. Some time later, bailiffs come to their house and repossess items to fulfill Dartie's debt of 100 guineas. Her father, James Forsyte, is thoroughly embarrassed by the situation, especially as their house is rented in his name.\nSoames and Irene discuss the country house. She does not wish to live there, but he insists that she would be happy there eventually, especially when they have children. When she walks away, upset with the idea of children, he waits for her in her bedroom. He persuades her to come back to his bedroom, though she does so reluctantly.\nOld Jolyon, obviously missing company since June's engagement to Bosinney, seeks out his son at his club. They return to Old Jolyon's house and, while sharing a drink, he tries to make up for their estrangement by handing Young Jolyon a cheque for \u00a310,000. Jolyon does not accept it but asks him to invest it for his children.\nBosinney and June are planning their wedding, although he appears to be less enthusiastic about it than she. He goes to Soames's house to discuss Robin Hill, but finds Irene in the drawing room before Soames has come downstairs. They share a kiss. Bosinney and Soames discuss the plans for the house, which is very modern. When Irene shows interest in the architectural style being, as she puts it, with a sense of 'beauty and proportion,' her husband agrees to fund the project for \u00a3500 more than he first agreed to spend. Soames congratulates himself for having found such an innovative architect for the job.\nOld Jolyon finds his son living a bohemian lifestyle with his wife and two children, Jolly (who is also named Jolyon) and Holly. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is suspicious of her father-in-law's sudden interest in their lives, and thanks God for her husband's source of income, his paintings. Young Jolyon tells her that he has discovered that his father has secretly been buying his watercolors as a way of supporting him through the years. Old Jolyon expresses his loneliness to his son.\n\n\n=== Three ===\nJune grows afraid that her wedding will never take place as Bosinney seems always to be working on Robin Hill. She becomes angry at Irene's platitude that the hard times will pass, calls her old friend trite, and leaves in a huff. At Robin Hill, the building continues, but there are misunderstandings in budgeting, as he has gone over the agreed price by \u00a3700+. However, Soames relents because he wants the work done. Meanwhile, Irene and Bosinney's flirtations become more and more dangerous and they have a number of close calls. Irene takes a buggy ride with Soames' Uncle Swithin and suggests that they drive to Robin Hill, obviously in the hope of meeting with Bosinney. Later, pretending to be asleep on the patio, Swithin sees the two lovers heading into the woods where Bosinney confesses his love for Irene and the two share a passionate embrace.\nRumours begin about Irene and Bosinney and Old Jolyon asks his son to speak with June's fianc\u00e9, in an attempt to convince Bosinney to be faithful to June. He refuses because he feels it would be hypocritical, considering his past. Meanwhile, Soames' mother has a talk with Irene. She suggests that perhaps things would be better once they have children. Irene confesses to her, \"I do not love him. I cannot love him. I don't want to love him.\" In the midst of his growing love for Irene, Bosinney snubs June in the street, driving her into a fit of depression.\nThe entire Forsyte family is alerted of Irene and Bosinney's affair with the exception of Soames and June. However, during a ball, they are caught talking outside by Monty Dartie and later flaunt their love for each other by dancing passionately in front of the entire family. June runs off in tears, her grandfather running after her. Irene asks Soames to let her go, but he refuses. He threatens to beat her, but then immediately apologizes. When they get home she runs into her room and locks the door to an enraged Soames. Determined to ruin Bosinney for stealing his wife's love, he sues Bosinney for breach of contract for increasing their agreed price for Robin Hill by another \u00a3350. While visiting the aunts, Monty gossips and spreads the news of Irene's indiscretion.\nIrene and Bosinney consummate their relationship and have confidence that they can be together after the trial. However, as the court case nears, he is unable to secure future clients. Without work, he will be bankrupt at the end of the trial. She offers him her father's watch to fund his legal costs telling him that the watch might be for sale, but her father's memory is not.\n\n\n=== Four ===\nWhen Irene stays at Bosinney's for longer than she intended, Soames grows suspicious. June returns from a holiday in Switzerland and discovers the lawsuit. Despite his infidelity, she still supports him against Soames. Walking in the park, Irene and Bosinney run into Young Jolyon Forsyte painting a watercolor. She lies about why they are together, though Jolyon knows the truth.\nOld Jolyon goes to his brother James to withdraw his will and place it with another solicitor. He then goes to his son's house and expresses his desire to \"be a family again.\" He expects them to feel relief and gratitude at the offer, but he is told that one could be happy despite poverty. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Jolyon discuss if they should take his offer.\nIrene asks for a divorce, but Soames refuses. She is late once again coming home from Bosinney's, and in a moment of carelessness, she leaves her bedroom door unlocked. Soames comes in unannounced and rapes her. The maid hears her screaming, but can do nothing. Irene meets with Bosinney the next day and he discovers the truth. In a rage, Bosinney goes to confront Soames, but as he runs through the foggy streets, he is run over by a cab and killed.\nWhen Bosinney does not appear at his own court hearing (which he loses anyway) and he does not meet Irene at a hotel (to run away together), June and Irene go to his apartment. They have words against each other where Irene compares June to Soames, and June calls Irene a leech. Finally, Irene slaps June to stop her tirade. Old Jolyon asks June what she would think of living with her father and his family. She suggests living at Robin Hill.\nWhen Soames comes home from court, the maid tells him Irene has left with two suitcases. Old Jolyon goes to Soames and asks to buy Robin Hill from him. However, they are interrupted when a policeman asks Soames to identify Bosinney's body. Old Jolyon has to break the terrible news to June. Last to learn is Irene, who has gone to Bosinney's club in search of him. Jolyon, also a member there, breaks the news to her. Irene is obviously devastated, and Young Jolyon offers to have her stay with his family rather than return to Soames but Irene refuses, not wishing to upset June any further. He reluctantly takes her back to Soames. He is haunted by the expression on her face and regrets delivering her to Soames. Soames tries to convince her that Bosinney's death was a sign that they should be together. She goes up to her room in shock.\n\n\n=== Five ===\nThe next day, Irene leaves again, this time for good, but with only the clothes on her back. She leaves her wedding ring behind. Young Jolyon meets the male members of his family again at the club, but he and his father are repulsed by Dartie's talk of Irene's situation. In the meantime, Soames is deluded into thinking that she will return, asking his housekeeper Bilson to continue changing the flowers in her room.\nJune and her father reunite, but he feels like it is not his place to console her when she cries to her grandfather about Bosinney's funeral arrangements. The father and daughter embark on a newfound friendship, discussing Bosinney and her half-siblings. During the funeral, June berates Soames for his part in her fianc\u00e9's death. Despite her falling out with Irene, she still defends her in the context of her marriage to him. She also reveals that she knew that Irene prevented the conception of any of his children. He retorts that their friendship was a sham, and she replies, \"Yes she stole the love of my life, my future. I should hate her, but the alternative was you. I cannot hate her. I can only wonder why she didn't do it sooner.\"\nSoames' mother comes to visit her despondent son, who has taken to his bed. In the presence of his sister Winifred, he cannot speak, only cry over Irene. His mother is affectionate toward him, but she wonders if she raised a child incapable of loving another being. She mentions that when he was a boy she gave him a kitten which he smothered with his love. \"I should have taught you not to love like that ... You feel things too much, you always have.\" Soames finally gets up the next morning and appears to be fully recovered. He tells Bilson not to bother cleaning Mrs. Forsyte's room. He begins to move on with his life.\nOld Jolyon makes an offer on Robin Hill. He defends Irene to Soames' parents. \"If you talk about Irene, you do so with respect. Your son loved her once, with very good cause.\" The brothers settle that Jolyon will pay full price for the house. June gets along well with her father's family as they unpack their belongings at Robin Hill. She discovers a bundle of paintings of her father's; among them is a painting of her father she did as a child. The family toasts to \"new beginnings.\"\nFive years have passed and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has died. Old Jolyon is once again taking care of a granddaughter, this time young Holly, while the rest of the family is traveling abroad. One evening, Old Jolyon notices Irene at the opera, and a few days later on the grounds of Robin Hill. They renew their acquaintance and he invites her to give young Holly piano lessons. Irene reveals that on the night she left Soames she was on the brink of disaster when a \"lady of the night\" took her in and cared for her. She has since made a living teaching piano while giving what food and comfort she could to other such women. With June and Young Jolyon abroad, Irene and Old Jolyon see each other often. He and Irene grow close, and in his own way he falls in love with her. However, his health soon fails and he dies shortly after.\n\n\n=== Six ===\nJolyon and June return home and discover that Irene had visited before their arrival. Young Jolyon is the executor of his father's will. To the shock of the Forsytes, Old Jolyon had made a codicil to his will that leaves Irene \u00a315,000. The whole Forsyte clan attend the funeral at Robin Hill and there is gossip and speculation as to why he would bequeath money to Irene and some astonishment that he would be buried outside the family crypt. Jolyon and June discuss what has come to pass and she states that all the people she ever loved \"all gravitate to her [Irene] in the end.\"\nBeing the executor, Jolyon visits Irene to discuss the money his father left her. He becomes her trustee, and during that time, he finds himself admiring her. She comforts him as he cries about his father's death.\nTwelve years pass and everyone gathers for Soames' surprise 50th birthday party, with the exception of Jolyon's family. Winifred's children Val and Imogen are grown. Though still married to Irene, Soames has met a beautiful young French woman, Annette Lamotte. She is the waitress in a restaurant that Soames owns. Her mother is the manager. He invites them to visit his new country estate, Mapledurham. He shows off his art gallery, a collection of beautiful paintings which he seeks to own, but does not understand.\nIn the meanwhile, Dartie and his cousin-in-law George spend their time gambling and cavorting with prostitutes. He has given Winifred's pearl necklace to one of them. He embarrasses his son, Val, at the casino by stumbling about and falling down drunk. Dartie comes home after his son runs off, and his wife says that her pearls are missing. At her accusation, he reacts frantically and puts a gun to his head shouting, \"I'm lower than the servants in this house and I'm tired of it.\" However, when he pulls the trigger he finds that it was not loaded. He admits that he gave her necklace away. \"I gave them to a Spanish beauty, neck like a swan.\" After spending the night on the sofa, and in the haze of the following morning Monty decides to leave his family and go to Buenos Aires. Soames tries to convince Winifred to begin divorce proceedings, and he expresses his desire to \"start again\" as well. Winifred states that she would not like a divorce, which would humiliate her and her children. Soames visits his ill father who tells him to have a son.\nJolyon is preparing for an exhibition of his watercolors at Robin Hill. Soames comes to visit, along with Val, asking if Jolyon knew if Irene \"had any men\" as grounds for divorce. Jolyon agrees to see her if and when she returns to London. Jolyon goes to her flat and asks her if she could provide what Soames needs for a divorce, but she admits there has been no one since Bosinney; Soames should have taken his chance then, but now she cannot help him.\nIn the meantime, Val and Holly are forming an attachment and falling in love. They are unaware of the Forsyte history.\nJolyon visits Soames and tells him there is nothing he can do to facilitate a divorce.\n\nSoames: If Irene won't free the ties of our marriage, she must abide by its duties. I retain my rights.\nJolyon: Your rights? To do what?\nSoames: I've not forgotten the nickname your father gave me. \"The Man of Property!\" I'm not called names for nothing.\nJolyon: She is a human being.\nSoames: She is my wife. Irene ... Forsyte. I'll thank you to leave her alone from now on.\nJolyon: She chooses Heron.\nSoames: Do you hear me? Leave Mrs. Forsyte alone.\nJolyon: Think very carefully Soames before you try to bully her. She's not alone this time.While he forces Winifred's hand in her own divorce, once Soames believes that he must be with Irene, he does not follow his own advice to divorce and move on.\n\n\n=== Seven ===\nDespite his feelings for Annette, Soames' feelings for Irene are easily rekindled. His obsession with her returns when he sees her again, even after 12 years. He pays her an unexpected visit and wants to resume his marriage to her since she won't grant a divorce. He follows her and asks her to bear him a son. A group of \"women of the night\" save her from him, and she escapes. She consults with Young Jolyon, and they conclude that he will not rest until she grants him a divorce or gives him an heir. Irene visits Robin Hill and reveals to Jolyon that Soames had once forced himself on her. She quickly leaves for Paris to escape Soames' harassment. During their talk, Jolly overheard his father shout, \"Damn Soames Forsyte!\" Discovering his sister's romance with Val Dartie, Jolly forbids that they see each other again, prejudiced by what he overheard his father say. He tries to blackmail her into giving Val up by threatening to tell their father of the relationship.\nWinifred is humiliated in court, but quickly realizes that Soames had no intention of divorcing Irene. Soames hires a private detective to find and follow Irene, saying that he is representing a client called Heron (Irene is using her maiden name). Jolyon meets Irene in France to visit and bring her money he has collected as rent for her flat in Chelsea. There they spend time together and begin to fall in love.\nVal and Holly are secretly engaged but are discovered by Jolly. Jolly forces Val to prove his love for Holly by going with him to enlist in the Boer War.\nIn the meantime, Dartie comes home to Winifred, having run out of money.\n\n\n=== Eight ===\nHolly and June become nurses, and ship out to South Africa, where Jolly is ill with typhoid fever. Jolly dies, an event that hits Young Jolyon very hard. Soames discovers Irene and Young Jolyon together at Robin Hill just after they have learned of Jolly's death and accuses them of adultery. They are not yet lovers, but they know that without admitting guilt, Irene will never be free of Soames. Irene and Soames divorce while she and Jolyon go away together as a couple.\nVal comes home from the war along with Holly. He has been discharged after a stray bullet hit his ankle. He announces to his family that he and Holly are married and that they are moving to South Africa. Soames and Annette go to her mother's restaurant and he sees Irene is pregnant with Jolyon's child.\nSoon afterward, Soames and Annette are married and having a family party at Mapledurham at which Annette announces that she is pregnant. Soames relishes the prospect of producing an heir at last, as does his father who tells her, \"A boy, you hear me? A boy.\" Meanwhile, George reads the paper aloud, which announces that Jolyon and Irene Forsyte have had a son, Jon. At Robin Hill, June and Irene are reconciled.\nAnnette has a difficult delivery, and the doctor tells Soames to choose between saving his wife or his baby; either way, she will never bear another child. Soames believes that Annette would be devastated by the loss of the child if she were to survive, and tells the doctor to do what he can to save the child at all costs. Annette survives and they have a baby girl. He is disappointed and leaves his wife's side and go to his father, who is dying. He lies to his father and says he has had a baby boy. Soames returns home in the morning. He falls in love with his daughter immediately. Holding her in his arms, he names her Fleur.\n\n\n== Episode plots for second series ==\nThis plot summary covers the four episodes of the second series, which relate to Jon and Fleur in later life. Series Two was titled The Forsyte Saga: To Let and portrays the last book of The Forsyte Saga, To Let.\n\n\n=== Episode One ===\nNine years have passed since the events of the first series. June Forsyte (Gillian Kearney ) takes her half brother Jon on an impromptu visit to her Aunt Hester's (Ann Bell). She discovers that it is Hester's birthday and a party is being held with other members of the Forsyte family, including Soames and his daughter Fleur. The children are encouraged to play outside, and playing by a pond Fleur soils her dress with mud. Soames shouts at Jon for encouraging bad behaviour. Back at Robin Hill, Irene Forsyte is angry when Jon talks about the \"nasty man\" that yelled at him, and is disappointed that June should have exposed him to that side of the family. She hopes that he will forget the encounter quickly.\nEleven years later in 1920, June is running a fashionable gallery in London and has a new exhibition. Soames and Fleur visit the gallery, not knowing it is June's, and encounter Irene and Jon there. Irene is instantly made ill at ease with the presence of Soames, but Jon and Fleur seem to be intrigued with one another, especially upon discovering that they are, as Soames puts it, \"distant\" cousins. Irene is disturbed by the meeting and tells her husband Jolyon that Jon appeared to be \"entranced\u2019 by Fleur. He tells her not to worry, that boys of his age are fickle, and that the interest will pass.\nFleur knows that Holly Dartie (Amanda Ryan) is Jon's half-sister (and that he is currently staying at Val (Julian Ovenden) and Holly's farm). At her 18th birthday party, she invites herself to stay with them in order to meet Jon again. At the farm, when Jon is introduced to Fleur, she pretends they have not met before. She sneaks off early one morning to find Jon, who is working at the nearby farm of Mr Maple. The two connect immediately, and both wonder what secrets in their family's past have created the feud between their families.  They agree to keep their friendship a secret. However, Holly is becoming aware that something is between them, and confides in her father Jolyon and stepmother Irene, who are worried.\nMeanwhile, Soames has met returned serviceman Michael Mont (Oliver Milburn) at an art auction, where the two bid for a copy of a painting by Degas of a girl who Soames believes shares a resemblance with his daughter. Soames invites the young man to his home to see the rest of his art collection.\nMontague Dartie (Ben Miles), his son Val, cousin George (Alistair Petrie) and Jon Forsyte meet with Prosper Profond (Michael Maloney), a wealthy French Armenian who shares their interest in horse racing. Prosper starts a seemingly harmless flirtation with Monty's wife Winifred (Amanda Root). One evening, Prosper claims to have to work and cancels an evening at the opera with Winifred. Later that evening however, Monty sees Prosper leaving the opera with Soames's wife Annette.\nJolyon Forsyte visits his doctor and is told that he has a weak heart and that he should not exert himself. Despite this, Jolyon confronts Soames, telling him to use his influence over his daughter to put an end to their children's friendship before it goes any further. Soames thinks Jolyon a hypocrite, considering that he has always taken pride in following his heart.\n\n\n=== Episode Two ===\nAfter a week Fleur and Jon leave Holly and Val's farm by train, and Jon becomes jealous when he sees Michael Mont collecting Fleur by boat to take her home to Mapledurham and Irene takes Jon on holiday to Paris in order to try to prevent his and Fleur's relationship from blossoming.\nSoames and his wife, Annette (Beatriz Batarda), host a country weekend to encourage a match between Fleur and Michael; however, Fleur is pining for the loss of Jon and does not warm to Michael's advances.  While the guests are being farewelled, Fleur and her friend Cherry (Olivia Lumley) see Annette and Prosper in each other's arms in the garden and Fleur is outraged at her betrayal of Soames.\nWhile Irene and Jon are away, missing Jon, Fleur goes to Robin Hill. Jolyon does not know her true identity and invites her in for lemonade and bemoans the fact that he is missing Irene and Jon. Jolyon tells June he is ill, and Irene and Jon return home, their attempt at having him forget about Fleur having failed. He is missing her more every day and, as soon as they arrive home, the pair reunite, Fleur confessing to Jon that she visited Robin Hill in his absence.\nFleur has discovered a photograph of Irene in a frame behind one of her mother and assumes that Jolyon stole Irene from Soames, and this is the reason for the family feud.\nAfter his usual run of bad luck Monty Dartie gets onto a winning streak only to be killed in a car accident on his way home with his winnings.  At his funeral Prosper tells Fleur that her father and Jon's mother were in fact married and divorced.\nImmediately after the funeral, Fleur goes to Robin Hill to tell Jon her discovery and is forced to have tea with Irene and Jolyon, who is obviously furious at having been deceived by her when his wife and son were abroad. After an argument with his parents, Jon leaves Robin Hill and heads to one of Farmer Maple's cottages.\n\n\n=== Episode Three ===\nFleur arrives at the cottage and, though they sleep in separate beds, their love increases with Jon's estrangement from his family. While Jon is out working one day Jolyon arrives and implores Fleur to give up Jon, telling her he is ill and he needs Jon by his side more than ever.  She does not tell Jon of their conversation and, despite her assurances to Jolyon, she and Jon plan to elope to Scotland in three weeks time, where they do not need parental consent to marry.\nAn anonymous letter arrives at Mapledurham telling Soames of his wife's affair with Prosper; however she laughs it off as gossip and falsehood and continues her liaison. Soon after, however, Prosper advises that he has tired of England and is going abroad. Soames is pleased but sees how much it has hurt Annette and tries to comfort her as best he can.\nMichael Mont asks Soames to become a formal suitor for Fleur's hand and, two weeks later, the pair are invited, along with Fleur's parents, to join Winifred in her tent at the Eton-Harrow cricket match.  While there, Soames is upset at the sight of Jolyon and Irene, obviously still very much in love, and Jon and Fleur manage a rendezvous that is seen by Jolyon. Prosper arrives at the cricket match and manages to woo back Annette, and Soames angrily resigns himself to the fact that he has an unfaithful wife for a second time.\nAfter the cricket match Jolyon confesses to Irene that he is unwell, and they agree to tell Jon the truth about the past and Soames's obsession with his mother.  After this painful confession Jolyon suffers a massive heart attack and dies in the arms of his wife and son.\nAfter his family have spread his ashes on the grave of Jolyon's father, Fleur, being stood up at the train station for their elopement, arrives at Robin Hill to see Jon. Grief-stricken and emotional, Jon gives in to temptation and he and Fleur make love. The couple are caught by June who berates Jon for being so stupid and unfeeling on that day of all days.\n\n\n=== Episode Four ===\nFleur returns home and insists that nothing can prevent her and Jon from being together and convinces Soames to speak with Irene on her behalf.  The pair travel to Robin Hill but because of his parents' revelations about the past and also because he witnesses Soames's obsessive behaviour toward his mother; Jon turns Soames from the house and refuses to see Fleur who calls to Jon desperately from the garden.\nFinally Jon and Irene go out to her and she accuses Irene of trying to keep Jon \"all to herself\" claiming \"he\u2019s mine!\" It is then that Jon realises that she is like her father, and thinks of people as being possessions.  Fleur, exhausted, reluctantly goes home with her father.\nFleur, like her father when Irene left him, takes to her bed and refuses to see her father whom she blames for her disappointment, but over time is again wooed by Michael Mont and, thinking all hope lost for her and Jon, eventually agrees to an engagement.\nProsper Profond visits Robin Hill with Holly to offer Jon some work and tells him of Fleur's romance with Michael. Jon is incensed that she should so quickly take up with someone else and Prosper facilitates a meeting between them. Jon tries to convince Fleur not to marry Michael, even though he cannot bring himself to hurt his family by being with her. She accuses him of being the one to treat her like a possession and says \"If you won\u2019t have me then I\u2019ll do it my own way \u2013 and I\u2019ll forget about you Jon Forsyte \u2013 I swear I will!\"\nFleur's feud with her father continues until the day of her wedding when Soames confesses to his abuse of Irene all those years ago and laments that every time they meet Irene thinks only of that moment.  Fleur softens toward him at this revelation, convinced that it is better to be in a loveless marriage than to be exposed to heartbreak as her father was with Irene, and Michael and Fleur marry.\nSoames arrives at Robin Hill and there is a \"to let\" sign on the front gate.  He has come to give the Degas copy that resembles Fleur to Jon.  Both he and Irene question whether parting the young lovers was the right thing to do and admit that they miss the company of their children \u2013 Jon is abroad and Fleur on her honeymoon. They part with a handshake.  When Parfit, the butler, asks what the visitor wanted Irene responds with surprise \"He didn\u2019t want anything.\"\n\n\n== Differences from the novels ==\nThe main differences between the serialisation of The Forsyte Saga and To Let and the Galsworthy novels are as follows:\nTiming\nThe timing of the events in the series and novel differ considerably. The novel begins in 1886 and the series begins in 1874. The writers of the series understood how difficult it would be to present the series in the order that events take place in the novel. Producer Sita Williams stated that, \"The novels actually start with the engagement of June to Bosinney, in the middle of the story. You learn about Soames' wooing of Irene and about Young Jolyon's affair with the governess, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, through the gossip and memories of the other characters. It's great for a novel, but not for TV. This isn't like adapting Dickens, who wrote perfect, straightforward, linear narratives. Galsworthy is more complicated than that. So we had to look at the back story and tease out the important things and put them on screen.\"Irene\nIn the novels, the character of Irene is rather mysterious. She has no voice within the narrative and is described only by her effect on the characters around her. In the series, the character of Irene is far more complex and the viewer is able to form a more personal relationship with the character and more readily sympathise with her. In the novel, Irene is described more than once as having fair hair and dark eyes, this physical appearance being key to her particular brand of her attractiveness to nearly all the men in the novels. Actress Gina McKee, who portrayed Irene in the series, did not. This mattered little to director Christopher Menaul, who said, \"The hardest part of casting was the search for Irene. She's an elusive character - even Galsworthy admitted that he'd drawn her in shadows, that she presented a different facade to every character in the book.\"\nForsyte siblings\nThe early novels put more emphasis on the older generations of Forsytes. All 10 of the older Forsyte siblings feature in the novels, which include several chapters devoted to Timothy (Afternoon at Timothy's, Timothy Prophecies) who shares his house on the Bayswater Road with his sisters Ann, Hester and Mrs. Small (Aunt Juley). Roger (George Forsyte's father) features in the novel, as do the other Forsyte siblings, Nicholas and Susan, none of whom appear in the television series. Much of the dialogue of the older generation and their Victorian sensibilities are an ironic counterbalance to the new, younger generation of Forsytes and the sometimes scandalous and dramatic events in their lives. Many other characters such as George Forsyte's siblings Francie and Eustace, and Nicholas's children Young Nicholas and Euphemia, are also not featured in the television series. Imogen Dartie features briefly in the early television episodes and is not seen again in the later series. Her presence is much greater in the novels.\nWriter Jan McVerry explained that there were tough decisions to be made and that many of the secondary characters had to be omitted from the series. \"We were concentrating on the strongest stories,\" she said \"We went through the novels and decided which episodes were going into the script and which weren't. You have to do that with any adaptation: you can't represent every incidental character or you'd go on for thousands of hours and bore everyone to death. This is drama and you have to pare it down a bit.\"Other differences include:\nThe interlude Indian Summer of a Forsyte, which takes place in the summer of 1892, describes the rekindling of Old Jolyon and Irene's relationship (parts of which are featured in Episode Four of the 2002 television series). In the novel H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is abroad with Young Jolyon and June at that time and dies in 1894; in the series she has already died.\nBosinney's death is the background of the novel but is vividly displayed on screen in the series. More contact with his Aunt Baines, including a trip to Wales to visit her during his engagement to June, is featured in the novels.\nSimilarly, the rape of Irene by Soames in the fourth episode of the series is only mentioned in the novel as the opening lines of the chapter entitled Voyage into the Inferno, the fourth chapter of The Man of Property: \"The morning after a certain night on which Soames last asserted his rights and acted like a man, he breakfasted alone.\" This event, quite overlooked by the novel in some respects, features as a major catalyst that ultimately determines the future of many of the characters in the television adaptation.\nIn the novel, Jolly and Val meet while both at Oxford and it is Young Jolyon and Holly's visit there that begins Holly and Val's relationship. In the series, Holly and Val's meeting takes place at Robin Hill just as Jolly has left for the university, and it is combined with Soames' first approach to Jolyon, as Irene's trustee, to find out if there is evidence for him to undertake divorce proceedings.\nIrene does not visit Robin Hill to tell Young Jolyon of Soames approaching her to resume their marriage in the novel, nor does Soames attempt to approach her in the street while Irene is assisting her \"ladies of the night\" as depicted in the series; rather, Young Jolyon visits Irene several times and meets Soames in the street when he has been at Irene's flat in Chelsea and his discovery is made there.\nThe character of Montague Dartie continues on into the second To Let series but does not appear in the novels. It is stated in the series of novels that Monty's death occurs in 1913, seven years before the To Let events occur.\nIn the novel, Irene and June resume their friendship prior to Young Jolyon and Irene becoming romantically involved. Their reunion is delayed in the series until after the birth of their son Jon, at the end of the last episode.\nIn To Let, Michael Mont meets Soames in June Forsyte's Cork Street Gallery, not at an auction, and this occurs moments before Fleur and Jon have their first encounter. The series shows a meeting of Jon and Fleur at the home of June's Aunts on Hester's birthday when they are both around nine years old, but this is not described in the novel.\nThe series shows Fleur going incognito to Robin Hill and making the acquaintance of Young Jolyon under a false name, thereby providing an excuse for Young Jolyon to behave angrily toward her later and to provide evidence to his son that she is not to be trusted. This does not occur in the novels.\nThe painting of the girl in the hat by Degas is not a feature of the novel. It is a painting by Goya that is mentioned several times but a painting does not feature in Irene and Soames' later meeting in the novel.\nIn the novel To Let, Jon Forsyte is provided the information regarding his mother's past relationship to and ultimate violation by Soames in a letter written by his father. Those revelations are provided by his father face to face, together with Irene, in the series. This conversation does not, in the novel, immediately precede Young Jolyon's death (though it comes soon after) and it is Jon, not Irene, who learns of his illness first.\nIn the novels, Jon and Fleur do not have a sexual encounter during their initial romance. In a later Galsworthy novel, Swan Song, Fleur wishes she had trapped Jon into marriage by sleeping with him and being \"compromised,\" and later Jon and Fleur do have a one-night stand, while both married to other people, many years after events of To Let take place.\nIn the novels, the character of Aunt Hester dies in 1907, but in the series she's still alive in 1920.\nThe scene between Soames and Fleur on her wedding day that includes his confession about his grand passion for Irene and his lingering regret at what happened between them does not occur in the novels.\nThe character of Prosper Profond is less important to the events that occur in the novels. In contrast, in the series he is quite prominent, being instrumental to the lives of some characters and often behaves in a rather clownish manner which is in contrast to the rather shadowy figure he is depicted as in the novels.\nAt the end of the novel, Jon Forsyte goes to work in British Columbia, rather than in New York as the series suggests. In the novel, his mother Irene joins him, but this is not made clear in the series.\nFinally, the handshake that takes place between Irene and Soames in the last scene of the television series does not occur in the novel. In the novel, it is Soames who refuses Irene's hand but this scene takes place in the gallery, not at Robin Hill, and some time later than the series depicts.\n\n\n== Response ==\nCritical response was positive overall. Maclean's gave the series a glowing review. TIME magazine gave the production a tepid review, calling it \"lush, well acted--and stale\". People magazine proclaimed it the \"Show of the Week\" and called Lewis' performance \"a constant marvel\".\n\n\n== DVD releases ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== General references ===\nGalsworthy, John (2002).

        "wiki": "Granada ( gr\u0259-NAH-d\u0259, Spanish: [\u0261\u027ea\u02c8na\u00f0a]) , locally [\u0261\u027ea\u02c8na] is the capital city of the province of Granada, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. Granada is located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the confluence of four rivers, the Darro, the Genil, the Monachil and the Beiro. It sits at an average elevation of 738 m (2,421 ft) above sea level, yet is only one hour by car from the Mediterranean coast, the Costa Tropical. Nearby is the Sierra Nevada Ski Station, where the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 were held.\nIn the 2005 national census, the population of the city of Granada proper was 236,982, and the population of the entire urban area was estimated to be 472,638, ranking as the 13th-largest urban area of Spain. About 3.3% of the population did not hold Spanish citizenship, the largest number of these people (31%; or 1% of the total population) coming from South America. Its nearest airport is Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca Granada-Ja\u00e9n Airport.\nThe Alhambra, an Arab citadel and palace, is located in Granada. It is the most renowned building of the Islamic historical legacy with its many cultural attractions and architectural elements that make Granada a popular destination among the tourist cities of Spain. The Almohad influence on architecture is also preserved in the Granada neighborhood called the Albaic\u00edn with its fine examples of Moorish and Morisco construction.  Granada is also well-known within Spain for the University of Granada which has an estimated 82,000 students spread over five different campuses in the city.  The pomegranate (in Spanish, granada) is the heraldic device of Granada.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Umayyad history ===\n\nThe region surrounding what today is Granada has been populated since at least 5500 BC and experienced Roman and Visigothic influences. The most ancient ruins found in the city belong to an Iberian oppidum called Ilturir, in the region known as Bastetania. This oppidum eventually changed its name to Iliberri, and after the Roman conquest of Iberia, to Municipium Florentinum Iliberitanum.\n\n\n=== Founding and early history ===\n\nThe Umayyad conquest of Hispania, starting in AD 711, brought large parts of the Iberian Peninsula under Moorish control and established al-Andalus. Granada's historical name in the Arabic language was \u063a\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0629 (\u0120arn\u0101\u1e6dah). The word G\u00e1rnata (or Karnatah) possibly means \"hill of strangers\". Because the city was situated on a low plain and, as a result, difficult to protect from attacks, the ruler decided to transfer his residence to the higher situated area of G\u00e1rnata. According to Arabic sources Ilbira (Elvira) was razed during Fitna of al-Andalus, afterwards it was not restored at its previous place and instead Garnata, which was a Jewish ghetto before, replaced it as the main city. In a short time this town was transformed into one of the most important cities of al-Andalus.In the early 11th century, after the collapse of the Umayyad Caliphate, the Berber Zawi ben Ziri established an independent kingdom for himself, the Taifa of Granada. His surviving memoirs \u2013 the only ones for the Spanish \"Middle Ages\" \u2013 provide considerable detail for this brief period. The Zirid Taifa of Granada was a Jewish state in all but name; the Muslim king is looked upon as a mainly symbolic figurehead. It was the center of Jewish Sephardi culture and scholarship.\n\nEarly Arabic writers repeatedly called it \"Garnata al-Yahud\" (Granada of the Jews).... Granada was in the eleventh century the center of Sephardic civilization at its peak, and from 1027 until 1066 Granada was a powerful Jewish state. Jews did not hold the foreigner (dhimmi) status typical of Islamic rule. Samuel ibn Nagrilla, recognized by Sephardic Jews everywhere as the quasi-political ha-Nagid ('The Prince'), was king in all but name. As vizier he made policy and\u2014much more unusual\u2014led the army.... It is said that Samuel's strengthening and fortification of Granada was what permitted it, later, to survive as the last Islamic state in the Iberian peninsula.\nAll of the greatest figures of eleventh-century Hispano-Jewish culture are associated with Granada. Moses Ibn Ezra was from Granada; on his invitation Judah ha-Levi spent several years there as his guest. Ibn Gabirol\u2019s patrons and hosts were the Jewish viziers of Granada, Samuel ha-Nagid and his son Joseph.\nWhen Joseph took over after his father's death, he proved to lack his father's diplomacy, bringing on the 1066 Granada massacre, which ended the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain.\nBy the end of the 11th century, the city had spread across the Darro to reach the hill of the future Alhambra, and included the Albaic\u00edn neighborhood (now a World Heritage site). The Almoravids ruled Granada from 1090 and the Almohad dynasty from 1166.\n\n\n=== Nasrid dynasty\u2014Emirate of Granada ===\n\nIn 1228, with the departure of the Almohad prince Idris al-Ma'mun, who left Iberia to take the Almohad leadership, the ambitious Ibn al-Ahmar established the last and longest reigning Muslim dynasty in the Iberian peninsula, the Nasrids. With the Reconquista in full swing after the conquest of C\u00f3rdoba in 1236, the Nasrids aligned themselves with Fernando III of Castile, officially becoming the Emirate of Granada in 1238. Most historians agree that Granada became a tributary state to the Kingdom of Castile from that year, although this was often interrupted by wars between the two states. It provided connections with Muslim and Arab trade centers, particularly for gold from sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb, and exported silk and dried fruits produced in the area. The Nasrids also supplied troops from the Emirate and mercenaries from North Africa for service to Castile.\nIbn Battuta, a famous traveller and an authentic historian, visited the Kingdom of Granada in 1350. He described it as a powerful and self-sufficient kingdom in its own right, although frequently embroiled in skirmishes with the Kingdom of Castile. In his journal, Ibn Battuta called Granada the \"metropolis of Andalusia and the bride of its cities.\"During the Moor rule, Granada was a city with adherents to many religions and ethnicities (Arabs, Berbers, Christians and Jews) who lived in separate quarters. During this Nasrid period there were 137 Muslim mosques in the Medina (city) of Granada.\n\n\n=== Reconquista and the 16th century ===\n\nOn January 2, 1492, the last Muslim ruler in Iberia, Emir Muhammad XII of Granada, known as \"Boabdil\" to the Spanish, surrendered complete control of the Emirate of Granada to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, Los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos (\"the Catholic Monarchs\"), after the last battle of the Granada War.\nThe 1492 surrender of the Kingdom of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs is one of the most significant events in Granada's history as it marks the completion of the Reconquista. The terms of the surrender, expressed in the Alhambra Decree treaty, explicitly allowed the city's Muslim inhabitants, known as Mud\u00e9jars, to continue unmolested in the practice of their faith and customs. By 1499, however, Cardinal Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros grew frustrated with the slow pace of the efforts of the first archbishop of Granada, Hernando de Talavera, to convert non-Christians to Christianity and undertook a program of forced Christian baptisms, creating the Converso (convert) class for Muslims and Jews. Cisneros's new tactics, which were a direct violation of the terms of the treaty, provoked the Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1499\u20131501) centered in the rural Alpujarras region southwest of the city.\nResponding to the rebellion of 1501, the Castilian Crown rescinded the Alhambra Decree treaty, and mandated that Granada's Muslims convert or emigrate. Under the 1492 Alhambra Decree, Spain's Jewish population, unlike the Muslims, had already been forced to convert under threat of expulsion or even execution, becoming Marranos (meaning \"pigs\" in Spanish), or Catholics of Jewish descent. Many of the elite Muslim class subsequently emigrated to North Africa. The majority of the Granada's Mud\u00e9jar Muslims converted so that they could stay, however, becoming Moriscos, or Catholics of Moorish descent (\"Moor\" being equivalent to Muslim). Both populations of conversos were subject to persecution, execution, or exile, and each had cells that practiced their original religion in secrecy.\nOver the course of the 16th century, Granada took on an ever more Catholic and Castilian character, as immigrants came to the city from other parts of the Iberian Peninsula. The city's mosques were converted to Christian churches or completely destroyed. New structures, such as the cathedral and the Chanciller\u00eda, or Royal Court of Appeals, transformed the urban landscape. After the 1492 Alhambra decree, which resulted in the majority of Granada's Jewish population being expelled, the Jewish quarter (ghetto) was demolished to make way for new Catholic and Castilian institutions and uses.\n\n\n==== Legacy ====\n\nThe fall of Granada has a significant place among the important events that mark the latter half of the Spanish 15th century. It completed the so-called \"Reconquista\" (or Christian reconquest) of the almost 800-year-long Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula. Spain, now without any major internal territorial conflict, embarked on a great phase of exploration and colonization around the globe. In the same year, the sailing expedition of Christopher Columbus resulted in what is usually claimed to be the first European sighting of the New World, although Leif Erikson is often regarded as the first European to land in the New World, 500 years before Christopher Columbus. The resources of the Americas enriched the crown and the country, allowing Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand to consolidate their rule as Catholic Monarchs of the united kingdoms. Subsequent conquests, and the Spanish colonization of the Americas by the maritime expeditions they commissioned, created the vast Spanish Empire: for a time, the largest in the world.\n\n\n== Heritage and monuments ==\nThe greatest artistic wealth of Granada is its Spanish-Islamic art \u2013 in particular, the compound of the Alhambra and the Generalife. The Generalife is a pleasure palace with attached romantic gardens, remarkable both for its location and layout, as well as for the diversity of its flowers, plants and fountains. The Alhambra is the architectural culmination of the works of Nasrid art that were undertaken in the 13th and 14th centuries, with most of the Alhambra having been built at the time of Yusuf I and Mohammed V, between 1333 and 1354.\nAt present, the buildings of Granada are typically bourgeois in appearance, with much of the architecture dating from the 19th Century, together with numerous Renaissance and Baroque buildings.\n\n\n=== Alhambra ===\n\nThe Alhambra is a Nasrid \"palace city\". It was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1984. It is certainly Granada's most emblematic monument and one of the most visited in Spain. It consists of a defensive zone, the Alcazaba, together with others of a residential and formal state character, the Nasrid Palaces and, lastly, the palace, gardens and orchards of the Generalife.\nThe Alhambra occupies a small plateau on the southeastern border of the city in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada above the Assabica valley. Some of the buildings may have existed before the arrival of the Moors. The Alhambra as a whole is completely walled, bordered to the north by the valley of the Darro, to the south by the al-Sabika, and to the east of the Cuesta del Rey Chico, which in turn is separated from the Albaic\u00edn and Generalife, located in the Cerro del Sol.\nIn the 11th century the Castle of the Alhambra was developed as a walled town which became a military stronghold that dominated the whole city. But it was in the 13th century, with the arrival of the first monarch of the Nasrid dynasty, Muhammad I of Granada (Mohammed I, 1238\u20131273), that the royal residence was established in the Alhambra. This marked the beginning of its heyday. The Alhambra became palace, citadel and fortress, and was the residence of the Nasrid sultans and their senior officials, including servants of the court and elite soldiers (13th\u201314th centuries).\nIn 1492 the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabela, expelled the final Moors from the city of Granada. They established permanent residency in the Alhambra, and it was here that Christopher Columbus requested royal endorsement for his westward expedition that year.\nIn 1527 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor demolished part of the architectural complex to build the Palace which bears his name. Although the Catholic Monarchs had already altered some rooms of the Alhambra after the conquest of the city in 1492, Charles V wanted to construct a permanent residence befitting an emperor. Around 1537 he ordered the construction of the Peinador de la Reina, or Queen's dressing room, where his wife Isabel lived, over the Tower of Abu l-Hayyay.\n\nThere was a pause in the ongoing maintenance of the Alhambra from the 18th century for almost a hundred years, and during control by the First French Empire, substantial portions of the fortress were blown apart. The repair, restoration and conservation that continues to this day did not begin until the 19th century. The complex currently includes the Museum of the Alhambra, with objects mainly from the site of the monument itself and the Museum of Fine Arts.\n\n\n=== Generalife ===\n\nThe Generalife is a garden area attached to the Alhambra which became a place of recreation and rest for the Granadan Muslim kings when they wanted to flee the tedium of official life in the Palace. It occupies the slopes of the hill Cerro del Sol above the ravines of the Genil and the Darro and is visible from vantage points throughout the city. It was conceived as a rural village, consisting of landscaping, gardens and architecture. The palace and gardens were built during the reign of Muhammed III (1302\u20131309) and redecorated shortly after by Abu l-Walid Isma'il (1313\u20131324). It is of the Islamic Nasrid style, and is today one of the biggest attractions in the city of Granada. The Generalife was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984.\nIt is difficult to know the original appearance of the Generalife, as it has been subject to modifications and reconstructions throughout the Christian period which disfigured many of its former aspects. All buildings of the Generalife are of solid construction, and the overall decor is austere and simple. There is little variety to the Alhambra's decorative plaster, but the aesthetic is tasteful and extremely delicate. In the last third of the 20th century, a part of the garden was destroyed to build an auditorium.\n\n\n=== Cathedral ===\n\nThe cathedral of Granada is built over the Nasrid Great Mosque of Granada, in the centre of the city. Its construction began during the Spanish Renaissance in the early 16th century, shortly after the conquest of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs, who commissioned the works to Juan Gil de Honta\u00f1\u00f3n and Enrique Egas. Numerous grand buildings were built in the reign of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, so that the cathedral is contemporary to the Christian palace of the Alhambra, the University and the Real Chanciller\u00eda (Supreme Court).\nThe church was conceived on the model of the Cathedral of Toledo, for what initially was a Gothic architectural project, as was customary in Spain in the early decades of the 16th century. However, Egas was relieved by the Catholic hierarchy in 1529, and the continuation of the work was assigned to Diego Siloe, who built upon the example of his predecessor, but changed the approach towards a fully Renaissance aesthetic.The architect drew new Renaissance lines for the whole building over the gothic foundations, with an ambulatory and five naves instead of the usual three. Over time, the bishopric continued to commission new architectural projects of importance, such as the redesign of the main fa\u00e7ade, undertaken in 1664 by Alonso Cano (1601\u20131667) to introduce Baroque elements. In 1706 Francisco de Hurtado Izquierdo and later his collaborator Jos\u00e9 Bada built the current tabernacle of the cathedral.\nHighlights of the church's components include the main chapel, where may be found the praying statues of the Catholic Monarchs, which consists of a series of Corinthian columns with the entablature resting on their capitals, and the vault over all. The spaces of the walls between the columns are perforated by a series of windows. The design of the tabernacle of 1706 preserves the classic proportions of the church, with its multiple columns crossing the forms of Diego de Silo\u00e9.\n\n\n=== Royal Chapel ===\n\nThe Catholic Monarchs chose the city of Granada as their burial site by a royal decree dated September 13, 1504. The Royal Chapel of Granada, built over the former terrace of the Great Mosque, ranks with other important Granadan buildings such as the Lonja and the Catedral e Iglesia del Sagrario. In it are buried the Catholic Monarchs, their daughter Joanna of Castile (Juana la Loca) and her husband Felipe I (Felipe el Hermoso). Construction of the Chapel started in 1505, directed by its designer, Enrique Egas. Built in several stages, the continuing evolution of its design joined Gothic construction and decoration with Renaissance ideals, as seen in the tombs and the 17th and 18th century Granadan art in the Chapel of Santa Cruz. Over the years the church acquired a treasury of works of art, liturgical objects and relics.\nThe Royal Chapel was declared a Historic Artistic Monument on May 19, 1884, taking consideration of BIC (Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural) status in the current legislation of Spanish Historical Heritage (Law 16/1985 of 25 June). The most important parts of the chapel are its main retable, grid and vault. In the Sacristy-Museum is the legacy of the Catholic Monarchs. Its art gallery is highlighted by works of the Flemish, Italian and Spanish schools.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Albayz\u00edn ===\n\nThe Albayz\u00edn (or Albaic\u00edn) is a neighborhood of Al-Andalus origin, much visited by tourists who flock to the city because of its historical associations, architecture, and landscape.\nThe archeological findings in the area show that it has been inhabited since ancient times. It became more relevant with the arrival of the Zirid dynasty, in 1013, when it was surrounded by defensive walls. It is one of the ancient centres of Granada, like the Alhambra, the Realejo and the Arrabal de Bib-Rambla, in the flat part of the city. Its current extension runs from the walls of the Alcazaba to the cerro of San Miguel and on the other hand, from the Puerta de Guadix to the Alcazaba.\nThis neighborhood had its greatest development in the Nasrid era, and therefore largely maintains the urban fabric of this period, with narrow streets arranged in an intricate network that extends from the upper area, called San Nicol\u00e1s, to the river Darro and Calle Elvira, located in the Plaza Nueva. The traditional type of housing is the carmen granadino, consisting of a free-standing house surrounded by a high wall that separates it from the street and includes a small orchard or garden.\nIn the Muslim era the Albayz\u00edn was characterized as the locus of many revolts against the caliphate. At that time it was the residence of craftsmen, industrialists and aristocrats. With the Christian reconquest, it would progressively lose its splendor. The Christians built churches and settled there the Real Chanciller\u00eda. During the rule of Felipe II of Spain, after the rebellion and subsequent expulsion of the Moors, the district was depopulated. In 1994 it was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site. Of its architectural wealth among others include the Ziri walls of the Alcazaba Cadima, the Nasrid walls, the towers of the Alcazaba, the churches of Salvador (former main mosque), San Crist\u00f3bal, San Miguel Alto and the Real Chanciller\u00eda.\n\n\n=== Sacromonte ===\n\nThe Sacromonte neighbourhood is located on the Valpara\u00edso hill, one of several hills that make up Granada. This neighborhood is known as the old neighbourhood of the Romani, who settled in Granada after the conquest of the city. It is one of the most picturesque neighborhoods, full of whitewashed caves cut into the rock and used as residences. The sound of strumming guitars may still be heard there in the performance of flamenco cantes and quej\u00edos, so that over time it has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in Granada.\nAt the top of this hill is the Abbey of Sacromonte and the College of Sacromonte, founded in the 17th century by the then Archbishop of Granada Pedro de Castro. The Abbey of Sacromonte was built to monitor and guard the alleged relics of the evangelists of Baetica. Those are of questionable authenticity, but since their finding the area has been a religious pilgrimage destination.The abbey complex consists of the catacombs, the abbey (17th\u201318th centuries), the Colegio Viejo de San Dionisio Areopagita (17th century) and the Colegio Nuevo (19th century). The interior of the church is simple and small but has numerous excellent works of art, which accentuate the size and rich carving of the Crucificado de Risue\u00f1o, an object of devotion for the Romani people, who sing and dance in the procession of Holy Week. The facilities also include a museum, which houses the works acquired by the Foundation.\n\n\n=== Charterhouse ===\n\nThe Charterhouse of Granada is a monastery of cloistered monks, located in what was a farm or Muslim almunia called Aynadamar (\"fountain of tears\") that had an abundance of water and fruit trees. The initiative to build the monastery in that place was begun by Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, known as El Gran Capit\u00e1n. The charterhouse was founded in 1506; construction started ten years later, and continued for the following 300 years.\nThe Monastery suffered heavy damage during the Peninsular War and lost considerable property in 1837 as a result of the confiscations of Mendiz\u00e1bal. Currently, the monastery belongs to the Carthusians, reporting directly to the Archdiocese of Granada.The street entrance to the complex is an ornate arch of Plateresque style. Through it one reaches a large courtyard, at the end which is a wide staircase leading to the entrance of the church. The church, of early 16th century style and plan, has three entrances, one for the faithful and the other two for monks and clergy. Its plan has a single nave divided into four sections, highlighting the retables of Juan S\u00e1nchez Cot\u00e1n and the chancel's glass doors, adorned with mother-of-pearl, silver, rare woods and ivory. The presbytery is covered by elliptical vaulting. The main altar, between the chancel arch and the church tabernacle, is gilded wood.\nThe church's tabernacle and sancta sanctorum are considered a masterpiece of Baroque Spanish art in its blend of architecture, painting and sculpture. The dome that covers this area is decorated with frescoes by the C\u00f3rdoba artist Antonio Palomino (18th century) representing the triumph of the Church Militant, faith, and religious life.\nThe courtyard, with galleries of arches on Doric order columns opening on it, is centered by a fountain. The Chapter House of Legos is the oldest building of the monastery (1517). It is rectangular and covered with groin vaulting.Mosque of Granada\nThe Mosque of Granada was inaugurated in 2003 on the summit of the neighborhood of Albayzin. The mosque was built near the Church of San Salvador and the Church of San Nicol\u00e1s. The Church of San Salvador was built on the site of the Great Mosque of Albayzin. The Society for the Return of Islam in Spain purchased the site in 1981, but it took many years for the plans to be approved. The mosque's initial funding was supplied by Shaykh 'Abdalqadir as-Sufi al-Murabit who envisioned providing Granada's new Spanish Muslim community with a mosque. Additional funding came from Malaysia, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. In 1991 the CIE (Comunidad Isl\u00e1mica en Espa\u00f1a) hired the architect Renato Ramirez Sanchez to design the mosque. In the 1990s, there was a heated debate pertaining to the design of the minaret. Construction eventually began in 2001. The mosque now serves about 500 people.\n\n\n=== Palace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar ===\nThe Palace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar was built in one of the most emblematic streets of Granada, the Carrera del Darro, at number 5. This place is an architectural example of the classical Granada during the Renaissance transformation of the XVIth century. It was built by the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar, great-grandson of both Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez del Pulgar (known by the name of El de la Haza\u00f1as [The One of the Valiant Deeds]) and Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (El Gran Capit\u00e1n [The Great Captain]), Captain-General of the Castilian-Aragonese forces that concluded the Reconquest of the peninsula. The palace is now the museum of perfumes El Patio de los Perfumes, with 1,500 square metres (16,000 sq ft) of floor space on two floors and 130 square metres (1,400 sq ft) of patio to relax surrounded by flowers and perfumes.\n\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nMonasterio de San Jer\u00f3nimo: monastery\nSan Juan de Dios Hospital\nCastril Palace\nMuseo de Bellas Artes de Granada\nMadrasah of Granada\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area of Granada ===\nGranada's metropolitan area consists of about fifty municipalities and the capital. Although it is not formally constituted as a political and administrative body, there are several public services that are combined. The arrival of many inhabitants of the capital and other towns in the province, influences a large Population growth. Despite the fact that the capital loses inhabitants, who move to neighboring towns. The main causes of the exodus towards the towns of the metropolitan area are, mainly, the difficulty of accessing a home in the capital because of the high prices it has and labor reasons, because in the towns of the periphery the majority are being located of industrial estates.\n\n\n=== Capital of Granada Province ===\nThe city of Granada is the capital of the province of the same name, thus all administrative entities of provincial scope dependent on the regional government and the state are located there. There is a provincial delegation from each of the governmental departments to the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, coordinated by a government delegate under the Ministry of the Interior. The national government of Spain has a sub-delegation in Granada, subordinate to the government delegate in the autonomous community.\n\n\n=== Judicial administration ===\nThe headquarters of the Superior Court of Justice of Andalusia, Ceuta and Melilla is in Granada, located in Plaza Nueva, in the building of the historic Royal Chancery, as well as the Superior Prosecutor's Office of Andalusia, located in the building of the Bank of Spain. It has a Provincial Court, located in Corteza del Carmen Street, and is also head of the Judicial Party No. 3 of the province, whose demarcation includes the city and 49 towns, some of them very populated, in the metropolitan area region.\nMost of the courts are located in two administrative buildings, in Plaza Nueva and Avenida del Sur. The set of judicial bodies is as follows: \n\nSuperior Court of Justice: President. Civil-Criminal Chamber. Contentious-Administrative Room. Social room.\nProvincial Court: President. Criminal: 2; Civil: 3\nCourts\n\n\n=== Municipal organization ===\nIts political administration is carried out through a City Council, of democratic management, whose components are chosen every four years by universal suffrage. The electoral roll is composed of all residents registered in Granada over 18 years of age, of Spanish nationality and of the other member countries of the European Union. According to the provisions of the General Electoral Regime Law, which establishes the number of eligible councilors according to the population of the municipality, the Municipal Corporation of Granada is made up of 27 councilors. In the municipal elections held in 2019 the constitution of the City Council was eleven councilors belonging to the Popular Party, eight to the Socialist Party, four belonging to Citizens Party, three to Vamos, Granada and one to the United Left-Socialist Alternative-For the People. After these results with the rise of the new political forces, PP and PSOE lost power; and after negotiations an agreement was reached with which Jos\u00e9 Torres Hurtado, mayor of the Popular Party, continues as mayor, under the supervision of the regeneration compliance required by the Citizens party. After his resignation, due to his involvement in Operation Serrallo / Nazar\u00ed, the socialist Francisco Cuenca was appointed mayor.\n\n\n=== Municipal districts and neighborhoods ===\nThe municipality of Granada consists of eight districts whose population is distributed in the attached chart according to the 2009 census of the City of Granada. These districts formed a set of 36 neighborhoods. All boundaries of districts and neighborhoods were modified in February 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal service areas ===\nThe municipal government team has organized the distribution of management responsibilities, structuring itself in the following service areas: Weddings and Palaces, Equal opportunities, Economy, Education, Communication office, Unified license management, Youth, Environment, Municipal Office of Consumer Information, Citizen Participation, Group of Civil Protection Volunteers, Local Police.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n\n=== Realejo ===\nRealejo was the Jewish district in the time of the Nasrid Granada. (The centuries since the Jewish population were so important that Granada was known in Al-Andalus under the name of \"Granada of the Jews\", Arabic: \u063a\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648\u062f\u200e Gharn\u0101\u1e6dah al-Yah\u016bd.) It is today a district made up of many Granadinian villas, with gardens opening onto the streets, called Los C\u00e1rmenes.\n\n\n=== Cartuja ===\nThis district contains the Carthusian monastery of the same name: Cartuja. This is an old monastery started in a late Gothic style with Baroque exuberant interior decorations. In this district also, many buildings were created with the extension of the University of Granada.\n\n\n=== Bib-Rambla ===\nThe toponym derives from a gate (Bab al-Ramla, or the Gate of the Ears) that was built when Granada was controlled by the Nasrid dynasty. Nowadays, Bib-Rambla is a high point for gastronomy, especially in its terraces of restaurants, open on beautiful days. The Arab bazaar (Alcaicer\u00eda) is made up of several narrow streets, which start from this place and continue as far as the cathedral\n\n\n=== Sacromonte ===\n\nThe Sacromonte neighborhood is located on the extension of the hill of Albaic\u00edn, along the Darro River. This area, which became famous by the nineteenth century for its predominantly Gitano inhabitants, is characterized by cave houses, which are dug into the hillside. The area has a reputation as a major center of flamenco song and dance, including the Zambra Gitana, an Andalusian dance originating in the Middle East. The zone is a protected cultural environment under the auspices of the Centro de Interpretaci\u00f3n del Sacromonte, a cultural center dedicated to the preservation of Gitano cultural forms.\n\n\n=== Zaid\u00edn ===\n\nThis formerly blue collar but now upmarket neighborhood houses 100,000 residents of Granada, making it the largest neighborhood or 'barrio'. Traditionally populated by Romani people, now many residents are from North and West Africa, China, and many South American countries. Every Saturday morning it hosts a large outdoor market or \"mercadillo\", where many people come and sell their wares of fruits and vegetables, clothes and shoes, and other odds and ends.\n\n\n== Gastronomy ==\nThe gastronomy of Granada is part of the Arabic-Andalusian cuisine tradition, with a strong Arab and Jewish heritage, which is reflected in its condiments and spices, such as cumin, coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon, raisins, almonds or honey. The writer Miguel Alcobendas, author of the traditional cuisine of Granada, says that it has its origin in living together, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century (when Granada surrendered to the Catholic Kings), of Muslims, Jews and Christians in the Nasrid Kingdom from Granada. Subsequently there was a miscegenation with the kitchen of the Christians, in which the pork acquired an importance in the kitchen of Granada more than in the rest of Spain, since its consumption allowed its eaters to demonstrate a certain distance from the persecuted religions, since both Muslims and Jews have it banned.\nThe climatic differences of the different regions of the province, from the coast to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada propitiates a great variety of raw materials: vegetables], meats and sausages, fish that are combined in a multitude of dishes and recipes for soups and stews.\nThe famous and reputed Trev\u00e9lez ham comes from the Sierra of Granada, to which other pork derivatives are added, sausages such as chorizo, black pudding and pork tenderloin.\nHam and beans, two products of the land, are combined in one of its most typical dishes, beans with ham; Other known dishes are the Sacromonte tortilla, which among other ingredients must have cooked brains and veal crustaillas, chopped and sauted before mixing with the egg. It is also worth mentioning \"papas a lo pobre\", potatoes which are usually served with egg and fried peppers, as well as with pieces of pork or ham.\nAmong the stews and potajes, the pot of San Ant\u00f3n stands out, which is eaten mainly towards the second half of January; cabbage stew, which combines vegetables and legumes; the stew of green beans and fennel; The thistle and pumpkin casserole, with noodles and aromatic herbs, or gypsy pottery are other dishes of the land. \nConfectionery is well represented in the gastronomy of Granada, for sweets prepared by the nuns can be purchased in the numerous convents of the city: the pesti\u00f1os of V\u00e9lez or those of the Encarnaci\u00f3n, the puff pastries of San Jer\u00f3nimo, the moles of San Ant\u00f3n eggs, the Zafra biscuit, sweet potato rolls, cocas, roscos from Santo Tomas and mantecados. Aljoj\u00e1banas, honey and cheese dumplings and some of the fritters called almohados, as well as fig bread, Moorish roscos and an almond cake called soy\u00e1 are all of Arabic heritage. \nUnlike in other provinces of Andalusia, in Granada tapas (appetizers or snacks) are usually free in bars and restaurants. \"Bar hopping\" (Ir de tapas) and eating tapas in the time between finishing work and having dinner is a deeply rooted traditional activity among the people of Granada. There are different tapas routes around the city.\n\n\n== Leisure and entertainment ==\nIn Granada there is a wide program of leisure and entertainment, which covers a large number of fields, available to both visitors and citizens themselves. Of the leisure activities carried out, the following can be highlighted: \n\nThe zambras of Sacromonte. Old bridal parties held by the gypsies of the city, and that disappeared for years before their current vindication. They develop in the caves of the Sacromonte neighborhood and have a unique character in the world of flamenco. There are also more classic flamenco shows in the Albaic\u00edn. These flamenco shows, usually linked to restaurants, are one of the city's cultural attractions.\nFestivals. Granada has a very complete range of events: International Music and Dance Festival, International Jazz Festival, Granada Festival South Cinemas and International Tango Festival, among others.\nConcerts.

          "We booked an hour and a half bath with a half hour massage. The first thing we noticed was the friendly greeting and staff showing us the separate change areas, all very well organised. We met up inside the baths and again were given instructions about which pools were hot, warm",
          "If you have never been to a hammam before, you may enjoy this. If you have, keep walking. Totally not worth the money. The inside is beautiful, the baths are nice, and the facilities are clean. The massage and scrub were not relaxing at all, and a waste of time and money.",

        "wiki": "The Alhambra ( (listen), Spanish: [a\u02c8lamb\u027ea]; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u200e, romanized: Al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02be, pronounced [al\u0127am\u02c8ra\u02d0\u0294], lit.\u2009'\"The Red One\"') is a palace and fortress complex located in Granada, Andalusia, Spain. It was originally constructed as a small fortress in AD 889 on the remains of Roman fortifications, and then largely ignored until its ruins were renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar of the Emirate of Granada, who built its current palace and walls with many intricate details. It was converted into a royal palace in 1333 by Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada. After the conclusion of the Christian Reconquista in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where Christopher Columbus received royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered in the Renaissance style. In 1526 Charles I & V commissioned a new Renaissance palace better befitting the Holy Roman Emperor in the revolutionary Mannerist style influenced by humanist philosophy in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid Andalusian architecture, but it was ultimately never completed due to Morisco rebellions in Granada.\nAlhambra's last flowering of Islamic palaces was built for the last Muslim emirs in Spain during the decline of the Nasrid dynasty, who were increasingly subject to the Christian Kings of Castile. After being allowed to fall into disrepair for centuries, the buildings occupied by squatters, Alhambra was rediscovered following the defeat of Napoleon, who had conducted retaliatory destruction of the site. The rediscoverers were first British intellectuals and then other north European Romantic travelers. It is now one of Spain's major tourist attractions, exhibiting the country's most significant and well-known Islamic architecture, together with 16th-century and later Christian building and garden interventions. The Alhambra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Moorish poets described it as \"a pearl set in emeralds\", an allusion to the colour of its buildings and the woods around them. The palace complex was designed with the mountainous site in mind and many forms of technology were considered. The park (Alameda de la Alhambra), which is overgrown with wildflowers and grass in the spring, was planted by the Moors with roses, oranges, and myrtles; its most characteristic feature, however, is the dense wood of English elms brought by the Duke of Wellington in 1812. The park has a multitude of nightingales and is usually filled with the sound of running water from several fountains and cascades. These are supplied through a conduit 8 km (5.0 mi) long, which is connected with the Darro at the monastery of Jesus del Valle above Granada.Despite long neglect, willful vandalism, and some ill-judged restoration, the Alhambra endures as an atypical example of Muslim art in its final European stages, relatively uninfluenced by the direct Byzantine influences found in the Mezquita of C\u00f3rdoba. Most of the palace buildings are quadrangular in plan, with all the rooms opening on to a central court, and the whole reached its present size simply by the gradual addition of new quadrangles, designed on the same principle, though varying in dimensions, and connected with each other by smaller rooms and passages. Alhambra was extended by the different Muslim rulers who lived in the complex. However, each new section that was added followed the consistent theme of \"paradise on earth\". Column arcades, fountains with running water, and reflecting pools were used to add to the aesthetic and functional complexity. In every case, the exterior was left plain and austere. Sun and wind were freely admitted. Blue, red, and a golden yellow, all somewhat faded through lapse of time and exposure, are the colors chiefly employed. The name Alhambra means the red one or the red castle, which refers to the sun-dried bricks that the outer wall is made of.The decoration consists for the upper part of the walls, as a rule, of Arabic inscriptions\u2014mostly poems by Ibn Zamrak and others praising the palace\u2014that are manipulated into geometrical patterns with vegetal background set onto an arabesque setting (\"Ataurique\"). Much of this ornament is carved stucco (plaster) rather than stone. Tile mosaics (\"alicatado\"), with complicated mathematical patterns (\"tracer\u00eda\", most precisely \"lacer\u00eda\"), are largely used as panelling for the lower part. Metal was also not present very mainly. Similar designs are displayed on wooden ceilings (Alfarje). Muqarnas are the main elements for vaulting with stucco, and some of the most accomplished dome examples of this kind are in the Court of the Lions halls. The palace complex is designed in the Nasrid style, the last blooming of Islamic Art in the Iberian Peninsula, that had a great influence on the Maghreb to the present day, and on contemporary Mudejar Art, which is characteristic of western elements reinterpreted into Islamic forms and widely popular during the Reconquista in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAlhambra derives from the Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621 al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  (f.), meaning \"the red one\", the complete form of which was \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064f al-Qal\u02bbat al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  \"the red fortress (qalat)\". The \"Al-\" in \"Alhambra\" means \"the\" in Arabic, but this is ignored in general usage in both English and Spanish, where the name is normally given the definite article.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAround the year 889, forces loyal to Umar ibn Hafsun in revolt against Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi and the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba besieged a small Islamic fortress in Granada held by Saw\u0101r Ben Hamd\u016bn. The first reference to al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  came in lines of poetry attached to an arrow shot over the ramparts, recorded by Ibn Hayyan:\n\nCompleted towards the end of Muslim rule of Spain by Yusuf I (1333\u20131353) and Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada (1353\u20131391), the Alhambra is a reflection of the culture of the last centuries of the Muslim rule of Al Andalus, reduced to the Nasrid Emirate of Granada. It is a place where artists and intellectuals had taken refuge as the Reconquista by Spanish Christians won victories over Al Andalus. The Alhambra integrates natural site qualities with constructed structures and gardens, and is a testament to Moorish culture in Spain and the skills of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian artisans, craftsmen, and builders of their era.\nThe literal translation of Alhambra, \"the red (female),\" reflects the color of the red clay of the surroundings of which the fort is made. The buildings of the Alhambra were originally whitewashed; however, the buildings as seen today are reddish. Another possible origin of the name is the tribal designation of the Nasrid Dynasty, known as the Banu al-Ahmar Arabic: Sons of the Red (male), a sub-tribe of the Arab Qahtanite Banu Khazraj tribe. One of the early Nasrid ancestors was nicknamed Yusuf Al Ahmar (Yusuf the Red) and hence the (Nasrid) fraction of the Banu Khazraj took up the name of Banu al-Ahmar.\n\nThe first reference to the Qal\u2018at al-\u1e24amra was during the battles between the Arabs and the Muladies (people of mixed Arab and European descent) during the rule of the \u2018Abdullah ibn Muhammad (r. 888\u2013912). In one particularly fierce and bloody skirmish, the Muladies soundly defeated the Arabs, who were then forced to take shelter in a primitive red castle located in the province of Elvira, presently located in Granada. According to surviving documents from the era, the red castle was quite small, and its walls were not capable of deterring an army intent on conquering. The castle was then largely ignored until the eleventh century, when its ruins were renovated and rebuilt by Samuel ibn Naghrela, vizier to the emir Badis ben Habus of the Zirid Dynasty of Al Andalus, in an attempt to preserve the small Jewish settlement also located on the natural plateau, Sabikah Hill.\nIbn Nasr, the founder of the Nasrid Dynasty, was forced to flee to Ja\u00e9n to avoid persecution by King Ferdinand III of Castile and the Reconquista supporters working to end Spain's Moorish rule. After retreating to Granada, Ibn-Nasr took up residence at the Palace of Badis ben Habus in the Alhambra. A few months later, he embarked on the construction of a new Alhambra fit for the residence of a sultan. According to an Arabic manuscript since published as the An\u00f3nimo de Granada y Copenhague,\n\nThis year, 1238 Abdallah ibn al-Ahmar climbed to the place called \"the Alhambra\" inspected it, laid out the foundations of a castle and left someone in charge of its construction...\nThe design included plans for six palaces, five of which were grouped in the northeast quadrant forming a royal quarter, two circuit towers, and numerous bathhouses. During the reign of the Nasrid Dynasty, the Alhambra was transformed into a palatine city, complete with an irrigation system composed of acequias for the gardens of the Generalife located outside the fortress. Previously, the old Alhambra structure had been dependent upon rainwater collected from a cistern and from what could be brought up from the Albaic\u00edn. The creation of the Sultan's Canal solidified the identity of the Alhambra as a palace-city rather than a defensive and ascetic structure. The hydraulic system includes two long water channels and several sophisticated elevation devices to bring water onto the plateau.\n\nThe last Nasrid sultan, Muhammad XII of Granada, surrendered the Emirate of Granada in 1492 without the Alhambra itself being attacked when the forces of the Reyes Cat\u00f3licos, King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, took the surrounding territory with a force of overwhelming numbers.\nThe decoration within the palaces comes from the last great period of Andalusian art in Granada. With little of the Byzantine influence of contemporary Abassid architecture, artists endlessly reproduced the same forms and trends, creating a new style that developed over the course of the Nasrid Dynasty. The Nasrids used freely all the stylistic elements that had been created and developed during eight centuries of Muslim rule in the Peninsula, including the Caliphate horseshoe arch, the Almohad sebka (a grid of rhombuses), the Almoravid palm, and unique combinations of them, as well as innovations such as stilted arches and muqarnas (stalactite ceiling decorations). Structurally, the design is simple and does not evince significant innovation. While artistically pleasing it was until the reconquest structurally ad hoc and reliant on the skills of subject artisans and workers.\nColumns and muqarnas appear in several chambers, and the interiors of numerous palaces are decorated with arabesques and calligraphy. The arabesques of the interior are ascribed to, among other sultans, Yusuf I, Mohammed V, and Ismail I, Sultan of Granada.\n\nAfter the Christian conquest of the city in 1492, the conquerors began to alter the Alhambra. The open work was filled up with whitewash, the painting and gilding effaced, and the furniture soiled, torn, or removed. Charles I (1516\u20131556) rebuilt portions in the Renaissance style of the period and destroyed the greater part of the winter palace to make room for a Renaissance-style structure which was never completed. Philip V (1700\u20131746) Italianised the rooms and completed his palace in the middle of what had been the Moorish building; he had partitions constructed which blocked up whole apartments.Over subsequent centuries the Moorish art was further damaged, and in 1812 some of the towers were destroyed by the French under Count Sebastiani. In 1821, an earthquake caused further damage. Restoration work was undertaken in 1828 by the architect Jos\u00e9 Contreras, endowed in 1830 by Ferdinand VII. After the death of Contreras in 1847, it was continued by his son Rafael (died 1890) and his grandson. Especially notable was the intervention of Leopoldo Torres Balb\u00e1s in the 1930s: the young architect \"opened arcades that had been walled up, re-excavated filled-in pools, replaced missing tiles, completed inscriptions that lacked portions of their stuccoed lettering, and installed a ceiling in the still unfinished palace of Charles V\".\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nAccording to the site's current architect, Pedro Salmeron Escobar, the Alhambra evolved organically over a period of several centuries from the ancient hilltop fortress defined by a narrow promontory carved by the river Darro and overlooking the Vega or Plain of Granada as it descends from the Sierra Nevada. The red earth from which the fortress is constructed is a granular aggregate held together by a medium of red clay which gives the resulting layered brick- and stone- reinforced construction (tapial calicastrado) its characteristic hue and is at the root of the name of 'the Red Hill'.This crude earthiness is counterpointed by the startling fine alabaster white stucco work of the famous interiors. Meltwater from the 'Snowy Mountains' is drawn across an arched vault at the eastern tip of the Torre del Agua ('Water Tower') and channeled through the citadel via a complex system of conduits (acequia) and water tanks (los albercones) which create the celebrated interplay of light, sound and surface.Alhambra is about 740 metres (2,430 ft) in length by 205 metres (670 ft) at its greatest width. It extends from west-northwest to east-southeast and covers an area of about 142,000 square metres (1,530,000 sq ft) or 35 acres. The Alhambra's most westerly feature is the Alcazaba (citadel), a strongly fortified position built to protect the original post-Roman districts of Iliberri, now 'Centro', and G\u00e1rnata al-yah\u016bd ('Granada of the Jews', now Realejo, and the Moorish suburb of El Albayz\u00edn.\n\nDue to touristic demand, modern access runs contrary to the original sequence which began from a principal access via the Puerta de la Justicia (Gate of Justice) onto a large souq or public market square facing the Alcazaba, now subdivided and obscured by later Christian-era development. From the Puerta del Vino (Wine Gate) ran the Calle Real (Royal Street) dividing the Alhambra along its axial spine into a southern residential quarter, with mosques, hamams (bathhouses) and diverse functional establishments, and a greater northern portion, occupied by several palaces of the nobility with extensive landscaped gardens commanding views over the Albayzin. All of this was subservient to the great Tower of the Ambassadors in the Palacio Comares, which acted as the royal audience chamber and throne room with its three arched windows dominating the city. The private, internalised universe of the Palacio de Los Leones (Palace of the Lions) adjoins the public spaces at right angles (see Plan illustration) but was originally connected only by the function of the Royal Baths, the Eye of Aixa's Room serving as the exquisitely decorated focus of meditation and authority overlooking the refined garden of Lindaraja/Daraxa toward the city.The rest of the plateau comprises a number of earlier and later Moorish palaces, enclosed by a fortified wall, with thirteen defensive towers, some such as the Torres de la Infanta and Cattiva containing elaborate vertical palaces in miniature. The river Darro passes through a ravine on the north and divides the plateau from the Albaic\u00edn district of Granada. Similarly, the Assabica Valley, containing the Alhambra Park, lies on the west and south, and, beyond this valley, the almost parallel ridge of Monte Mauror separates it from the Antequeruela district. Another ravine separates it from the Generalife, the summer pleasure gardens of the emir. Escobar notes that the later planting of deciduous elms obscures the overall perception of the layout, so a better reading of the original landscape is given in winter when the trees are bare.\n\n\n== Main structures ==\n\nThe Alhambra resembles many medieval Christian strongholds in its threefold arrangement as a castle, a palace and a residential annex for subordinates. The alcazaba or citadel, its oldest part, is built on the isolated and precipitous foreland which terminates the plateau on the northwest. All that remains are its massive outer walls, towers and ramparts. On its watchtower, the 25 m (85 ft) high Torre de la Vela, the flag of Ferdinand and Isabella was first raised as a symbol of the Spanish conquest of Granada on 2 January 1492. A turret containing a large bell was added in the 18th century and restored after being damaged by lightning in 1881. Beyond the Alcazaba is the palace of the Moorish rulers, The Nasrid Palaces or Alhambra proper, and beyond this is the Alhambra Alta (Upper Alhambra), originally occupied by officials and courtiers.\nAccess from the city to the Alhambra Park is afforded by the Puerta de las Granadas (Gate of Pomegranates), a triumphal arch dating from the 15th century. A steep ascent leads past the Pillar of Charles V, a fountain erected in 1554, to the main entrance of the Alhambra. This is the Puerta de la Justicia (Gate of Justice), a massive horseshoe archway surmounted by a square tower and used by the Moors as an informal court of justice. The hand of Fatima, with fingers outstretched as a talisman against the evil eye, is carved above this gate on the exterior; a key, the symbol of authority, occupies the corresponding place on the interior. A narrow passage leads inward to the Plaza de los Aljibes (Place of the Cisterns), a broad open space which divides the Alcazaba from the Moorish palace. To the left of the passage rises the Torre del Vino (Wine Tower), built in 1345 and used in the 16th century as a cellar. On the right is the palace of Charles V, a smaller Renaissance building, to construct which part of the Alhambra, including the original main entrance, was torn down.\n\n\n=== Royal complex ===\n\nThe Royal Complex (Plaza de Nazar\u00edes) consists of three main parts: Mexuar, Serallo, and the Harem. The Mexuar is modest in decor and houses the functional areas for conducting business and administration. Strapwork is used to decorate the surfaces in Mexuar. The ceilings, floors, and trim are made of dark wood and are in sharp contrast to white, plaster walls. Serallo, built during the reign of Yusuf I in the 14th century, contains the Patio de los Arrayanes (Court of the Myrtles). Brightly colored interiors featured dado panels, yeser\u00eda, azulejo, cedar, and artesonado. Artesonado are highly decorative ceilings and other woodwork. Lastly, the Harem is also elaborately decorated and contains the living quarters for the wives and mistresses of the Arab monarchs. This area contains a bathroom with running water (cold and hot), baths, and pressurized water for showering. The bathrooms were open to the elements in order to allow in light and air.\n\n\n=== Court of the Myrtles ===\n\nThe present entrance to the Palacio \u00c1rabe (Arab palace), or Casa Real, is by a small door from which a corridor connects to the Patio de los Arrayanes (Court of the Myrtles), also called the Patio de la Alberca (Court of the Blessing or Court of the Pond), from the Arabic birka, \"pool\". The birka helped to cool the palace and acted as a symbol of power. Because water was usually in short supply, the technology required to keep these pools full was expensive and difficult. This court is 42 m (140 ft) long by 22 m (74 ft) broad, and in the centre there is a large pond set in the marble pavement, full of goldfish, and with myrtles growing along its sides. There are galleries on the north and south sides; the southern gallery is 7 m (23 ft) high and supported by a marble colonnade. Underneath it, to the right, was the principal entrance, and over it are three windows with arches and miniature pillars. From this court, the walls of the Torre de Comares are seen rising over the roof to the north and reflected in the pond.\n\n\n=== Hall of the Ambassadors ===\n\nThe Sal\u00f3n de los Embajadores (Hall of the Ambassadors) is the largest room in the Alhambra and occupies all the Torre de Comares. It is a square room, the sides being 12 m (37 ft) in length, while the centre of the dome is 23 m (75 ft) high. This was the grand reception room, and the throne of the sultan was placed opposite the entrance. The grand hall projects from the walls of the palace, providing views in three directions. In this sense, it was a \"mirador\" from which the palace's inhabitants could gaze outward to the surrounding landscape.  The tiles are nearly 4 ft (1.2 m) high all round, and the colours vary at intervals. Over them is a series of oval medallions with inscriptions, interwoven with flowers and leaves. There are nine windows, three on each facade, and the ceiling is decorated with white, blue and gold inlays in the shape of circles, crowns and stars. The walls are covered with varied stucco works, surrounding many ancient escutcheons.\n\n\n=== Court of the Lions and fountain ===\n\nThe Court of the Lions (Patio de los Leones) is an oblong courtyard, 116 ft (35 m) in length by 66 ft (20 m) in width, surrounded by a low gallery supported on 124 white marble columns. A pavilion projects into the court at each extremity, with filigree walls and a light domed roof. The square is paved with coloured tiles and the colonnade with white marble, while the walls are covered 5 ft (1.5 m) up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles, with a border above and below of enamelled blue and gold. The columns supporting the roof and gallery are irregularly placed. They are adorned by varieties of foliage, etc.; about each arch there is a large square of stucco arabesques; and over the pillars is another stucco square of filigree work.\n\n\n==== Fountain of the Lions ====\nIn the centre of the court is the Fountain of the Lions, an alabaster basin supported by the figures of twelve lions in white marble, not designed with sculptural accuracy but as symbols of strength, power, and sovereignty. Each hour one lion would produce water from its mouth. At the edge of the great fountain there is a poem written by Ibn Zamrak. This praises the beauty of the fountain and the power of the lions, but it also describes their ingenious hydraulic systems and how they actually worked, which baffled all those who saw them.\n\n\n=== Hall of the Abencerrajes ===\n\nThe Sala de los Abencerrajes (Hall of the Abencerrages) derives its name from a legend according to which the father of Boabdil, the last sultan of Granada, having invited the chiefs of that line to a banquet, massacred them here. This room is a perfect square, with a lofty dome and trellised windows at its base. The roof is decorated in blue, brown, red and gold, and the columns supporting it spring out into the arch form in a remarkably beautiful manner. Opposite to this hall is the Sala de las dos Hermanas (Hall of the two Sisters), so-called from two white marble slabs laid as part of the pavement. These slabs measure 500 by 220 cm (15 by 7\u00bd ft). There is a fountain in the middle of this hall, and the roof \u2013 a dome honeycombed with tiny cells, all different, and said to number 5000 \u2013 is an example of the \"stalactite vaulting\" of the Moors.\n\n\n=== Generalife ===\n\nOf the outlying buildings connected to the Alhambra, the foremost in interest is the Palacio de Generalife or Gineralife (the Muslim Jennat al Arif, \"Garden of Arif,\" or \"Garden of the Architect\"). This villa dates from the beginning of the 14th century but has been restored several times. The Villa de los Martires (Martyrs' Villa), on the summit of Monte Mauror, commemorates by its name the Christian slaves who were forced to build the Alhambra and confined here in subterranean cells. The Torres Bermejas (Vermilion Towers), also on Monte Mauror, are a well-preserved Moorish fortification, with underground cisterns, stables, and accommodation for a garrison of 200 men. Several Roman tombs were discovered in 1829 and 1857 at the base of Monte Mauror.\n\n\n=== Other features ===\nAmong the other features of the Alhambra are the Sala de la Justicia (Hall of Justice), the Patio del Mexuar (Court of the Council Chamber), the Patio de Daraxa (Court of the Vestibule), and the Peinador de la Reina (Queen's Robing Room), in which there is similar architecture and decoration. The palace and the Upper Alhambra also contain baths, rows of bedrooms and summer-rooms, a whispering gallery and labyrinth, and vaulted sepulchres.\nThe original furniture of the palace is represented by one of the famous Alhambra vases, very large Hispano-Moresque ware vases made in the Sultanate to stand in niches around the palace. These famous examples of Hispano-Moresque ware date from the 14th and 15th centuries. The one remaining in the palace, from about 1400, is 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) high; the background is white and the decoration is blue, white and gold.\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\n\n=== In literature ===\n\nParts of the following works are set in the Alhambra:\n\nWashington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra. This is a collection of essays, verbal sketches, and stories. Irving lived in the palace while writing the book and was instrumental in introducing the site to Western audiences.\nSalman Rushdie's The Moor's Last Sigh\nAmin Maalouf's Leo Africanus, depicting the reconquest of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs.\nPhilippa Gregory's The Constant Princess, depicting Catalina the Infanta of Spain as she lived in the Alhambra after her parents took Granada.\nFederico Garc\u00eda Lorca's play Do\u00f1a Rosita the Spinster, mentioned by title character Do\u00f1a Rosita in her song/speech to the Manola sisters.\nPaulo Coelho's novel The Alchemist\nAli Smith's The Accidental\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's play Man and Superman\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai's Seiobo There Below\nHanya Yanagihara's A Little Life\n\n\n=== In music ===\nThe plot of the Ballet-h\u00e9ro\u00efque entitled Za\u00efde, Reine De Grenade, by the French Baroque composer Joseph-Nicolas-Pancrace Royer (c. 1705\u20131755), takes place at the Alhambra. Alhambra has directly inspired musical compositions as Francisco T\u00e1rrega's famous tremolo study for guitar Recuerdos De La Alhambra. Claude Debussy's piece for two pianos composed in 1901, Lindaraja, and the prelude, La Puerta Del Vino, from the second book of preludes composed from 1912 to 1913. Isaac Alb\u00e9niz wrote a piano suite Recuerdos De viaje, which included a piece called \"En La Alhambra\", while his suite Iberia contained a piece called \"El Albacin\". Alb\u00e9niz also composed an uncompleted Suite Alhambra.\n\n\"En Los Jardines Del Generalife\", the first movement of Manuel de Falla's Noches En Los Jardines De Espa\u00f1a, and other pieces by composers such as Ruperto Chap\u00ed (Los Gnomos De La Alhambra, 1891), Tom\u00e1s Bret\u00f3n, and many others are included in a stream referred to by scholars as Alhambrismo.In 1976, filmmaker Christopher Nupen filmed The Song of the Guitar at the Alhambra which was an hour-long program featuring the legendary Spanish guitarist, Andr\u00e9s Segovia.\nBritish composer Peter Seabourne wrote an extended piano cycle Steps Volume 3: Arabesques (2008-2012) based on shared experiences of the Alhambra with his painter aunt Ann Seabourne, and a movement from his Steps Volume 1 is entitled \"El Suspiro del Moro\" inspired by the legend of the expulsion of the last Moorish King of Granada. Julian Anderson wrote an orchestral piece, Alhambra Fantasy.\nIn pop and folk music, Alhambra is the subject of the Ghymes song of the same name. The rock band Grateful Dead released a song called \"Terrapin Station\" on the 1977 album of the same name. It consisted of a series of small compositions penned by Robert Hunter and put to music by Jerry Garcia; a lyrical section of this suite was called \"Alhambra\". In September 2006, Canadian singer/composer Loreena McKennitt performed live at the Alhambra. The resulting video recordings premiered on PBS and were later released as a 3-disc DVD/CD set called Nights from the Alhambra. The Basque pop group Mocedades performed a song called \"Juntos En La Alhambra\". Alhambra is the title of an EP recording by Canadian rock band, The Tea Party, containing acoustic versions of a few of their songs. Alhambra and Albaic\u00edn are mentioned in the M\u00e4go de Oz song named \"El Paseo De Los Tristes\" from the album entitled Gaia II. On California rapper Dom Kennedy's 2015 album By Dom Kennedy, there is a song entitled \"Alhambra\".\n\n\n=== In mathematics ===\n\nThe Alhambra tiles are remarkable in that they contain nearly all, if not all, of the seventeen mathematically possible wallpaper groups. This is a unique accomplishment in world architecture. M. C. Escher's visit in 1922 and study of the Moorish use of symmetries in the Alhambra tiles inspired his subsequent work on tessellation, which he called \"regular divisions of the plane\".\n\n\n=== In film ===\nMarcel L'Herbier's 1921 film El Dorado features many scenes shot in and around the Alhambra palace. This was the first time permission had been granted for a feature film company to shoot inside the Alhambra palace and L'Herbier gave prominent place to its gardens, fountains and geometric architectural patterns, which became some of the film's most memorable images.\nAnimated films by Spanish director Juan Bautista Berasategui such as Ahmed, El Principe De La Alhambra and El Embrujo Del Sur are based on stories in Washington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra.\nColumbus interview with Queen Isabella in Conquest of Paradise representing Granada after the Reconquest were filmed at Alhambra. As well as the Palace Scenes of Kingdom of Heaven representing Jerusalem during the Cruzades. Both films were made by Ridley Scott.\nThe Court of the Lions was depicted in Assassin's Creed (2016) when Sultan Muhammad XII surrenders the 'Apple of Eden', a powerful artifact in the center of the movie plot, in exchange for his son's safe return. Both the Court of the Lions and Granada's Albaicin are featured on The animated film Tad Jones: The Hero Returns.The fictional Broadway theatre (the interior actually Auckland, New Zealand's Civic Theatre), in which Kong is displayed as the 'Eighth Wonder of the World' in 2005's King Kong, is named \"The Alhambra\".2018 South Korean television series Memories of the Alhambra is based in Granada, Spain. The CEO of an investment company that specializes in optical devices, travels to Granada, Spain to meet the creator of the game. He gets entangled in a mysterious incident, and the border between the real world and the AR world begins to blur.\n\n\n=== In board games ===\nDirk Henn's game Der Palast von Alhambra, literally \"The Palace of the Alhambra\". Players compete to get funds and pay contractors to build the best palace complex. It was published by Queen Games with numerous expansion packs. It won the Spiel des Jahres award in 2003.\n\n\n=== In astronomy ===\nThere is a main belt asteroid named Alhambra.\n\n\n=== In architecture ===\nThe Alhambra inspired:\n\nthe synagogue Isaac M.

        "wiki": "Luis Bu\u00f1uel Portol\u00e9s (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8lwis \u03b2u\u02c8\u0272wel po\u027eto\u02c8les]; 22 February 1900 \u2013 29 July 1983) was a Spanish-Mexican filmmaker, who worked in France, Mexico and Spain.When Bu\u00f1uel died at age 83, his obituary in The New York Times called him \"an iconoclast, moralist, and revolutionary who was a leader of avant-garde surrealism in his youth and a dominant international movie director half a century later\".  His first picture, Un Chien Andalou\u2014made in the silent era\u2014is still viewed regularly throughout the world and retains its power to shock the viewer, and his last film, That Obscure Object of Desire\u2014made 48 years later\u2014won him Best Director awards from the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics.  Writer Octavio Paz called Bu\u00f1uel's work \"the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality...scandalous and subversive\".Often associated with the surrealist movement of the 1920s, Bu\u00f1uel created films from the 1920s through the 1970s. Having worked in Europe and North America, and in French and Spanish, Bu\u00f1uel's films also spanned various genres. Despite this variety, filmmaker John Huston believed that, regardless of genre, a Bu\u00f1uel film is so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable, or, as Ingmar Bergman put it, \"Bu\u00f1uel nearly always made Bu\u00f1uel films\".Seven of Bu\u00f1uel's films are included in Sight & Sound's 2012 critics' poll of the top 250 films of all time. Fifteen of his films are included in the They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? list of the 1,000 greatest films of all time, second only to Jean-Luc Godard, with sixteen, and he ranks number 13 on their list of the top 250 directors.\n\n\n== Early years ==\n\nBu\u00f1uel was born in Calanda, a small town in the province of Teruel, in the Aragon region of Spain, to Leonardo Bu\u00f1uel, the cultivated scion of an established Aragonese family, and Mar\u00eda Portol\u00e9s, many years younger than her husband, with wealth and family connections of her own. He would later describe his birthplace by saying that in Calanda, \"the Middle Ages lasted until World War I\". The oldest of seven children, Luis had two brothers, Alfonso and Leonardo, and four sisters: Alicia, Concepci\u00f3n, Margarita and Mar\u00eda.When Bu\u00f1uel was four and a half months old, the family moved to Zaragoza, where they were one of the wealthiest families in town. In Zaragoza, Bu\u00f1uel received a strict Jesuit education at the private Colegio del Salvador. After being kicked and insulted by the study hall proctor before a final exam, Bu\u00f1uel refused to return to the school.  He told his mother he had been expelled, which was not true; in fact, he had received the highest marks on his world history exam. Bu\u00f1uel finished the last two years of his high school education at the local public school.  Even as a child, Bu\u00f1uel was something of a cinematic showman; friends from that period described productions in which Bu\u00f1uel would project shadows on a screen using a magic lantern and a bedsheet. He also excelled at boxing and playing the violin.In his youth, Bu\u00f1uel was deeply religious, serving at Mass and taking Communion every day, until, at the age of 16, he grew disgusted with what he perceived as the illogicality of the Church, along with its power and wealth.\n\nIn 1917, he attended the University of Madrid, first studying agronomy then industrial engineering and finally switching to philosophy.  He developed very close relationships with painter Salvador Dal\u00ed and poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, among other important Spanish creative artists living in the Residencia de Estudiantes, with the three friends forming the nucleus of the Spanish Surrealist avant-garde,  and becoming known as members of \"La Generaci\u00f3n del 27\". Bu\u00f1uel was especially taken with Lorca, later writing in his autobiography: \"We liked each other instantly.  Although we seemed to have little in common\u2014I was a redneck from Aragon, and he an elegant Andalusian\u2014we spent most of our time together... We used to sit on the grass in the evenings behind the Residencia (at that time, there were vast open spaces reaching to the horizon), and he would read me his poems. He read slowly and beautifully, and through him I began to discover a wholly new world.\" Bu\u00f1uel's relationship with Dal\u00ed was somewhat more troubled, being tinged with jealousy over the growing intimacy between Dal\u00ed and Lorca and resentment over Dal\u00ed's early success as an artist.Starting at age 17, he steadily dated the future poet and dramatist Concha M\u00e9ndez, with whom he vacationed every summer at San Sebasti\u00e1n. He introduced her to his friends at the Residencia as his fianc\u00e9e.   After five years, she broke off the relationship, citing Bu\u00f1uel's \"insufferable character\".During his student years, Bu\u00f1uel became an accomplished hypnotist. He claimed that once, while calming a hysterical prostitute through hypnotic suggestion, he inadvertently put one of the several bystanders into a trance as well. He was often to insist that watching movies was a form of hypnosis:  \"This kind of cinematographic hypnosis is no doubt due to the darkness of the theatre and to the rapidly changing scenes, lights, and camera movements, which weaken the spectator's critical intelligence and exercise over him a kind of fascination.\"Bu\u00f1uel's interest in films was intensified by a viewing of Fritz Lang's Der m\u00fcde Tod: \"I came out of the Vieux Colombier [theater] completely transformed. Images could and did become for me the true means of expression. I decided to devote myself to the cinema\".  At age 72, Bu\u00f1uel had not lost his enthusiasm for this film, asking the octogenarian Lang for his autograph.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early French period  (1925\u20131930) ===\n\nIn 1925 Bu\u00f1uel moved to Paris, where he began work as a secretary in an organization called the International Society of Intellectual Cooperation. He also became actively involved in cinema and theater, going to the movies as often as three times a day. Through these interests, he met a number of influential people, including the pianist Ricardo Vi\u00f1es, who was instrumental in securing Bu\u00f1uel's selection as artistic director of the Dutch premiere of Manuel de Falla's puppet-opera El retablo de maese Pedro in 1926.He decided to enter the film industry and enrolled in a private film school run by Jean Epstein and some associates.  At that time, Epstein was one of the most celebrated commercial directors working in France, his films being hailed as \"the triumph of impressionism in motion, but also the triumph of the modern spirit\".   Before long, Bu\u00f1uel was working for Epstein as an assistant director on Mauprat (1926) and La chute de la maison Usher (1928), and also for Mario Nalpas on La Sir\u00e8ne des Tropiques (1927), starring Josephine Baker.  He appeared on screen in a small part as a smuggler in Jacques Feyder's Carmen (1926).When Bu\u00f1uel somewhat derisively refused to acquiesce to Epstein's demand that he assist Epstein's mentor, Abel Gance, who was at the time working on the film Napol\u00e9on, Epstein dismissed him angrily, saying \"How can a little asshole like you dare to talk that way about a great director like Gance?\" then added \"You seem rather surrealist. Beware of surrealists, they are crazy people.\"After parting with Epstein, Bu\u00f1uel worked as film critic for La Gaceta Literaria (1927) and Les Cahiers d'Art (1928). In the periodicals L'Amic de les Arts and La gaseta de les Arts, he and Dal\u00ed carried on a series of \"call and response\" essays on cinema and theater, debating such technical issues as segmentation, d\u00e9coupage, \"photogenia\" (founded on the insert shot) and rhythmic editing.  He also collaborated with the celebrated writer Ram\u00f3n G\u00f3mez de la Serna on the script for what he hoped would be his first film, \"a story in six scenes\" called Los caprichos.  Through his involvement with Gaceta Literaria, he helped establish Madrid's first cine-club and served as its inaugural chairman.It was during this time that he met his future wife, Jeanne Rucar Lefebvre, a gymnastics teacher who had won a bronze medal at the 1924 Paris Olympics. Bu\u00f1uel courted her in a formal Aragonese manner, complete with a chaperone,  and they married in 1934 despite a warning by Jean Epstein when Bu\u00f1uel first proposed in 1930:  \"Jeanne, you are making a mistake... It's not right for you, don't marry him.\" The two remained married throughout his life and had two sons, Juan Luis and Rafael. Diego Bu\u00f1uel, filmmaker and host of the National Geographic Channel's Don't Tell My Mother series, is their grandson.\n\n\n==== Un Chien Andalou (1929) ====\n\nAfter this apprenticeship, Bu\u00f1uel shot \nand directed a 16-minute short, Un Chien Andalou, with Salvador Dal\u00ed. The film, financed by Bu\u00f1uel's mother, consists of a series of startling images of a Freudian nature,  starting with a woman's eyeball being sliced open with a razor blade. Un Chien Andalou was enthusiastically received by the burgeoning French surrealist movement of the time and continues to be shown regularly in film societies to this day. It has been called \"the most famous short film ever made\" by critic Roger Ebert.The script was written in six days at Dal\u00ed's home in Cadaqu\u00e9s. In a letter to a friend written in February 1929, Bu\u00f1uel described the writing process: \"We had to look for the plot line. Dal\u00ed said to me, 'I dreamed last night of ants swarming around in my hands', and I said, 'Good Lord, and I dreamed that I had sliced somebody or other's eye. There's the film, let's go and make it.'\"  In deliberate contrast to the approach taken by Jean Epstein and his peers, which was to never leave anything in their work to chance, with every aesthetic decision having a rational explanation and fitting clearly into the whole, Bu\u00f1uel and Dal\u00ed made a cardinal point of eliminating all logical\nassociations.   In Bu\u00f1uel's words: \"Our only rule was very simple: no idea or image that might lend itself to a rational explanation of any kind would be accepted. We had to open all doors to the irrational and keep only those images that surprised us, without trying to explain why\".It was Bu\u00f1uel's intention to outrage the self-proclaimed artistic vanguard of his youth, later saying:  \"Historically the film represents a violent reaction against what in those days was called 'avant-garde,' which was aimed exclusively at artistic sensibility and the audience's reason.\"  Against his hopes and expectations, the film was a popular success with the very audience he had wanted to insult, leading Bu\u00f1uel to exclaim in exasperation, \"What can I do about the people who adore all that is new, even when it goes against their deepest convictions, or about the insincere, corrupt press, and the inane herd that saw beauty or poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate impassioned call for murder?\"Although Un Chien Andalou is a silent film, during the original screening (attended by the elite of the Parisian art world),  Bu\u00f1uel played a sequence of phonograph records which he switched manually while keeping his pockets full of stones with which to pelt anticipated hecklers. After the premiere, Bu\u00f1uel and Dal\u00ed were granted formal admittance to the tight-knit community of Surrealists, led by poet Andr\u00e9 Breton.\n\n\n==== L'Age d'Or (1930) ====\n\nLate in 1929, on the strength of Un Chien Andalou, Bu\u00f1uel and Dal\u00ed were commissioned to make another short film by Marie-Laurie and Charles de Noailles, owners of a private cinema on the Place des \u00c9tats-Unis and financial supporters of productions by Jacques Manuel, Man Ray and Pierre Chenal.  At first, the intent was that the new film be around the same length as Un Chien, only this time with sound. But by mid-1930, the film had grown segmentally to an hour's duration. Anxious that it was over twice as long as planned and at double the budget, Bu\u00f1uel offered to trim the film and cease production, but Noailles gave him the go-ahead to continue the project.The film, entitled L'Age d'Or, was begun as a second collaboration with Dal\u00ed, but, while working on the scenario, the two had a falling out;  Bu\u00f1uel, who at the time had strong leftist sympathies, desired a deliberate undermining of all bourgeois institutions, while Dal\u00ed, who eventually supported the Spanish fascist Francisco Franco and various figures of the European aristocracy, wanted merely to cause a scandal through the use of various scatological and anti-Catholic images. The friction between them was exacerbated when, at a dinner party in Cadaqu\u00e9s, Bu\u00f1uel tried to throttle Dal\u00ed's girlfriend, Gala, the wife of Surrealist poet Paul \u00c9luard.  In consequence, Dal\u00ed had nothing to do with the actual shooting of the film.   During the course of production, Bu\u00f1uel worked around his technical ignorance by filming mostly in sequence and using nearly every foot of film that he shot. Bu\u00f1uel invited friends and acquaintances to appear, gratis, in the film; for example, anyone who owned a tuxedo or a party frock got a part in the salon scene.\n L'Age d'Or was publicly proclaimed by Dal\u00ed as a deliberate attack on Catholicism, and this precipitated a much larger scandal than Un Chien Andalou.  One early screening was taken over by members of the fascist League of Patriots and the Anti-Jewish Youth Group, who hurled purple ink at the screen and then vandalised the adjacent art gallery, destroying a number of valuable surrealist paintings.  The film was banned by the Parisian police \"in the name of public order\".  The de Noailles, both Catholics, were threatened with excommunication by The Vatican because of the film's blasphemous final scene (which visually links Jesus Christ with the writings of the Marquis de Sade), so they made the decision in 1934 to withdraw all prints from circulation, and L'Age d'Or was not seen again until 1979, after their deaths, although a print was smuggled to England for private viewing.  The furor was so great that the premiere of another film financed by the de Noailles, Jean Cocteau's The Blood of a Poet, had to be delayed for over two years until outrage over L'Age d'Or had died down. To make matters worse, Charles de Noailles was forced to withdraw his membership from the Jockey Club.Concurrent with the succ\u00e8s de scandale, both Bu\u00f1uel and the film's leading lady, Lya Lys, received offers of interest from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and traveled to Hollywood at the studio's expense. While in the United States, Bu\u00f1uel associated with other celebrity expatriates including Sergei Eisenstein, Josef Von Sternberg, Jacques Feyder, Charles Chaplin and Bertolt Brecht.  All that was required of Bu\u00f1uel by his loose-ended contract with MGM was that he \"learn some good American technical skills\", but, after being ushered off the first set he visited because the star, Greta Garbo, did not welcome intruders, he decided to stay at home most of the time and only show up to collect his paycheck.  His only enduring contribution to MGM came when he served as an extra in La Fruta Amarga, a Spanish-language remake of Min and Bill.   When, after a few months at the studio, he was asked to watch rushes of Lili Damita to gauge her Spanish accent, he refused and sent a message to studio boss Irving Thalberg stating that he was there as a Frenchman, not a Spaniard, and he \"didn't have time to waste listening to one of the whores\".  He was back in Spain shortly thereafter.\n\n\n=== Spain (1931\u20131937) ===\nSpain in the early 1930s was a time of political and social turbulence, a period of intense and bloody upheaval. Due to both a surge in anti-clerical sentiment and a longrunning desire for retribution for the corruption and malfesance of the extreme right and their supporters in the church, Anarchists and Radical Socialists sacked monarchist headquarters in Madrid and proceeded to set afire or otherwise wreck more than a dozen churches in the capital. Similar revolutionary acts occurred in a score of other cities in southern and eastern Spain, in most cases with the acquiescence and occasionally with the assistance of the official Republican authorities.Bu\u00f1uel's future wife, Jeanne Rucar, recalled that during that period, \"he got very excited about politics and the ideas that were everywhere in pre-Civil War Spain\". In the first flush of his enthusiasm, Bu\u00f1uel joined the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) in 1931 though later in life he denied becoming a Communist.\n \nIn 1932, Bu\u00f1uel was invited to serve as film documentarian for the celebrated Mission Dakar-Djibouti, the first large-scale French anthropological field expedition, which, led by Marcel Griaule, unearthed some 3,500 African artifacts for the new Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme. Although he declined, the project piqued his interest in ethnography. After reading the academic study, Las Jurdes: \u00e9tude de g\u00e9ographie humaine (1927) by Maurice Legendre, he decided to make a film focused on peasant life in Extremadura, one of Spain's poorest states.  The film, called Las Hurdes: Tierra Sin Pan (1933), was financed on a budget of 20,000 pesetas donated by a working-class anarchist friend named Ram\u00f3n Ac\u00edn, who had won the money in a lottery. In the film, Bu\u00f1uel matches scenes of deplorable social conditions with narration that resembles travelogue commentary delivered by a detached-sounding announcer, while the soundtrack thunders inappropriate music by Brahms.\n\nLas Hurdes was banned by the Second Spanish Republic and then by the Francoist dictatorship. It is a film which continues to perplex viewers and resists easy categorization by film historians.  Las Hurdes has been called one of the first examples of mockumentary,  and has been labeled a \"surrealist documentary\", a term defined by critic Merc\u00e8 Ibarz as \"A multi-layered and unnerving use of sound, the juxtaposition of narrative forms already learnt from the written press, travelogues and new pedagogic methods, as well as a subversive use of photographed and filmed documents understood as a basis for contemporary propaganda for the masses\". Catherine Russell has stated that in Las Hurdes, Bu\u00f1uel was able to reconcile his political philosophy with his surrealist aesthetic, with surrealism becoming \"a means of awakening a marxist materialism in danger of becoming a stale orthodoxy\".After Las Hurdes in 1933, Bu\u00f1uel worked in Paris in the dubbing department of Paramount Pictures, but following his marriage in 1934, he switched to Warner Brothers because they operated dubbing studios in Madrid. A friend, Ricardo Urgoiti, who owned the commercial film company Film\u00f3fono, invited Bu\u00f1uel to produce films for a mass audience. He accepted the offer, viewing it as an \"experiment\" as he knew the film industry in Spain was still far behind the technical level of Hollywood or Paris. According to film historian Manuel Rotellar's interviews with members of the cast and crew of the Film\u00f3fono studios, Bu\u00f1uel's only condition was that his involvement with these pictures be completely anonymous, apparently for fear of damaging his reputation as a surrealist. Rotellar insists, however, \"the truth is that it was Luis Bu\u00f1uel who directed the Film\u00f3fono productions\". Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1enz de Heredia, the titular director of two of the films created during Bu\u00f1uel's years as \"executive producer\" at Film\u00f3fono, recounted that it was Bu\u00f1uel who \"explained to me every morning what he wanted...We looked at the takes together and it was Bu\u00f1uel who chose the shots, and in editing, I wasn't even allowed to be present.\" Of the 18 films produced by Bu\u00f1uel during his years at Film\u00f3fono, the four that are believed by critical consensus to have been directed by him are:\n\nDon Quint\u00edn el amargao (Don Quintin the Sourpuss), 1935 \u2013 a musical based on a play by Carlos Arniches, the first zarzuela (a type of Spanish opera) filmed in sound.\nLa hija de Juan Sim\u00f3n (Juan Sim\u00f3n's Daughter), 1935 \u2013 another musical and a major commercial success\n\u00bfQui\u00e9n me quiere a m\u00ed? (Who Loves Me?), 1936 \u2013 a sentimental comedy that Bu\u00f1uel called \"my only commercial failure, and a pretty dismal one at that\".\n\u00a1Centinela, alerta!, (Sentry, Keep Watch!), 1937 \u2013 a comedy and Film\u00f3fono's biggest box-office hit.\nDuring the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939), Bu\u00f1uel placed himself at the disposal of the Republican government. The minister for foreign affairs sent him first to Geneva (September, 1936) and then to Paris  for two years (1936-38), with official responsibility for cataloging Republican propaganda films. Besides the cataloguing, Bu\u00f1uel took left-wing tracts to Spain, did some occasional spying, acted as a bodyguard, and supervised the making of a documentary, entitled Espa\u00f1a 1936  in France and Espana leal, \u00a1en armas! in Spain, that covered the elections, the parades, the riots, and the war. In August 1936, Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca was shot and killed by Nationalist militia. According to his son, Juan Luis, Bu\u00f1uel rarely talked about Lorca but mourned the poet's untimely death throughout his life.Bu\u00f1uel essentially functioned as the coordinator of film propaganda for the Republic, which meant that he was in a position to examine all film shot in the country and decide what sequences could be developed and distributed abroad. The Spanish Ambassador suggested that Bu\u00f1uel revisit Hollywood where he could give technical advice on films being made there about the Spanish Civil War, so in 1938, he and his family traveled to the United States using funds obtained from his old patrons, the Noailles. Almost immediately upon his arrival in America, however, the war ended and the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association of America discontinued making films on the Spanish conflict. According to Bu\u00f1uel's wife, returning to Spain was impossible since the Fascists had seized power, so Bu\u00f1uel decided to stay in the U.S. indefinitely, stating that he was \"immensely attracted by the American naturalness and sociability\".\n\n\n=== United States (1938\u20131945) ===\n\nReturning to Hollywood in 1938, he was befriended by Frank Davis, an MGM producer and member of the Communist Party USA, who placed Bu\u00f1uel on the payroll of Cargo of Innocence, a film about Spanish refugee mothers and children fleeing from Bilbao to the USSR.  The project was shelved precipitately when another Hollywood film about the Spanish Civil War, Blockade, was met with disfavor by the Catholic League of Decency.  In the words of biographer Ruth Brandon, Bu\u00f1uel and his family \"lived from one unsatisfactory crumb of work to another\" because he \"had none of the arrogance and pushiness essential for survival in Hollywood\".  He just wasn't flamboyant enough to capture the attention of Hollywood decision makers, in the opinion of film composer George Antheil: \"Inasmuch as [Bu\u00f1uel], his wife and his little boy seemed to be such absolutely normal, solid persons, as totally un-Surrealist in the Dal\u00ed tradition as one could possibly imagine.\" For the most part, he was snubbed by many of the people in the film community whom he met during his first trip to America, although he was able to sell some gags to Chaplin for his film The Great Dictator.In desperation, to market himself to independent producers, he composed a 21-page autobiography, a section of which, headed \"My Present Plans\", outlined proposals for two documentary films:\n\n\"The Primitive Man\", which would depict \"the terrible struggle of primitive man against a hostile universe, how the world appeared, how they saw it, what ideas they had on love, on death, on fraternity, how and why religion is born\", [italics in original]\n\"Psycho-Pathology\", which would \"expose the origin and development of different psychopathic diseases... Such a documental film, apart from its great scientific interest, could depict on screen a New Form of Terror or its synonym Humour.\" [italics in original]Nobody showed any interest and Bu\u00f1uel realized that staying in Los Angeles was futile, so he traveled to New York to see if he could change his fortunes.\n\nIn New York, Antheil introduced Bu\u00f1uel to Iris Barry, chief curator of film at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).  Barry talked Bu\u00f1uel into joining a committee formed to help educate those within the U.S. government who might not have appreciated fully the effectiveness of film as a medium of propaganda. Bu\u00f1uel was hired to produce a shortened version of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935) as a demonstration project. The finished product was a compilation of scenes from Riefenstahl's Nazi epic with Hans Bertram's Feuertaufe. Bu\u00f1uel stayed at MoMA to work for the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA) as part of a production team that would gather, review and edit films intended as anti-fascist propaganda to be distributed in Latin America by American embassies.  While being vetted for the job at the OCIAA, upon being asked if he was a Communist, he replied: \"I am a Republican,\" and, apparently, the interviewer did not realize that Bu\u00f1uel was referring to the Spanish socialist coalition government, not the American political party.  Describing Bu\u00f1uel's work at MoMA, his friend, composer Gustavo Pittaluga, stated: \"Luis created maybe 2,000 remarkable works.  We were sent anodyne documentaries, often extremely feeble primary materials, which the Museum team turned into marvellous films.  And not just Spanish versions, but also Portuguese, French and English... He would create a good documentary through editing.\" [italics in original]In 1942, Bu\u00f1uel applied for American citizenship, because he anticipated that MoMA would soon be put under federal control.  But that same year, Dal\u00ed published his autobiography, The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, in which he made it clear that he had split with Bu\u00f1uel because the latter was a Communist and an atheist. News of this reached Archbishop Spellman, who angrily confronted Barry with the question: \"Are you aware that you are harbouring in this Museum the Antichrist, the man who made a blasphemous film L'Age d'Or?\"  At the same time, a campaign on the part of Hollywood, through its industry trade paper, the Motion Picture Herald, to undermine the MoMA film unit resulted in a 66% reduction in the department's budget and Bu\u00f1uel felt himself compelled to resign.  In 1944, he returned to Hollywood for the third time, this time as Spanish Dubbing Producer for Warner Brothers. Before leaving New York, he confronted Dal\u00ed at his hotel, the Sherry Netherland, to tell the painter about the damage his book had done and then shoot him in the knee. Bu\u00f1uel did not carry out the violent part of his plan. Dal\u00ed explained himself by saying: \"I did not write my book to put YOU on a pedestal. I wrote it to put ME on a pedestal\".\n\nBu\u00f1uel's first dubbing assignment on returning to Hollywood was My Reputation, a Barbara Stanwyck picture which became El Que Diran in Bu\u00f1uel's hands.  In addition to his dubbing work, Bu\u00f1uel attempted to develop a number of independent projects:\n\nIn collaboration with an old friend from his Surrealist days, Man Ray, he worked on a scenario called The Sewers of Los Angeles, which took place on a mountain of excrement close to a highway and a dust basin.\nWith his friend, Jos\u00e9 Rubia Barcia, he co-wrote a screenplay called La novia de medianoche (The Midnight Bride), a gothic thriller, which lay dormant until it was filmed by Antonio Sim\u00f3n in 1997.\nHe continued working on a screenplay called \"Goya and the Duchess of Alba\", a treatment he had started as early as 1927, with the actor/producer Flori\u00e1n Rey and cameraman Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Beltr\u00e1n, and then resuscitated in 1937 as a project for Paramount.\nIn his 1982 autobiography Mon Dernier soupir (My Last Sigh, 1983, My Last Breath, 1994), Bu\u00f1uel wrote that at the request of director Robert Florey, he submitted a treatment of a scene about a disembodied hand, which was later included in the movie The Beast with Five Fingers (1946), starring Peter Lorre, without acknowledgement of Bu\u00f1uel's contribution or payment of any compensation.  However, Brian Taves, film scholar and archivist with the Library of Congress, has challenged the truth of this claim.In 1945, Bu\u00f1uel's contract with Warner Brothers expired, and he decided not to renew it in order, as he put it: \"to realize my life's ambition for a year: to do nothing\".  While his family enjoyed themselves at the beach, Bu\u00f1uel spent much of his time in Antelope Valley with new acquaintances writer Aldous Huxley and sculptor Alexander Calder, from whom he rented a house.In his autobiography, in a chapter about his second spell in America, Bu\u00f1uel states that \"[o]n several occasions, both American and European producers have suggested that I tackle a film version of Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano\",  but that after reading the book many times as well as eight different screenplays he was unable to come up with a solution for the cinema. The movie was eventually made in 1984 by John Huston.\n\n\n=== Intermediate years (1946\u20131961) ===\n\n\n==== Mexico (1946\u20131953) ====\nThe following year, an old friend, producer Denise Tual, the widow of Pierre Batcheff,  the leading man in Un Chien Andalou, proposed that she and Bu\u00f1uel adapt Lorca's play La casa de Bernarda Alba for production in Paris.  As it turned out, though, before they could both make their way to Europe, they encountered problems in securing the rights from Lorca's family.  While in Mexico City, on a stopover, they had asked \u00d3scar Dancigers, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 producer active in Mexico, for financing.  Dancigers ran an independent production company that specialized in assisting U.S. film studios with on-location shooting in Mexico, but following World War II, he had lost his connection with Hollywood due to his being blacklisted as a Communist.  Although Dancigers wasn't enthusiastic about the Lorca project, he did want to work with Bu\u00f1uel and persuaded the Spanish director to undertake a totally different project.\n\nThe  Golden Age of Mexican cinema was peaking in the mid-to-late 1940s, at just the time Bu\u00f1uel was connecting with Dancigers.  Movies represented Mexico's third largest industry by 1947, employing 32,000 workers, with 72 film producers who invested 66 million pesos (approximately U.S. $13 million) per year, four active studios with 40 million pesos of invested capital, and approximately 1,500 theaters throughout the nation, with about 200 in Mexico City alone.  For their first project, the two men selected what seemed like a sure-fire success, Gran Casino, a musical period piece set in Tampico during the boom years of oil exploitation, starring two of the most popular entertainers in Latin America: Libertad Lamarque, an Argentine actress and singer, and Jorge Negrete, a Mexican singer and leading man in \"charro\" films. Bu\u00f1uel recalled:  \"I kept them singing all the time\u2014a competition, a championship\".The film was not successful at the box office, with some even calling it a fiasco. Different reasons have been given for its failure with the public; for some, Bu\u00f1uel was forced to make concessions to the bad taste of his stars, particularly Negrete, others cite Bu\u00f1uel's rusty technical skills  and lack of confidence after so many years out of the director's chair, while still others speculate that Mexican audiences were tiring of genre movies, called \"churros\", that were perceived as being cheaply and hastily made.The failure of Gran Casino sidelined Bu\u00f1uel, and it was over two years before he had the chance to direct another picture.  According to Bu\u00f1uel, he spent this time \"scratching my nose, watching flies and living off my mother's money\", but he was actually somewhat more industrious than that may sound.  With the husband/wife team of Janet and Luis Alcoriza, he wrote the scenario for Si usted no puede, yo s\u00ed, which was filmed in 1950 by Juli\u00e1n Soler. He also continued developing the idea for a surrealistic film called Ilegible, hijo de flauta, with the poet Juan Larrea. Dancigers pointed out to him that there was currently a vogue for films about street urchins, so Bu\u00f1uel scoured the back streets and slums of Mexico City in search of material, interviewing social workers about street gang warfare and murdered children.During this period, Dancigers was busy producing films for the actor/director Fernando Soler, one of the most durable of Mexican film personalities, having been referred to as the \"national paterfamilias\".   Although Soler typically preferred to direct his own films, for their latest collaboration, El Gran Calavera, based on a play by Adolfo Torrado, he decided that doing both jobs would be too much trouble, so he asked Dancigers to find someone who could be trusted to handle the technical aspects of the directorial duties.  Bu\u00f1uel welcomed the opportunity, stating that: \"I amused myself with the montage, the constructions, the angles... All of that interested me because I was still an apprentice in so-called 'normal' cinema.\"  As a result of his work on this film, he developed a technique for making films cheaply and quickly by limiting them to 125 shots. El Gran Calavera was completed in 16 days at a cost of 400,000 pesos (approximately $46,000 US at 1948 exchange rates).  The picture has been described as \"a hilarious screwball send-up of the Mexican nouveau riche... a wild roller coaster of mistaken identity, sham marriages and misfired suicides\", and it was a big hit at the box office in Mexico.  In 2013, the picture was re-made by Mexican director Gary Alazraki under the title The Noble Family.  In 1949, Bu\u00f1uel renounced his Spanish citizenship to become a naturalized Mexican.The commercial success of El Gran Calavera enabled Bu\u00f1uel to redeem a promise he had extracted from Dancigers, which was that if Bu\u00f1uel could deliver a money-maker, Dancigers would guarantee \"a degree of freedom\" on the next film project.  Knowing that Dancigers was uncomfortable with experimentalism, especially when it might affect the bottom line, Bu\u00f1uel proposed a commercial project titled \u00a1Mi huerfanito jefe!, about a juvenile street vendor who can't sell his final lottery ticket, which ends up being the winner and making him rich.  Dancigers was open to the idea, but instead of a \"feuilleton\", he suggested making \"something rather more serious\".  During his recent researches through the slums of Mexico City, Bu\u00f1uel had read a newspaper account of a twelve-year-old boy's body being found on a garbage dump, and this became the inspiration, and final scene, for the film, called Los olvidados.\n\nThe film tells the story of a street gang of children who terrorize their impoverished neighborhood, at one point brutalizing a blind man and at another assaulting a legless man who moves around on a dolly, which they toss down a hill.  Film historian Carl J. Mora has said of Los olvidados that the director: \"visualized poverty in a radically different way from the traditional forms of Mexican melodrama.  Bu\u00f1uel's street children are not 'ennobled' by their desperate struggle for survival; they are in fact ruthless predators who are not better than their equally unromanticized victims\".  The film was made quickly (18 days) and cheaply (450,000 pesos), with Bu\u00f1uel's fee being the equivalent of $2,000.  During filming, a number of members of the crew resisted the production in a variety of ways:  one technician confronted Bu\u00f1uel and asked why he didn't make a \"real\" Mexican movie \"rather than a miserable picture like this one\", the film's hairdresser quit on the spot over a scene in which the protagonist's mother refuses to give him food (\"In Mexico, no mother would say that to her son.\"), another staff member urged Bu\u00f1uel to abandon shooting on a \"garbage heap\", noting that there were many \"lovely residential neighborhoods like Las Lomas\" that were available, while Pedro de Urdimalas, one of the scriptwriters, refused to allow his name in the credits.\n\nThis hostility was also felt by those who attended the movie's premi\u00e8re in Mexico City on 9 November 1950, when Los olvidados was taken by many as an insult to Mexican sensibilities and to the Mexican nation.  At one point, the audience shrieked in shock as one of the characters looked straight into the camera and hurled a rotten egg at it, leaving a gelatinous, opaque ooze on the lens for a few moments.  In his memoir, Bu\u00f1uel recalled that after the initial screening, painter Diego Rivera's wife Frida Kahlo refused to speak to him, while poet Le\u00f3n Felipe's wife had to be restrained physically from attacking him.  There were even calls to have Bu\u00f1uel's Mexican citizenship revoked.  Dancigers, panicked by what he feared would be a complete debacle, quickly commissioned an alternate \"happy\" ending to the film, and also tacked on a preface showing stock footage of the skylines of New York, London and Paris with voice-over commentary to the effect that behind the wealth of all the great cities of the world can be found poverty and malnourished children, and that Mexico City \"that large modern city, is no exception\".  Regardless, attendance was so poor that Dancigers withdrew the film after only three days in theaters.Through the determined efforts of future Nobel Prize winner for Literature Octavio Paz, who at the time was in Mexico's diplomatic service, Los olvidados was chosen to represent Mexico at the Cannes Film Festival of 1951, and Paz promoted the film assiduously by distributing a supportive manifesto and parading outside the cinema with a placard.  Opinion in general was enthusiastic, with the Surrealists (Breton and poet Jacques Prevert) and other artistic intellectuals (painter Marc Chagall and poet/dramatist/filmmaker Jean Cocteau) laudatory, but the communists objected to what they saw as the film's \"bourgeois morality\" for containing a scene in which the police stop a pederast from assaulting a child.  Bu\u00f1uel won the Best Director prize that year at Cannes, and also won the FIPRESCI International Critics' Award.  After receiving these accolades, the film was reissued in Mexico where it ran for two months to much greater acceptance and profit.  Los olvidados and its triumph at Cannes made Bu\u00f1uel an instant world celebrity and the most important Spanish-speaking film director in the world.  In 2003, Los olvidados was recommended by UNESCO for inclusion in the Memory of the World Register, calling it: \"the most important document in Spanish about the marginal lives of children in contemporary large cities\".\n\nBu\u00f1uel remained in Mexico for the rest of his life, although he spent periods of time filming in France and Spain. In Mexico, he filmed 21 films during an 18-year period.  For many critics, although there were occasional widely acknowledged masterpieces like Los olvidados and \u00c9l (1953), the majority of his output consisted of generic fare which was adapted to the norms of the national film industry, frequently adopting melodramatic conventions that appealed to local tastes.  Other commentators, however, have written of the deceptive complexity and intensity of many of these films, arguing that, collectively, they, \"bring a philosophical depth and power to his cinema, together offering a sustained meditation on ideas of religion, class inequity, violence and desire\". Although Bu\u00f1uel usually had little choice regarding the selection of these projects, they often deal with themes that were central to his lifelong concerns:\nsexual pathology:  \u00c9l (1953), Ensayo de un crimen (1955), and Abismos de pasi\u00f3n (1954)\nthe destructive effects of rampant machismo: El Bruto, (1953), El r\u00edo y la muerte, (1955);\nthe blurring of fantasy and reality: Subida al cielo (1952), La ilusi\u00f3n viaja en tranv\u00eda (1954);\nthe disruptive status of women in a male-dominated culture: Susana (1951), La hija del enga\u00f1o (1951\u2014a remake of the Film\u00f3fono production Don Quint\u00edn el amargao of 16 years earlier), Una mujer sin amor (1952); and\nthe absurdity of the religious life: Nazar\u00edn (1959) and Sim\u00f3n del desierto (1965).As busy as he was during the 1950s and early 1960s, there were still many film projects that Bu\u00f1uel had to abandon due to lack of financing or studio support, including a cherished plan to film Mexican novelist Juan Rulfo's Pedro P\u00e1ramo, of which he said how much he enjoyed \"the crossing from the mysterious to the real, almost without transition.  I really like this mixture of reality and fantasy,  but I don't know how to bring it to the screen.\"  Other unrealized projects during his lifetime included adaptations of Andr\u00e9 Gide's Les caves du Vatican; Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s's Fortunata y Jacinta, Do\u00f1a Perfecta, and \u00c1ngel Guerra; Evelyn Waugh's The Loved One; William Golding's Lord of the Flies; Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun; J. K. Huysmans' L\u00e0-Bas; Matthew Lewis's The Monk; Jos\u00e9 Donoso's Lugar sin l\u00edmites; a film of four stories based on Carlos Fuentes's Aura; and Julio Cort\u00e1zar's Las m\u00e9nades.\n\n\n==== Mexico and beyond: return to international filmmaking (1954\u20131960) ====\n\nAs much as he welcomed steady employment in the Mexican film industry, Bu\u00f1uel was quick to seize opportunities to re-emerge onto the international film scene and to engage with themes that were not necessarily focused on Mexican preoccupations.  His first chance came in 1954, when Dancigers partnered with Henry F. Ehrlich, of United Artists, to co-produce a film version of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, using a script developed by the Canadian writer Hugo Butler.  The film was produced by George Pepper, the former executive secretary of the Hollywood Democratic Committee.  Both Butler and Pepper were emigres from Hollywood who had run afoul of authorities seeking out communists.   The result, Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, was Bu\u00f1uel's first color film.  Bu\u00f1uel was given much more time than usual for the filming (three months), which was accomplished on location in Manzanillo, a Pacific seaport with a lush jungle interior, and was shot simultaneously in English and Spanish.  When the film was released in the United States, its young star Dan O'Herlihy used his own money to fund a Los Angeles run for the film and gave free admission to all members of the Screen Actors Guild, who in turn rewarded the little-known actor with his only Oscar nomination.In the mid-1950s, Bu\u00f1uel got the chance to work again in France on international co-productions.  The result was what critic Raymond Durgnat has called the director's \"revolutionary triptych\", in that each of the three films is \"openly, or by implication, a study in the morality and tactics of armed revolution against a right-wing dictatorship\".  The first, Cela s'appelle l'aurore (Franco-Italian, 1956) required Bu\u00f1uel and the \"pataphysical\" writer Jean Ferry to adapt a novel by Emmanuel Robl\u00e8s after the celebrated writer Jean Genet failed to deliver a script after having been paid in full.  The second film was La Mort en ce jardin (Franco-Mexican, 1956), which was adapted by Bu\u00f1uel and his frequent collaborator Luis Alcoriza from a novel by the Belgian writer Jos\u00e9-Andr\u00e9 Lacour.  The final part of the \"triptych\" was La Fi\u00e8vre Monte \u00e0 El Pao (Franco-Mexican, 1959), the last film of the popular French star G\u00e9rard Philipe, who died in the final stages of the production. At one point during the filming, Bu\u00f1uel asked Philipe, who was visibly dying of cancer, why the actor was making this film, and Philipe responded by asking the director the same question, to which both said they didn't know. Bu\u00f1uel was later to explain that he was so strapped for cash that he, \"took everything that was offered to me, as long as it wasn't humiliating\".In 1960, Bu\u00f1uel re-teamed with scenarist Hugo Butler and organizer George Pepper, allegedly his favorite producer,  to make his second English-language film, a US/Mexico co-production called The Young One, based on a short story by writer and former CIA-agent Peter Matthiessen.  This film has been called \"a surprisingly uncompromising study of racism and sexual desire, set on a remote island in the Deep South\" and has been described by critic Ed Gonzalez as, \"salacious enough to make Elia Kazan's Baby Doll and Luis Malle's Pretty Baby blush\".  Although the film won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival for its treatment of racial discrimination, the US critics were so hostile upon its release that Bu\u00f1uel was later to say that, \"a Harlem newspaper even wrote that I should be hung upside down from a lamppost on Fifth Avenue....I made this film with love, but it never had a chance.\"  In the words of film historian Peter Harcourt: \"if The Young One must still be considered a 'bad' film by conventional standards, then it is one of the most subtle, most challenging and most distinguished bad films ever made.\"\n\n\n=== Late international period (1961\u20131977) ===\nAt the 1960 Cannes Festival, Bu\u00f1uel was approached by the young director Carlos Saura, whose film Los Golfos had been entered officially to represent Spain.  Two years earlier, Saura had partnered with Juan Antonio Bardem and Luis Garc\u00eda Berlanga to form a production company called UNINCI, and the group was keen to get Bu\u00f1uel to make a new film in his native country as part of their overall goal of creating a uniquely Spanish brand of cinema. At the same time, Mexican actress Silvia Pinal was eager to work with Bu\u00f1uel and talked her producer-husband Gustavo Alatriste into providing additional funding for the project with the understanding that the director, who Pinal described as \"a man worshiped and idolized\", would be given \"absolute freedom\" in carrying out the work. Finally, Bu\u00f1uel agreed to work again in Spain when further support was provided by producer Pere Portabella's company Film 59.Bu\u00f1uel and his co-scenarist Julio Alejandro drafted a preliminary screenplay for Viridiana, which critic Andrew Sarris has described as incorporating \"a plot which is almost too lurid to synopsize even in these enlightened times\", dealing with rape, incest, hints of necrophilia, animal cruelty and sacrilege, and dutifully submitted it to the Spanish censor, who, to the surprise of nearly everyone, approved it after requesting only minor modifications and one significant change to the ending. Although Bu\u00f1uel accommodated the censor's demands, he came up with a final scene that was even more provocative than the scene it replaced: \"even more immoral\", as Bu\u00f1uel was later to observe. Since Bu\u00f1uel had more than adequate resources, top-flight technical and artistic crews, and experienced actors, filming of Viridiana (which took place on location and at Bardem's studios in Madrid) went smoothly and quickly.Bu\u00f1uel submitted a cutting copy to the censors and then arranged for his son, Juan Luis, to smuggle the negatives to Paris for the final editing and mixing, ensuring that the authorities would not have an opportunity to view the finished product before its planned submission as Spain's official entry to the 1961 Cannes Festival. Spain's director general of cinematography Jos\u00e9 Munoz-Fontan presented the film on the last day of the festival and then, on the urging of Portabella and Bardem, appeared in person to accept the top prize, the Palme d'Or, which the film shared with the French entry Une aussi longue absence, directed by Henri Colpi. Within days, l'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official organ, denounced the film as an insult not only to Catholicism but to Christianity in general.   Consequences to nearly all concerned were swift: Munoz-Fontan was cashiered from his government post, the film was banned in Spain for the next 17 years, all mention of it in the press was prohibited, and the two Spanish production companies UNINCI and Film 59 were disbanded.\n\nBu\u00f1uel went on to make two more films in Mexico with Pinal and Alatriste, El \u00e1ngel exterminador (1962) and Sim\u00f3n del desierto (1965)\u2014 along with Viridiana, they form the so-called \"Bu\u00f1uelian trilogy\" \u2014 and was later to say that Alatriste had been the one producer who gave him the most freedom in creative expression.In 1963, actor Fernando Rey, one of the stars of Viridiana, introduced Bu\u00f1uel to producer Serge Silberman, a Polish entrepreneur who had fled to Paris when his family died in the Holocaust and had worked with several renowned French directors, including Jean-Pierre Melville, Jacques Becker, Marcel Camus and Christian-Jaque. Silberman proposed that the two make an adaptation of Octave Mirbeau's Journal d'une femme de chambre, which Bu\u00f1uel had read several times. Bu\u00f1uel wanted to do the filming in Mexico with Pinal, but Silberman insisted it be done in France.Pinal was so determined to work again with Bu\u00f1uel that she was ready to move to France, learn the language and even work for nothing in order to get the part of C\u00e9lestine, the title character. Silberman, however, wanted French actress Jeanne Moreau to play the role, so he put Pinal off by telling her that Moreau, too, was willing to act with no fee. Ultimately, Silberman got his way, leaving Pinal so disappointed that she was later to claim that Alatriste's failure to help her secure this part led to the breakup of their marriage. When Bu\u00f1uel requested a French-speaking writer with whom to collaborate on the screenplay, Silberman suggested the 32-year-old Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re, an actor whose previous screenwriting credits included only a few films for the comic star/director Pierre \u00c9taix, but once Bu\u00f1uel learned that Carri\u00e8re was the scion of a wine-growing family, the newcomer was hired on the spot. At first, Carri\u00e8re found it difficult to work with Bu\u00f1uel, because the young man was so deferential to the famous director that he never challenged any of Bu\u00f1uel's ideas, until, at Bu\u00f1uel's covert insistence, Silberman told Carri\u00e8re to stand up to Bu\u00f1uel now and then; as Carri\u00e8re was later to say: \"In a way, Bu\u00f1uel needed an opponent. He didn't need a secretary \u2013 he needed someone to contradict him and oppose him and to make suggestions.\" The finished 1964 film, Diary of a Chambermaid, became the first of several to be made by the team of Bu\u00f1uel, Carri\u00e8re and Silberman.  Carri\u00e8re was later to say: \"Without me and without Serge Silberman, the producer, perhaps Bu\u00f1uel would not have made so many films after he was 65. We really encouraged him to work. That's for sure.\" \nThis was the second attempt to film Mirbeau's novel, the first being a 1946 Hollywood production directed by Jean Renoir, which Bu\u00f1uel refused to view for fear of being influenced by the famous French director, whom he venerated. Bu\u00f1uel's version, while admired by many, has often been compared unfavorably to Renoir's, with a number of critics claiming that Renoir's Diary fits better in Renoir's overall oeuvre, while Bu\u00f1uel's Diary is not sufficiently \"Bu\u00f1uelian\".After the 1964 release of Diary, Bu\u00f1uel again tried to make a film of Matthew Lewis' The Monk, a project on which he had worked, on and off, since 1938, according to producer Pierre Braunberger. He and Carri\u00e8re wrote a screenplay, but were unable to obtain funding for the project, which would be finally realized in 1973 under the direction of Bu\u00f1uel devotee Ado Kyrou, with considerable assistance from both Bu\u00f1uel and Carri\u00e8re.In 1965, Bu\u00f1uel managed to work again with Sylvia Pinal in what would turn out to be his last Mexican feature, co-starring Claudio Brook, Sim\u00f3n del desierto. Pinal was keenly interested in continuing to work with Bu\u00f1uel, trusting him completely and frequently stating that he brought out the best in her; however, this would be their last collaboration.\n\nIn 1966, Bu\u00f1uel was contacted by the Hakim brothers, Robert and Raymond, Egyptian-French producers who specialized in sexy films directed by star filmmakers, who offered him the opportunity to direct a film version of Joseph Kessel's novel Belle de Jour, a book about an affluent young woman who leads a double life as a prostitute, and that had caused a scandal upon its first publication in 1928. Bu\u00f1uel did not like Kessel's novel, considering it \"a bit of a soap opera\", but he took on the challenge because: \"I found it interesting to try to turn something I didn't like into something I did.\" So he and Carri\u00e8re set out enthusiastically to interview women in the brothels of Madrid to learn about their sexual fantasies. Bu\u00f1uel also was not happy about the choice of the 22-year-old Catherine Deneuve for the title role, feeling that she had been foisted upon him by the Hakim brothers and Deneuve's lover at the time, director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. As a result, both actress and director found working together difficult, with Deneuve claiming, \"I felt they showed more of me than they'd said they were going to. There were moments when I felt totally used. I was very unhappy,\" and Bu\u00f1uel deriding her prudery on the set. The resulting film has been described by film critic Roger Ebert as \"possibly the best-known erotic film of modern times, perhaps the best\", even though, as another critic has written, \"in terms of explicit sexual activity, there is little in Belle de jour we might not see in a Doris Day comedy from the same year\". It was Bu\u00f1uel's most successful film at the box office.Critics have noted Bu\u00f1uel's habit of following up a commercial or critical success with a more personal, idiosyncratic film that might have less chance of popular esteem.After the worldwide success of his 1967 Belle de jour, and upon viewing Jean-Luc Godard's film La Chinoise, Bu\u00f1uel, who had wanted to make a film about Catholic heresies for years, told Carri\u00e8re: \"If that is what today's cinema is like, then we can make a film about heresies.\" The two spent months researching Catholic history and created the 1969 film The Milky Way, a \"picaresque road film\" that tells the story of two vagabonds on pilgrimage to the tomb of the Apostle James at Santiago de Compostela, during which they travel through time and space to take part in situations illustrating heresies that arose from the six major Catholic dogmas. Vincent Canby, reviewing the film in the New York Times, compared it to George Stevens' blockbuster The Greatest Story Ever Told, in that Bu\u00f1uel had made a film about Jesus casting nearly all the famous French performers of the time in cameo roles. The Milky Way was banned in Italy, only to have the Catholic Church intervene on its behalf.\n\nThe 1970 film Tristana is a film about a young woman who is seduced and manipulated by her guardian, who attempts to thwart her romance with a young artist and who eventually induces her to marry him after she loses one of her legs due to a tumor. It has been considered by scholar Beth Miller the least understood of Bu\u00f1uel's films, and consequently one of the most underrated, due to a \"consistent failure to apprehend its political and, especially, its socialist-feminist statement\". Bu\u00f1uel had wanted to make a film of Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s' novel Tristana as early as 1952, even though he considered Gald\u00f3s' book the author's weakest, in Bu\u00f1uel's words: \"of the 'I love you, my little pigeon' genre, very kitsch\". After finishing Viridiana and in the wake of the scandal its release caused in 1962, the Spanish censor flatly turned down this project, and Bu\u00f1uel had to wait for 8 years before he could receive backing from the Spanish production company Epoca Films. The censors had threatened to deny permission for the film on the grounds that it encouraged duelling, so Bu\u00f1uel had to approach the subject matter very gingerly, in addition to making concessions to his French/Italian/Spanish producers, who insisted on casting two of the three primary roles with actors not of Bu\u00f1uel's choosing: Franco Nero and Catherine Deneuve. On this occasion, however, Deneuve and Bu\u00f1uel had a more mutually satisfactory working relationship, with Deneuve telling an interviewer, \"but in the end, you know, it was actually rather a wonderful shoot. Tristana is one of my favorite films. Personally, as an actress, I prefer Tristana to Belle de Jour.\"The germ of the idea for their next film together, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) came from Bu\u00f1uel and Serge Silberman discussing uncanny repetition in everyday life; Silberman told an anecdote about how he had invited some friends for dinner at his house, only to forget about it, so that, on the night of the dinner party, he was absent and his wife was in her nightclothes. The film tells of a group of affluent friends who are continually stymied in their attempts to eat a meal together, a situation that a number of critics have contrasted to the opposite dilemma of the characters in The Exterminating Angel, where guests of a dinner party are mysteriously unable to leave after having completed their meal. For this film, Bu\u00f1uel, Silberman and Carri\u00e8re assembled a top-flight cast of European performers, \"a veritable rogues' gallery of French art-house cinema\", according to one critic. For the first time, Bu\u00f1uel made use of a video-playback monitor, which allowed him to make much more extensive use of crane shots and elaborate tracking shots, and enabled him to cut the film in the camera and eliminate the need for reshoots. Filming required only two months and Bu\u00f1uel claimed that editing took only one day. When the film was released, Silberman decided to skip the Cannes Festival in order to concentrate on getting it nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, which it won, leading Bu\u00f1uel to express his contempt for a process that relied on the judgment of, \"2500 idiots, including for example the assistant dress designer of the studio\".As was his habit, Bu\u00f1uel took advantage of the popular success of Discreet Charm to make one of the \"puzzling, idiosyncratic films he really wanted to make\". In 1973, at the Monastery of Paular in the Spanish Somosierra, he wrote the screenplay for The Phantom of Liberty(1974) with Carri\u00e8re for production by Silberman and his Hollywood partners. The resulting film is a series of 12 distinctive episodes with separate protagonists, linked together only by following a character from one episode to another in a relay-race manner. Bu\u00f1uel has stated that he made the film as a tribute to poet Benjamin P\u00e9ret, a founding member of French Surrealism, and called it his \"most Surrealist film\".Bu\u00f1uel's final film was That Obscure Object of Desire (1977), adapted by Bu\u00f1uel and Carri\u00e8re from an 1898 novel by Pierre Lou\u00ffs called La Femme et le pantin, which had already been used as the basis of films directed by Josef von Sternberg (The Devil is a Woman, 1935) and Julien Duvivier (La Femme et le Pantin, 1959). The film, which tells the story of an older man who is obsessed by a young woman who continually evades his attempts to consummate a sexual relationship, starred the Spanish actor Fernando Rey, appearing in his fourth Bu\u00f1uel film. Initially, the part of the young woman was to be played by Maria Schneider, who had achieved international fame for her roles in Last Tango in Paris and The Passenger, but once shooting started, according to Carri\u00e8re, her drug usage resulted in a \"lackluster and dull\" performance that caused tempestuous arguments with Bu\u00f1uel on the set and her eventual dismissal. Serge Silberman, the producer, decided to abandon the project at that point, but was convinced by Bu\u00f1uel to continue shooting with two different actresses, \u00c1ngela Molina and Carole Bouquet playing the same role in alternating sequences throughout the film. In his autobiography, Bu\u00f1uel claimed that this unusual casting decision was his own idea after drinking two dry martinis, saying: \"If I had to list all the benefits derived from alcohol, it would be endless\". Others have reported that Carri\u00e8re had first broached the idea while developing the film's scenario, but had been brushed off by Bu\u00f1uel as \"the whim of a rainy day\".\n\n\n=== Last years (1978\u20131983) ===\n\nAfter the release of That Obscure Object of Desire, Bu\u00f1uel retired from filmmaking. In 1982, he wrote (along with Carri\u00e8re) his autobiography, Mon Dernier Soupir (My Last Sigh), which provides an account of his life, friends, and family as well as a representation of his eccentric personality. In it, he recounts dreams, encounters with many well-known writers, actors, and artists such as Pablo Picasso and Charlie Chaplin as well as antics, like dressing up as a nun and walking around town.In his seventies, Bu\u00f1uel once told his friend, novelist Carlos Fuentes: \"I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid of dying alone in a hotel room, with my bags open and a shooting script on the night table. I must know whose fingers will close my eyes.\" according to his wife Jeanne, Bu\u00f1uel died in Mexico City in 1983 by diabetes complications. Fuentes has recounted that Bu\u00f1uel spent his last week in hospital discussing theology with the Jesuit brother Julian Pablo, a long time friend. His funeral was very private, involving only family and close friends, among them poets Octavio Paz and Homero Aridjis.\n\n\n== Technique and influences ==\n\nBu\u00f1uel's technique of filmmaking was strongly influenced by mise-en-scene, sound editing and use of music. The influences on his filmmaking have included a positive relationship to surrealism and a critical approach to atheism and religion. Bu\u00f1uel's style of directing was extremely economical; he shot films in a few weeks, rarely deviating from his script (the scene in Tristana where Catherine Deneuve exposes her breasts to Saturno \u2013 but not the audience \u2013 being a noted exception) and shooting as much as possible in order to minimize editing time.   He remained true throughout his working life to an operating philosophy that he articulated at the beginning of his career in 1928:  \"The guiding idea, the silent procession of images that are concrete, decisive, measured in space and time\u2014in a word, the film\u2014was first projected inside the brain of the filmmaker\".  In this, Bu\u00f1uel has been compared with Alfred Hitchcock, another director famous for precision, efficiency and preplanning, for whom actually shooting the film was an anticlimax, since each man would know, in Bu\u00f1uel's words, \"exactly how each scene will be shot and what the final montage will be\".  According to actress Jeanne Moreau:  \"He was the only director I know who never threw away a shot. He had the film in his mind. When he said 'action' and 'cut,' you knew that what was in between the two would be printed.\"\n\n\n== Tributes ==\n\nIn 1994, a retrospective of Bu\u00f1uel's works was organized by the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle in Bonn, as homage to one of the most internationally revered figures in world cinema.   This was followed in the summer of 1996 by a commemoration of the centenary of the birth of cinema held by the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid, which included a unique retrospective, jointly sponsored by the King of Spain and the President of Mexico, called \u00bfBu\u00f1uel!. La mirada del siglo, honoring his special status as Spanish cinema's most emblematic figure.\nA secondary school in Zaragoza, Spain has been named for Bu\u00f1uel: Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Secundaria Ies Luis Bu\u00f1uel. Liceo Espa\u00f1ol Luis Bu\u00f1uel, a Spanish international school, is in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, near Paris.\nIn Calanda, Spain a bust of the head of Luis Bu\u00f1uel is on display at the Centro Bu\u00f1uel Calanda (CBC), a museum devoted to the director.  The mission of the CBC is to serve as a reference center both for connoisseurs of Bu\u00f1uel and for anyone interested in the arts of Aragon.\nOne of the main theatres at the Palais des Festivals et des Congr\u00e8s, where the Cannes Film Festival is held, is named after him: Salle Bu\u00f1uel.\nTo mark the centenary of his birth, in 2000 the Cannes festival partnered with the Spanish film industry, to pay tribute to Luis Bu\u00f1uel.  This tribute consisted of three events: (1) the inauguration, for Cannes 2000, of the Palace's new Luis Bu\u00f1uel room, (2) an original exhibition organized by L'Instituto de la Cinematograf\u00eda y de las Artes Audiovisuales entitled \"The Secret World of Bu\u00f1uel\", and (3) an exceptional projection of Viridiana, the Palme d'Or winner in 1961, in the presence of specially invited artists.\nThe Luis Bu\u00f1uel Film Institute (LBFI) is housed in the Downtown Independent Theatre, Los Angeles, and has as its mission: \"to form the vital and innovative arena for the promotion of the work of Luis Bu\u00f1uel, and a seminal resource for the development of new research, knowledge and scholarship on his life and work, extending across his body of films and writings\".\n\n\n== Characterizations ==\nBu\u00f1uel has been portrayed as a character in many films and television productions.  A portion of the television mini-series Lorca, muerte de un poeta (1987\u20131988), directed by Juan Antonio Bardem recreates the student years of Bu\u00f1uel, Lorca and Dal\u00ed, with Fernando Valverde portraying Bu\u00f1uel in two episodes.  He was played by Dimiter Guerasimof in the 1991 biopic Dal\u00ed, directed by Antoni Ribas, despite the fact that Dal\u00ed and his attorney had written to Ribas objecting to the project in its early stages in 1985.  Bu\u00f1uel appeared as a character in Alejandro Pelayo's 1993 film Miroslava, based on the life of actress Miroslava Stern, who committed suicide after appearing in Ensayo de un crimen (1955).  Bu\u00f1uel was played by three actors, El Gran Wyoming (old age), Pere Arquillu\u00e9 (young adult) and Juan Carlos Jim\u00e9nez Mar\u00edn (child), in Carlos Saura's 2001 fantasy, Bu\u00f1uel y la mesa del rey Salom\u00f3n, which tells of Bu\u00f1uel, Lorca and Dal\u00ed setting out in search of the mythical table of King Salom\u00f3n, which is thought to have the power to see into the past, the present and the future.  Bu\u00f1uel was a character in a 2001 television miniseries Severo Ochoa: La conquista de un Nobel, on the life of the Spanish \u00e9migr\u00e9 and Nobel Prize winner in medicine, who was also at the Residencia de Estudiantes during Bu\u00f1uel's time there. Matt Lucas portrayed Bu\u00f1uel in Richard Curson Smith's 2002 TV movie Surrealissimo: The Scandalous Success of Salvador Dal\u00ed, a comedy depicting Dal\u00ed's \"trial\" by the Surrealists in 1934 for his pro-Hitler sympathies.  A 2005 short called The Death of Salvador Dali, directed by Delaney Bishop, contains sequences in which Bu\u00f1uel appears, played by Alejandro Cardenas. Paul Morrison's Little Ashes hypothesizes a love affair between Dal\u00ed and Lorca, with Bu\u00f1uel (played by Matthew McNulty) looking on suspiciously. Bu\u00f1uel, played by Adrien de Van, is one of many notable personalities encountered by Woody Allen's protagonist in Midnight in Paris (2011).\n\n\n== Awards ==\nBu\u00f1uel was given the Career Golden Lion in 1982 by the Venice Film Festival and the FIPRESCI Prize \u2013 Honorable Mention in 1969 by the Berlin International Film Festival. In 1977, he received the National Prize for Arts and Sciences for Fine Arts. At the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded the Honorable Prize for his contribution to cinema.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Documentaries about Bu\u00f1uel ===\nDans l'oeil de Luis Bu\u00f1uel.

        "wiki": "The Alhambra ( (listen), Spanish: [a\u02c8lamb\u027ea]; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u200e, romanized: Al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02be, pronounced [al\u0127am\u02c8ra\u02d0\u0294], lit.\u2009'\"The Red One\"') is a palace and fortress complex located in Granada, Andalusia, Spain. It was originally constructed as a small fortress in AD 889 on the remains of Roman fortifications, and then largely ignored until its ruins were renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar of the Emirate of Granada, who built its current palace and walls with many intricate details. It was converted into a royal palace in 1333 by Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada. After the conclusion of the Christian Reconquista in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where Christopher Columbus received royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered in the Renaissance style. In 1526 Charles I & V commissioned a new Renaissance palace better befitting the Holy Roman Emperor in the revolutionary Mannerist style influenced by humanist philosophy in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid Andalusian architecture, but it was ultimately never completed due to Morisco rebellions in Granada.\nAlhambra's last flowering of Islamic palaces was built for the last Muslim emirs in Spain during the decline of the Nasrid dynasty, who were increasingly subject to the Christian Kings of Castile. After being allowed to fall into disrepair for centuries, the buildings occupied by squatters, Alhambra was rediscovered following the defeat of Napoleon, who had conducted retaliatory destruction of the site. The rediscoverers were first British intellectuals and then other north European Romantic travelers. It is now one of Spain's major tourist attractions, exhibiting the country's most significant and well-known Islamic architecture, together with 16th-century and later Christian building and garden interventions. The Alhambra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Moorish poets described it as \"a pearl set in emeralds\", an allusion to the colour of its buildings and the woods around them. The palace complex was designed with the mountainous site in mind and many forms of technology were considered. The park (Alameda de la Alhambra), which is overgrown with wildflowers and grass in the spring, was planted by the Moors with roses, oranges, and myrtles; its most characteristic feature, however, is the dense wood of English elms brought by the Duke of Wellington in 1812. The park has a multitude of nightingales and is usually filled with the sound of running water from several fountains and cascades. These are supplied through a conduit 8 km (5.0 mi) long, which is connected with the Darro at the monastery of Jesus del Valle above Granada.Despite long neglect, willful vandalism, and some ill-judged restoration, the Alhambra endures as an atypical example of Muslim art in its final European stages, relatively uninfluenced by the direct Byzantine influences found in the Mezquita of C\u00f3rdoba. Most of the palace buildings are quadrangular in plan, with all the rooms opening on to a central court, and the whole reached its present size simply by the gradual addition of new quadrangles, designed on the same principle, though varying in dimensions, and connected with each other by smaller rooms and passages. Alhambra was extended by the different Muslim rulers who lived in the complex. However, each new section that was added followed the consistent theme of \"paradise on earth\". Column arcades, fountains with running water, and reflecting pools were used to add to the aesthetic and functional complexity. In every case, the exterior was left plain and austere. Sun and wind were freely admitted. Blue, red, and a golden yellow, all somewhat faded through lapse of time and exposure, are the colors chiefly employed. The name Alhambra means the red one or the red castle, which refers to the sun-dried bricks that the outer wall is made of.The decoration consists for the upper part of the walls, as a rule, of Arabic inscriptions\u2014mostly poems by Ibn Zamrak and others praising the palace\u2014that are manipulated into geometrical patterns with vegetal background set onto an arabesque setting (\"Ataurique\"). Much of this ornament is carved stucco (plaster) rather than stone. Tile mosaics (\"alicatado\"), with complicated mathematical patterns (\"tracer\u00eda\", most precisely \"lacer\u00eda\"), are largely used as panelling for the lower part. Metal was also not present very mainly. Similar designs are displayed on wooden ceilings (Alfarje). Muqarnas are the main elements for vaulting with stucco, and some of the most accomplished dome examples of this kind are in the Court of the Lions halls. The palace complex is designed in the Nasrid style, the last blooming of Islamic Art in the Iberian Peninsula, that had a great influence on the Maghreb to the present day, and on contemporary Mudejar Art, which is characteristic of western elements reinterpreted into Islamic forms and widely popular during the Reconquista in Spain.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAlhambra derives from the Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621 al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  (f.), meaning \"the red one\", the complete form of which was \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064f al-Qal\u02bbat al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  \"the red fortress (qalat)\". The \"Al-\" in \"Alhambra\" means \"the\" in Arabic, but this is ignored in general usage in both English and Spanish, where the name is normally given the definite article.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAround the year 889, forces loyal to Umar ibn Hafsun in revolt against Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi and the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba besieged a small Islamic fortress in Granada held by Saw\u0101r Ben Hamd\u016bn. The first reference to al-\u1e24amr\u0101\u02bc  came in lines of poetry attached to an arrow shot over the ramparts, recorded by Ibn Hayyan:\n\nCompleted towards the end of Muslim rule of Spain by Yusuf I (1333\u20131353) and Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada (1353\u20131391), the Alhambra is a reflection of the culture of the last centuries of the Muslim rule of Al Andalus, reduced to the Nasrid Emirate of Granada. It is a place where artists and intellectuals had taken refuge as the Reconquista by Spanish Christians won victories over Al Andalus. The Alhambra integrates natural site qualities with constructed structures and gardens, and is a testament to Moorish culture in Spain and the skills of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian artisans, craftsmen, and builders of their era.\nThe literal translation of Alhambra, \"the red (female),\" reflects the color of the red clay of the surroundings of which the fort is made. The buildings of the Alhambra were originally whitewashed; however, the buildings as seen today are reddish. Another possible origin of the name is the tribal designation of the Nasrid Dynasty, known as the Banu al-Ahmar Arabic: Sons of the Red (male), a sub-tribe of the Arab Qahtanite Banu Khazraj tribe. One of the early Nasrid ancestors was nicknamed Yusuf Al Ahmar (Yusuf the Red) and hence the (Nasrid) fraction of the Banu Khazraj took up the name of Banu al-Ahmar.\n\nThe first reference to the Qal\u2018at al-\u1e24amra was during the battles between the Arabs and the Muladies (people of mixed Arab and European descent) during the rule of the \u2018Abdullah ibn Muhammad (r. 888\u2013912). In one particularly fierce and bloody skirmish, the Muladies soundly defeated the Arabs, who were then forced to take shelter in a primitive red castle located in the province of Elvira, presently located in Granada. According to surviving documents from the era, the red castle was quite small, and its walls were not capable of deterring an army intent on conquering. The castle was then largely ignored until the eleventh century, when its ruins were renovated and rebuilt by Samuel ibn Naghrela, vizier to the emir Badis ben Habus of the Zirid Dynasty of Al Andalus, in an attempt to preserve the small Jewish settlement also located on the natural plateau, Sabikah Hill.\nIbn Nasr, the founder of the Nasrid Dynasty, was forced to flee to Ja\u00e9n to avoid persecution by King Ferdinand III of Castile and the Reconquista supporters working to end Spain's Moorish rule. After retreating to Granada, Ibn-Nasr took up residence at the Palace of Badis ben Habus in the Alhambra. A few months later, he embarked on the construction of a new Alhambra fit for the residence of a sultan. According to an Arabic manuscript since published as the An\u00f3nimo de Granada y Copenhague,\n\nThis year, 1238 Abdallah ibn al-Ahmar climbed to the place called \"the Alhambra\" inspected it, laid out the foundations of a castle and left someone in charge of its construction...\nThe design included plans for six palaces, five of which were grouped in the northeast quadrant forming a royal quarter, two circuit towers, and numerous bathhouses. During the reign of the Nasrid Dynasty, the Alhambra was transformed into a palatine city, complete with an irrigation system composed of acequias for the gardens of the Generalife located outside the fortress. Previously, the old Alhambra structure had been dependent upon rainwater collected from a cistern and from what could be brought up from the Albaic\u00edn. The creation of the Sultan's Canal solidified the identity of the Alhambra as a palace-city rather than a defensive and ascetic structure. The hydraulic system includes two long water channels and several sophisticated elevation devices to bring water onto the plateau.\n\nThe last Nasrid sultan, Muhammad XII of Granada, surrendered the Emirate of Granada in 1492 without the Alhambra itself being attacked when the forces of the Reyes Cat\u00f3licos, King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, took the surrounding territory with a force of overwhelming numbers.\nThe decoration within the palaces comes from the last great period of Andalusian art in Granada. With little of the Byzantine influence of contemporary Abassid architecture, artists endlessly reproduced the same forms and trends, creating a new style that developed over the course of the Nasrid Dynasty. The Nasrids used freely all the stylistic elements that had been created and developed during eight centuries of Muslim rule in the Peninsula, including the Caliphate horseshoe arch, the Almohad sebka (a grid of rhombuses), the Almoravid palm, and unique combinations of them, as well as innovations such as stilted arches and muqarnas (stalactite ceiling decorations). Structurally, the design is simple and does not evince significant innovation. While artistically pleasing it was until the reconquest structurally ad hoc and reliant on the skills of subject artisans and workers.\nColumns and muqarnas appear in several chambers, and the interiors of numerous palaces are decorated with arabesques and calligraphy. The arabesques of the interior are ascribed to, among other sultans, Yusuf I, Mohammed V, and Ismail I, Sultan of Granada.\n\nAfter the Christian conquest of the city in 1492, the conquerors began to alter the Alhambra. The open work was filled up with whitewash, the painting and gilding effaced, and the furniture soiled, torn, or removed. Charles I (1516\u20131556) rebuilt portions in the Renaissance style of the period and destroyed the greater part of the winter palace to make room for a Renaissance-style structure which was never completed. Philip V (1700\u20131746) Italianised the rooms and completed his palace in the middle of what had been the Moorish building; he had partitions constructed which blocked up whole apartments.Over subsequent centuries the Moorish art was further damaged, and in 1812 some of the towers were destroyed by the French under Count Sebastiani. In 1821, an earthquake caused further damage. Restoration work was undertaken in 1828 by the architect Jos\u00e9 Contreras, endowed in 1830 by Ferdinand VII. After the death of Contreras in 1847, it was continued by his son Rafael (died 1890) and his grandson. Especially notable was the intervention of Leopoldo Torres Balb\u00e1s in the 1930s: the young architect \"opened arcades that had been walled up, re-excavated filled-in pools, replaced missing tiles, completed inscriptions that lacked portions of their stuccoed lettering, and installed a ceiling in the still unfinished palace of Charles V\".\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nAccording to the site's current architect, Pedro Salmeron Escobar, the Alhambra evolved organically over a period of several centuries from the ancient hilltop fortress defined by a narrow promontory carved by the river Darro and overlooking the Vega or Plain of Granada as it descends from the Sierra Nevada. The red earth from which the fortress is constructed is a granular aggregate held together by a medium of red clay which gives the resulting layered brick- and stone- reinforced construction (tapial calicastrado) its characteristic hue and is at the root of the name of 'the Red Hill'.This crude earthiness is counterpointed by the startling fine alabaster white stucco work of the famous interiors. Meltwater from the 'Snowy Mountains' is drawn across an arched vault at the eastern tip of the Torre del Agua ('Water Tower') and channeled through the citadel via a complex system of conduits (acequia) and water tanks (los albercones) which create the celebrated interplay of light, sound and surface.Alhambra is about 740 metres (2,430 ft) in length by 205 metres (670 ft) at its greatest width. It extends from west-northwest to east-southeast and covers an area of about 142,000 square metres (1,530,000 sq ft) or 35 acres. The Alhambra's most westerly feature is the Alcazaba (citadel), a strongly fortified position built to protect the original post-Roman districts of Iliberri, now 'Centro', and G\u00e1rnata al-yah\u016bd ('Granada of the Jews', now Realejo, and the Moorish suburb of El Albayz\u00edn.\n\nDue to touristic demand, modern access runs contrary to the original sequence which began from a principal access via the Puerta de la Justicia (Gate of Justice) onto a large souq or public market square facing the Alcazaba, now subdivided and obscured by later Christian-era development. From the Puerta del Vino (Wine Gate) ran the Calle Real (Royal Street) dividing the Alhambra along its axial spine into a southern residential quarter, with mosques, hamams (bathhouses) and diverse functional establishments, and a greater northern portion, occupied by several palaces of the nobility with extensive landscaped gardens commanding views over the Albayzin. All of this was subservient to the great Tower of the Ambassadors in the Palacio Comares, which acted as the royal audience chamber and throne room with its three arched windows dominating the city. The private, internalised universe of the Palacio de Los Leones (Palace of the Lions) adjoins the public spaces at right angles (see Plan illustration) but was originally connected only by the function of the Royal Baths, the Eye of Aixa's Room serving as the exquisitely decorated focus of meditation and authority overlooking the refined garden of Lindaraja/Daraxa toward the city.The rest of the plateau comprises a number of earlier and later Moorish palaces, enclosed by a fortified wall, with thirteen defensive towers, some such as the Torres de la Infanta and Cattiva containing elaborate vertical palaces in miniature. The river Darro passes through a ravine on the north and divides the plateau from the Albaic\u00edn district of Granada. Similarly, the Assabica Valley, containing the Alhambra Park, lies on the west and south, and, beyond this valley, the almost parallel ridge of Monte Mauror separates it from the Antequeruela district. Another ravine separates it from the Generalife, the summer pleasure gardens of the emir. Escobar notes that the later planting of deciduous elms obscures the overall perception of the layout, so a better reading of the original landscape is given in winter when the trees are bare.\n\n\n== Main structures ==\n\nThe Alhambra resembles many medieval Christian strongholds in its threefold arrangement as a castle, a palace and a residential annex for subordinates. The alcazaba or citadel, its oldest part, is built on the isolated and precipitous foreland which terminates the plateau on the northwest. All that remains are its massive outer walls, towers and ramparts. On its watchtower, the 25 m (85 ft) high Torre de la Vela, the flag of Ferdinand and Isabella was first raised as a symbol of the Spanish conquest of Granada on 2 January 1492. A turret containing a large bell was added in the 18th century and restored after being damaged by lightning in 1881. Beyond the Alcazaba is the palace of the Moorish rulers, The Nasrid Palaces or Alhambra proper, and beyond this is the Alhambra Alta (Upper Alhambra), originally occupied by officials and courtiers.\nAccess from the city to the Alhambra Park is afforded by the Puerta de las Granadas (Gate of Pomegranates), a triumphal arch dating from the 15th century. A steep ascent leads past the Pillar of Charles V, a fountain erected in 1554, to the main entrance of the Alhambra. This is the Puerta de la Justicia (Gate of Justice), a massive horseshoe archway surmounted by a square tower and used by the Moors as an informal court of justice. The hand of Fatima, with fingers outstretched as a talisman against the evil eye, is carved above this gate on the exterior; a key, the symbol of authority, occupies the corresponding place on the interior. A narrow passage leads inward to the Plaza de los Aljibes (Place of the Cisterns), a broad open space which divides the Alcazaba from the Moorish palace. To the left of the passage rises the Torre del Vino (Wine Tower), built in 1345 and used in the 16th century as a cellar. On the right is the palace of Charles V, a smaller Renaissance building, to construct which part of the Alhambra, including the original main entrance, was torn down.\n\n\n=== Royal complex ===\n\nThe Royal Complex (Plaza de Nazar\u00edes) consists of three main parts: Mexuar, Serallo, and the Harem. The Mexuar is modest in decor and houses the functional areas for conducting business and administration. Strapwork is used to decorate the surfaces in Mexuar. The ceilings, floors, and trim are made of dark wood and are in sharp contrast to white, plaster walls. Serallo, built during the reign of Yusuf I in the 14th century, contains the Patio de los Arrayanes (Court of the Myrtles). Brightly colored interiors featured dado panels, yeser\u00eda, azulejo, cedar, and artesonado. Artesonado are highly decorative ceilings and other woodwork. Lastly, the Harem is also elaborately decorated and contains the living quarters for the wives and mistresses of the Arab monarchs. This area contains a bathroom with running water (cold and hot), baths, and pressurized water for showering. The bathrooms were open to the elements in order to allow in light and air.\n\n\n=== Court of the Myrtles ===\n\nThe present entrance to the Palacio \u00c1rabe (Arab palace), or Casa Real, is by a small door from which a corridor connects to the Patio de los Arrayanes (Court of the Myrtles), also called the Patio de la Alberca (Court of the Blessing or Court of the Pond), from the Arabic birka, \"pool\". The birka helped to cool the palace and acted as a symbol of power. Because water was usually in short supply, the technology required to keep these pools full was expensive and difficult. This court is 42 m (140 ft) long by 22 m (74 ft) broad, and in the centre there is a large pond set in the marble pavement, full of goldfish, and with myrtles growing along its sides. There are galleries on the north and south sides; the southern gallery is 7 m (23 ft) high and supported by a marble colonnade. Underneath it, to the right, was the principal entrance, and over it are three windows with arches and miniature pillars. From this court, the walls of the Torre de Comares are seen rising over the roof to the north and reflected in the pond.\n\n\n=== Hall of the Ambassadors ===\n\nThe Sal\u00f3n de los Embajadores (Hall of the Ambassadors) is the largest room in the Alhambra and occupies all the Torre de Comares. It is a square room, the sides being 12 m (37 ft) in length, while the centre of the dome is 23 m (75 ft) high. This was the grand reception room, and the throne of the sultan was placed opposite the entrance. The grand hall projects from the walls of the palace, providing views in three directions. In this sense, it was a \"mirador\" from which the palace's inhabitants could gaze outward to the surrounding landscape.  The tiles are nearly 4 ft (1.2 m) high all round, and the colours vary at intervals. Over them is a series of oval medallions with inscriptions, interwoven with flowers and leaves. There are nine windows, three on each facade, and the ceiling is decorated with white, blue and gold inlays in the shape of circles, crowns and stars. The walls are covered with varied stucco works, surrounding many ancient escutcheons.\n\n\n=== Court of the Lions and fountain ===\n\nThe Court of the Lions (Patio de los Leones) is an oblong courtyard, 116 ft (35 m) in length by 66 ft (20 m) in width, surrounded by a low gallery supported on 124 white marble columns. A pavilion projects into the court at each extremity, with filigree walls and a light domed roof. The square is paved with coloured tiles and the colonnade with white marble, while the walls are covered 5 ft (1.5 m) up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles, with a border above and below of enamelled blue and gold. The columns supporting the roof and gallery are irregularly placed. They are adorned by varieties of foliage, etc.; about each arch there is a large square of stucco arabesques; and over the pillars is another stucco square of filigree work.\n\n\n==== Fountain of the Lions ====\nIn the centre of the court is the Fountain of the Lions, an alabaster basin supported by the figures of twelve lions in white marble, not designed with sculptural accuracy but as symbols of strength, power, and sovereignty. Each hour one lion would produce water from its mouth. At the edge of the great fountain there is a poem written by Ibn Zamrak. This praises the beauty of the fountain and the power of the lions, but it also describes their ingenious hydraulic systems and how they actually worked, which baffled all those who saw them.\n\n\n=== Hall of the Abencerrajes ===\n\nThe Sala de los Abencerrajes (Hall of the Abencerrages) derives its name from a legend according to which the father of Boabdil, the last sultan of Granada, having invited the chiefs of that line to a banquet, massacred them here. This room is a perfect square, with a lofty dome and trellised windows at its base. The roof is decorated in blue, brown, red and gold, and the columns supporting it spring out into the arch form in a remarkably beautiful manner. Opposite to this hall is the Sala de las dos Hermanas (Hall of the two Sisters), so-called from two white marble slabs laid as part of the pavement. These slabs measure 500 by 220 cm (15 by 7\u00bd ft). There is a fountain in the middle of this hall, and the roof \u2013 a dome honeycombed with tiny cells, all different, and said to number 5000 \u2013 is an example of the \"stalactite vaulting\" of the Moors.\n\n\n=== Generalife ===\n\nOf the outlying buildings connected to the Alhambra, the foremost in interest is the Palacio de Generalife or Gineralife (the Muslim Jennat al Arif, \"Garden of Arif,\" or \"Garden of the Architect\"). This villa dates from the beginning of the 14th century but has been restored several times. The Villa de los Martires (Martyrs' Villa), on the summit of Monte Mauror, commemorates by its name the Christian slaves who were forced to build the Alhambra and confined here in subterranean cells. The Torres Bermejas (Vermilion Towers), also on Monte Mauror, are a well-preserved Moorish fortification, with underground cisterns, stables, and accommodation for a garrison of 200 men. Several Roman tombs were discovered in 1829 and 1857 at the base of Monte Mauror.\n\n\n=== Other features ===\nAmong the other features of the Alhambra are the Sala de la Justicia (Hall of Justice), the Patio del Mexuar (Court of the Council Chamber), the Patio de Daraxa (Court of the Vestibule), and the Peinador de la Reina (Queen's Robing Room), in which there is similar architecture and decoration. The palace and the Upper Alhambra also contain baths, rows of bedrooms and summer-rooms, a whispering gallery and labyrinth, and vaulted sepulchres.\nThe original furniture of the palace is represented by one of the famous Alhambra vases, very large Hispano-Moresque ware vases made in the Sultanate to stand in niches around the palace. These famous examples of Hispano-Moresque ware date from the 14th and 15th centuries. The one remaining in the palace, from about 1400, is 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) high; the background is white and the decoration is blue, white and gold.\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\n\n=== In literature ===\n\nParts of the following works are set in the Alhambra:\n\nWashington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra. This is a collection of essays, verbal sketches, and stories. Irving lived in the palace while writing the book and was instrumental in introducing the site to Western audiences.\nSalman Rushdie's The Moor's Last Sigh\nAmin Maalouf's Leo Africanus, depicting the reconquest of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs.\nPhilippa Gregory's The Constant Princess, depicting Catalina the Infanta of Spain as she lived in the Alhambra after her parents took Granada.\nFederico Garc\u00eda Lorca's play Do\u00f1a Rosita the Spinster, mentioned by title character Do\u00f1a Rosita in her song/speech to the Manola sisters.\nPaulo Coelho's novel The Alchemist\nAli Smith's The Accidental\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's play Man and Superman\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai's Seiobo There Below\nHanya Yanagihara's A Little Life\n\n\n=== In music ===\nThe plot of the Ballet-h\u00e9ro\u00efque entitled Za\u00efde, Reine De Grenade, by the French Baroque composer Joseph-Nicolas-Pancrace Royer (c. 1705\u20131755), takes place at the Alhambra. Alhambra has directly inspired musical compositions as Francisco T\u00e1rrega's famous tremolo study for guitar Recuerdos De La Alhambra. Claude Debussy's piece for two pianos composed in 1901, Lindaraja, and the prelude, La Puerta Del Vino, from the second book of preludes composed from 1912 to 1913. Isaac Alb\u00e9niz wrote a piano suite Recuerdos De viaje, which included a piece called \"En La Alhambra\", while his suite Iberia contained a piece called \"El Albacin\". Alb\u00e9niz also composed an uncompleted Suite Alhambra.\n\n\"En Los Jardines Del Generalife\", the first movement of Manuel de Falla's Noches En Los Jardines De Espa\u00f1a, and other pieces by composers such as Ruperto Chap\u00ed (Los Gnomos De La Alhambra, 1891), Tom\u00e1s Bret\u00f3n, and many others are included in a stream referred to by scholars as Alhambrismo.In 1976, filmmaker Christopher Nupen filmed The Song of the Guitar at the Alhambra which was an hour-long program featuring the legendary Spanish guitarist, Andr\u00e9s Segovia.\nBritish composer Peter Seabourne wrote an extended piano cycle Steps Volume 3: Arabesques (2008-2012) based on shared experiences of the Alhambra with his painter aunt Ann Seabourne, and a movement from his Steps Volume 1 is entitled \"El Suspiro del Moro\" inspired by the legend of the expulsion of the last Moorish King of Granada. Julian Anderson wrote an orchestral piece, Alhambra Fantasy.\nIn pop and folk music, Alhambra is the subject of the Ghymes song of the same name. The rock band Grateful Dead released a song called \"Terrapin Station\" on the 1977 album of the same name. It consisted of a series of small compositions penned by Robert Hunter and put to music by Jerry Garcia; a lyrical section of this suite was called \"Alhambra\". In September 2006, Canadian singer/composer Loreena McKennitt performed live at the Alhambra. The resulting video recordings premiered on PBS and were later released as a 3-disc DVD/CD set called Nights from the Alhambra. The Basque pop group Mocedades performed a song called \"Juntos En La Alhambra\". Alhambra is the title of an EP recording by Canadian rock band, The Tea Party, containing acoustic versions of a few of their songs. Alhambra and Albaic\u00edn are mentioned in the M\u00e4go de Oz song named \"El Paseo De Los Tristes\" from the album entitled Gaia II. On California rapper Dom Kennedy's 2015 album By Dom Kennedy, there is a song entitled \"Alhambra\".\n\n\n=== In mathematics ===\n\nThe Alhambra tiles are remarkable in that they contain nearly all, if not all, of the seventeen mathematically possible wallpaper groups. This is a unique accomplishment in world architecture. M. C. Escher's visit in 1922 and study of the Moorish use of symmetries in the Alhambra tiles inspired his subsequent work on tessellation, which he called \"regular divisions of the plane\".\n\n\n=== In film ===\nMarcel L'Herbier's 1921 film El Dorado features many scenes shot in and around the Alhambra palace. This was the first time permission had been granted for a feature film company to shoot inside the Alhambra palace and L'Herbier gave prominent place to its gardens, fountains and geometric architectural patterns, which became some of the film's most memorable images.\nAnimated films by Spanish director Juan Bautista Berasategui such as Ahmed, El Principe De La Alhambra and El Embrujo Del Sur are based on stories in Washington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra.\nColumbus interview with Queen Isabella in Conquest of Paradise representing Granada after the Reconquest were filmed at Alhambra. As well as the Palace Scenes of Kingdom of Heaven representing Jerusalem during the Cruzades.

        "wiki": "Sierra Nevada  (Spanish: [\u02c8sjera ne\u02c8\u03b2a\u00f0a]; meaning \"mountain range covered in snow\") is a mountain range in the region of Andalucia, in the province of Granada and, a little further, M\u00e1laga and Almer\u00eda in Spain. It contains the highest point of continental Spain: Mulhac\u00e9n, at 3,479 metres (11,414 ft) above sea level.\nIt is a popular tourist destination, as its high peaks make skiing possible in one of Europe's most southerly ski resorts, in an area along the Mediterranean Sea predominantly known for its warm temperatures and abundant sunshine. At its foothills is found the city of Granada and, a little further, Almer\u00eda and M\u00e1laga.\nParts of the range have been included in the Sierra Nevada National Park. The range has also been declared a biosphere reserve. The Sierra Nevada Observatory and the IRAM radiotelescope are located on the northern slopes at an elevation of 2,800 metres (9,200 ft).\n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe Sierra Nevada was formed during the Alpine Orogeny, a mountain-building event that also formed the European Alps to the east and the Atlas Mountains of northern Africa across the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Sierra as observed today formed during the Paleogene and Neogene Periods (66 to 1.8 million years ago) from the collision of the African and Eurasian continental plates.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCentral to the mountain range is a ridge running broadly west-south-west - east-north-east. For a substantial distance, the watershed stays consistently above 3,000 metres (9,800 ft).\nOn the southern side of the range, several long, (but) narrow river valleys lead off towards the south-west, separated by a number of subsidiary ridges.\nOn the steeper and craggier northern side, the valleys have less regular orientations. This side is dominated by the Rio Genil which starts near Mulhac\u00e9n and into which many of the other rivers flow.\n\n\n=== Highest peaks ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Sierra Nevada has a Mediterranean subalpine climate (Dsc), due to the location's high elevation and low summer precipitation. With June and September being around the threshold of 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) in mean temperature to avoid the subarctic classification, the climate at a slightly lower elevation is continental highland climate. At an elevation slightly lower than that classification area; where February means average above \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F); it falls into the normal cool-summer mediterranean classification transitioning with the hot-summer variety in surrounding lowland areas. This renders Sierra Nevada's climate a highland cooled-down variety of a typical mediterranean climate. Summer and winter daytime temperatures are some 12\u00b0 C cooler than found in Granada, differences that are even greater in spring as Sierra Nevada takes longer to approach the short summers. In May daytime highs in Sierra Nevada are around 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) with Granada having an average of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). The yearly temperature of 3.9 \u00b0C (39.0 \u00b0F) is in stark contrast to Granada's 15.7 \u00b0C (60.3 \u00b0F) and coastal M\u00e1laga's 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSierra Nevada Ski Station\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlpujarras\nBaetic System\nSierra Nevada National Park\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFrancisco P\u00e9rez Raya, Joaqu\u00edn Molero Mesa, Francisco Valle Tendero, 1992: \"Parque Natural de Sierra Nevada.

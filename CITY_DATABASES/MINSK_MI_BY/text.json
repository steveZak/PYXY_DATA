        "wiki": "Minsk (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a [m\u02b2insk], Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) is the capital and largest city of Belarus, located on the Svisla\u010d and the Nyamiha Rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums.

Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, Smolensk, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nAccording to the survey in 2019 (were interviewed 1934 people), in Minsk around 811 thousand of adult bicycles plus 232 thousand of child and adolescent bicycles. In Minsk one bike is for 1.9 people. The total number of bicycles in Minsk exceeds the total number of Cars (770 thousand of personal automobiles). 39% of Minsk residents have a personal bike. 43% of Minsk residents ride a bicycle once a month or more. As of 2017, the level of bicycle use is about 1% of all transport movements (for comparison: 12% in Berlin, 50% in Copenhagen).\n\nSince 2015, a bicycle parade / bicycle carnival held in Minsk, during which vehicles are blocked for several hours along Pobediteley (Peramohi) Avenue (one of the main streets of Minsk). The number of participants in 2019 was more than 20 thousand, the number of registrations was about 12 thousand.In 2017, the European Union funded the project \"Urban cycling in Belarus\" in the amount of 560 thousand euros, within the framework of which the public association Minsk Cycling Society together with the Council of Ministers created the regulatory document National Concept for the Development of Cycling in Belarus.\n\nSince 2013, a free public workshop \"Bicycle Kitchen Garage 38\" has been operating in Minsk, where everyone can use the tool and help repairing the bicycle. Free bike school works.In 2020, Minsk entered the top 3 most cycling cities in the CIS \u2013 after Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nMinsk National Airport is located 42 km (26 mi) to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current railway station opened in 1987. It is an international airport with flights to Europe and the Middle East.Minsk-1 opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1 million passengers a year.From 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, Kiev and Kaliningrad. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as Minsk-City.Minsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is located in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges, and 29 higher education institutions, including 12 major national universities.\n\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\nAcademy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

          "I was lucky to have the possibility to visit the former building and exposition of this museum, created yet in Soviet times. I know how much efforts and funds were spent to create the new building. thus I waited more, I have to admit - since the museum is new it could be",
          "Fantastic exhibition and place overall. A lot of info and documents regarding sensitive 2WW topic. Victory Hall is truly beatuful.",
          "It was 1 January so I checked the website and it gave no suggestion that it wouldn\u2019t be following its normal Tuesday opening hours. Having made the trek up there through the billowing snow I was hugely disappointed to find it closed. I wasn\u2019t the only one, there was a steady",
          "Very big and interesting museum of war. There are no guides in English, just audio guide for 4 byr. You need minimum ~ 3 hours to see everything.",
          "A nice museum to see the second world war through the eyes of the locals. The signs were in English as well.",
          "When in Minsk, need to visit this museum. Not so touchy as I would expect, but installations are authentic, logically situated, corridors clean.",
          "Nice exhibits although the tanks presented are somewhat \"common\" - T-34, IS-2, PzKpfw III. That being said, the museum is recently renovated and all the exhibits are very well presented. I am subtracting two stars for an apparent lack of mention of Molotov-Ribbentrop pact which",
          "This is a dramatic building that I will admit to seeing from the outside only. However, even this was of great interest. The structure resembles a sun dial as if it were marking time - or history. The building is a mix of stone and glass that mixes engraved historic expression",
          "Quite a number of replicas and a bit patriotic but can you blame them?!? Perfect to keep you entertained for half a day.",
          "Very interesting and atractiv museum. Some evaluation (of course) problematic, questionable..(Hitler-Stalin agreement, aggression against Finland, Poland, Baltic States, Romania etc.). But in totall interesting.",
          "This museum really presents what the Belarus people went through during world war 2. Lots of documentation, translates to English.",
          "Recommended :) Really nice museum to visit in Minsk. A lot of history information, a lot of war equipment.",
          "This museum is well presented and illustrated with display of real tanks planes and weapons used at war and written English, not just Russian. I also hired the audio device which had quite a long explanation of what was visualised. There's a souvenir shop which has quite good",
          "In the museum there is not only cool installations about an on-site battlefields, trenches, war time paramedic stations, etc, but it also features stories and personal stuff from normal people and even civilians during the war. There are also several tanks and planes used in the",
          "One of the top war museums i have personally visited!Is enormous so you need few hours to explore it properly.For non russian speaking visitors the audio guide can make big difference so i recommend it!The museum sets different times of the war in different sectors so is easy",
          "Came here on recent trip to Minsk on an early Sunday morning. Unfortunately the building was not yet open but I was able to walk up to the exterior monument and walk around the outside to appreciate the monument. It was well worth the walk to the top and I\u2019m really sorry I could",
          "that was really shocking and i was totally touched. losing a lot of people many many civilians on war is the worst thing can ever happen to a country. God bless them all. hope every war in every place of the world finishes one day. the outside architecture was fascinating.",
          "Fascinating architecture hosting a fascinating museum depicting the hardship and atrocities suffered by Belarus during the 2nd WW. The stained glass dome at the top is very moving and a beautiful ending to what can be a dark emotional exhibition.",
          "Wasn\u00b4t in my plans enter in, have seen some museums about World War II, on this trip. Then, just stayed outside, enjoying the place. It\u00b4s a beautiful and amazing structure, with nice views of the city. You can continue around to see Walk of Fame, Victory Fountain and park, just",
          "Having seen such museums in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Volgograd (Russia) and Kiev in Ukraine, the collection in Minsk is equally as good. Finally great to see a special dedication to the Partisans who inflicted sizeable losses upon the Nazis in Belarus. A thoughtful and harrowing",
          "As in any other Patriotic War Museum in a Soviet Country, this is an outstanding museum. Recently renovated, the museum presents a full exhibition on the war. Very well organized and displayed. A must visit when in Minsk. The shop has also some nice propaganda posters.",
          "A must see and one of Mink's standout attractions showcasing its tragic WW2 history complete with Soviet influence making it all the more interesting.",
          "There are lots of exhibits of military equipment from guns to aircraft. It detailed the course of WW2 in Belarus and most of the exhibits had English descriptions.",
          "This museum and monument is absolutely recommended. So much interesting information all over. You can easily spend some hours here. Well organized and everything is explained in English.",
          "At first divided up by Hitler and Stalin in a secret deal, later overrun by the Nazi's who literally killed millions of people in Belarus. There are original documents, tableaux, weapons, general and personal stories and much more. The extensive English explanation guarantees",
          "This museum is really a place worth visiting. Even the building itself is worth seeing and also the park around it. Unlike many eastern european museums this has signs and explanations also in english. The exibithion itself is very nicely planned and there is lot to see but if",
          "This is a very impressive place. Belarus suffered immensely during WW2 and this museum tells the story. Lots of highly interesting and original artefacts which all have a story. I recommend to take an audioguide. One little criticism: they do not have wifi here and the cafe is",
          "Not a terrific place if you're easily overwhelmed by detail. There seems to have been an attempt by the curators to pack EVERY detail about the Belarusian WWII experience into this space. Be prepared for a lot of reading (and re-reading) since the English translation isn't",
          "Lots of interesting planes, tanks and weapons used in various wars. it is a fairly big museum with lots of displays and discussions about numerous Heroes of Russia.",
          "Very interesting and informative. With the audio guide you get drenched in information about soviet heroes, tanks, events and so on. The victory hall on the top floor was really impressive!",
          "I wonder if there are any other countries who lost greater percentage of their population in World War 2. The museum gives you an overview of the resistance and I felt great respect for the Belarusian people.",
          "Must say I was mighty impressed by the museums collection of things from WWII. There is so much to see in here and it\u2019s nicely categorised by different stages of the war. Plenty of information in English and you have an option to get an audio guide as well.",
          "Let me say first off that this is very much from the point of view of Belarus/soviet role in world war 2 if you are looking for a broad overview of the second war then this is not the museum for that. But overall excellent use of dioramas and displays, you forget exactly how big",
          "Great museum , cool to visiting the staff don\u2019t seem to like tourists but aside from that it is a well designed and nice experience.",
          "the space is quite big and meaningful for the locals, but could do with more creativity, interaction and engagement",
          "Very interesting from the very beginning. All the artifacts are placed together in one place. This museum gives the true understanding of how the war went. No politics or propaganda, only clear facts and docs. Everyone can make his own conclusions after watching the exhibition.",
          "Even thought the most explications are in belarus, you can see a lot of second war equipments and assembly showing how the partizans fought agains the nazi! Unique!",
          "On of the important war museum in the world focuses on the World War II history from Belarussian perspective. It was opened before the end of the war. There are thousands of thousand of items to see, all is presented with high interest in modern and clean style, with points of",
          "The museum gives a good inside into the second world war. There's lots of tanks, artillery etc. And compared to a lot of western museums you get to see soviet artillery. The museum is built so you don't have to backtrack a lot to see the whole exhibition which I think is",
          "Outstanding modem museum to the great patriotic war 1941-1945 and subsequent conflicts. Modern narrative that\u2019s well balanced by comparison to earlier built museums. Mixture of armaments including many tanks and smaller exhibits.",
          "Can\u2019t say anything bad about the museum itself. It is huge, has a very thorough collection, contains a lot of versatile exhibits. In my opinion though, to make your visit more comprehensive, u gotta make use of an audio guide. In my case the cashier said they were all gone",
          "The outside of the memorial is really special and will give you ample opportunities for great photos. Inside, the exhibits are well cared for if a little difficult to follow for a non-russian speaker. There are some descriptions in English and as to be expected, the theme is",
          "Spent a few hours in here, longer than I normally would in a museum. Its a number of floors, but really well laid out. Very interesting. A lot of life sized military equipment.",
          "Interesting place and a must for photographers especially at night when the monument is illuminated in the three different colors of the national flag.",
          "As title says, a must for history lovers, and of course for them who dont like. :) Location is in middle of one of the main streets in Minsk. Huge collections, a lot of details and informations.",
          "If you really would like to know how much the people of the Soviet Union (including poor people of Belarus that happened to be the first target of the Nazi) suffered through the years of War, this museum is your best option. Great exhibition, rich sources of information, 2 hours",
          "The museum gives very detailed coverage of World War II in Belarus. There is a lot of material on display (how long it takes you to go round the museum depends on how much you want to examine the myriad of objects), including vehicles and planes. There are also several good",
          "The museum has a huge collection and installations. Lots of information, written in English, audioguide available. Really worth to visit.",
          "Extensive museum, takes some time, huge collection of collectibles, as good as the WWII museum in Karlhorst, Berlin",
          "This was a very large museum that you could spend a lot of time at, there is just so much to see! For a small additional charge you can get an audio guide which helps supplement the English signage. Very impressive monument out front as well. Would highly recommend this to",
          "This has been really well designed to show the extent of this horrible war at a personal level. I was truly touched and amazed but the museum - it was not what I was expecting - can thoroughly recommend this.",
          "Don't know how to explain the experience, simply mind boggling. This place you can't miss. There is a big monument outside and few statues as well.The museum is surrounded by Victory Park, which is nice to walk around. The museum has an entry fee of around 3 to 4 dollars. My",
          "A great museum full of informations about what happen in those times, fair ticket even if they charge a little bit more in order to take photos. I know there are museums that charge more and museums that you can take photos for free. you will spent some time if you want to see",
          "Fantastic museum, So much to see. Spent 3 hours in here not enough. We used the english guide & earphones. But would need 6hrs to get round and listen to most information. Its a must see when in minsk",
          "Disclaimer: I speak and read functional Russian This is one of the best curated museums I have ever been to in my life. I do agree with the previous reviewer that it is rather one sided in not providing a very balanced viewpoint of Communism, however it doesn't detract from the",
          "This museum being rated as the number one sight in Minsk is an important reminder of Belarus as a totalitarian state. The former red flag of the Soviet Union is without shame crowning the huge imposing concrete building of the museum, situated just outside Minsk. No need",
          "Don't be put off by the name (or the terrifying museum attendants lurking in every room waiting for you to take illicit pictures) this is a very well laid out museum taking you through the history of Belarus. Not everything is in English but there are hundreds of stories that",
          "Really big and interesting museum. 4 floors filled with all kind of historic items from personal belongings to military wehicles and weapons. Deep and personal fates of the soviet people who fought in the war. Even worth passing by due to the soviet monuments outside and the",
          "This museum is nice and it's worth visiting, but in my opinion there were many things to see but not much information to read. I expected to learn about Belorussian history in details here but there were only basic things mentioned. Anyway, I still recommend that.",
          "Spent well over two hours going around the museum. Could have spent longer if my own time had allowed. All exhibits were described in English.",
          "We spend more than three hours at this very interesting museum. If you have an interest in history, you should go. Most of the texts are translated into English. The museum is very modern and well-illustrated with many very good dioramas. We paid 8 BYR per person and 2 BYR",
          "A beautiful museum, modern, all displays were quite well done and authentic appearing. Admission fee was reasonable. Far a small fee you can take pictures as well. Signage had English portions for the most part so you could tell what you were viewing. I learned allot about the",
          "Went here with my Russian family and greatly enjoyed learning about the great people who fought and died in the war. Learnt a lot about the history of Belarus and Russia including the fact that English engineers helped deign and build the tanks that were used in the wars between",
          "This is a beautiful museum, fairly new, very well laid out and easy to understand in English. Think about it, Belarus was between Germany and Russia during WW2 so they have a lot of history and it is well documented here. Give yourself about 2 hours. There is a small fee but",
          "Fantastic new museum. Lots of English. Clearly labeled and well laid out. You need a couple of hours here.",
          "Modern nd interesting museum.l, i think was best place that i visit in Minsk i could visit alone and i spent a good afternoon is interesting see many documents as original",
          "As in almost every, even the greatest attractions in this country, it is impossible to communicate if you do not speak a Russian language. In the museum there are suitable explanations in English. Still it is an impressive collection of military material in well arranged",
          "For those who was in many other places before, this museum does not offer anything quite new. Hence, average. As a place to get just an impression about the Great War, and how it impacted Belarus - good place. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u0442\u0435\u0445, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0432\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u044f\u0445, \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e",
          "The museum reminded me of the ones in Vietnam, where there is only hurras to Communism and supremacy over the west. Still, it is a very interesting place for those who want to get information about the nazi occupation of Belarus during the URSS era.",
          "The museum tells the World War 2 story from a Soviet perspective. It might be a little biased, which isn't suprising though. It seems well organised and there are loads of things to see and all photos and explanations are also in English! The building is worth a photo from",
          "The museum tells the story about how the Red Army despatched the Nazis from Eastern Europe. There are loads of static displays, guns, murlas, etc, etc. They don't seem to say anything negative about Stalin but that isn't really what the museum is about. Only thing I could say",
          "A good amount of English translation made this an interesting place to visit. I was surprised about how modern and interactive the museum was. There is quite a lot to see particularly if you have an interest in the world wars. The museum has a clear Soviet bias, but that is",
          "Not only is the facade of the building impressive but the collection of exhibits is great too. Fair enough the information is a bit propaganda esc but you would have to be an idiot like some of the other reviewers who went in expecting it to be neutral. It's just interesting",
          "This museum had been started already during WWII and was housed in different places, before it was moved to the actual, big and very modern complex building, where it opened in summer 2014. It is not very centrally located, but for me it was a nice walk from the old town along",
          "I would not say that Minsk is the greatest town but this museum was top notch. Was not intended to go but it was closer than expected to walked over here. Was really pleased I went. Lots of great exhibits of which I believe all were in English. If you are in Minsk this",
          "Great museum! Great exhibits on show! A lot of authetic things. Any visitor should pay special attention to halls dedicated to years of Belarus occupation by fas\u0441ists. Museum is modern, well arranged and definitely worth visiting.",
          "The subject doesn't interest me too much but the museum is very well done and there are english explications everywhere.",
          "One of the best place to visit in the Minsk. English-language tours, which should be booked in advance, will give much-needed context to the collection. ",
          "Get the audio guide!!! You cannot appreciate what this amazing place has to offer without it. Hall after hall of amazing exhibits telling the story of Belarus during the Great War. If you\u2019re in Minsk you have to pay it a visit. Humbling, moving and intensely educational.",
          "It's in a flashy new building that is really well set out. There is a huge amount of stuff in what is not a really large museum and an overseas visitor is not going to look at all the portrait pictures, but the other stuff is very good. If you want see a T34 or a Yak fighter",
          "An impressive building and displays of patriotic memories for the Belarusian people. Definitely a must-see on any trip to Minsk",
          "Very impressive place. If you are just a tiny bit interested in history, don't think twice, go there NOW. The walking path from start to finish makes total sense with descriptions in English all around. You will leave with a much better understanding on not just the war's impact",
          "Really impressed with this museum. Well planned out and very nice displays and lots of artifacts found around the country from war sites. Information signs in Belarusian, Russian and English - so that was great. You have to pay a small fee in rubles to take photos, and",
          "I recommend to take the AudioGuide so that you get all the detail. When you leave this museum you have an excellent understanding on how impacting this war on Belarus, almost 25-30% of the population perished.",
          "In case you are interested in the World War II and war history, this is absolutely a place to visit. Reserve at least two hours to get a basic view. No need to speak just Russian. There is also a nice description in English. Great place to spend afternoon not only in a rainy",

          "I usually don't write museum reviews but this place deserves to be mentioned and visited by all tourists to Minsk. It is a new and clean museum but more importantly, it is very informative and had great exhibits. It really gives a unique perspective on the war that the west",
          "My son is the great admirer of the military history and museum has very good exposition which has some open spaces as well. Check the QR guidance which we did not download at the beginning",

          "We went with reasonable high expectations, as this museum is much praised, quite new and covers an important national topic. We were quite disappointed by the exposition. It's very static, no interaction at all. It includes many set ups of soldiers at war and shows their",

          "I visited this museum, because I was in one in Moscow and it was very insteresting. So I decided to go to this museum and it was really cool. Lot of real vehicles, lot of information in English and lot of weapons and other things. I spent there more than 3 hours. And it only",
          "More than 2,5 million, 30% of the Belarus people, died during the Great Patriotic War 1941 - 1945 (second world war) . The museum, in a very impressive architectural building, gives a thorough account of the terrible history of hardship and the resistance by the Belarus people.",
          "Lots of actually weaponry in close up displays to give you a real feel as well as informational displays, some are interactive. All events and actual description. Unlike most of Europe Belarus has kept it's WWII and Soviet era museums and monuments without muddying,",
          "In Australia we rarely hear about the Soviet side of WW2, so this museum was a terrific learning experience.",
          "A really first class Museum,totally fascinating in all departments far too much to see and experience in a Day.This place is a MUST vist.The people of Belarus suffered deadfully at the Hands of the |German Invaders.It was Hitlers intention of totally exterminating the Belarus",
          "Belarus suffered even worse than neighbouring countries in the Second World War (here, the \"Great Patriotic War\") - the Nazis essentially attempted complete genocide, so here the Jews were in the minority - a total of 2.3 million people were killed, close to the current",
          "The museum itself is pretty standard for a war museum: guns, tanks, uniforms, documents, and other trinkets. But the building itself is fantastic, with great monuments and interesting architectural features. If you've already been to a few war museums, stick to the outside",
          "awesome artefacts awesome museum. awesome war museum not to be missed if in minsk . awesome learning experience",
          "Very interesting and great museum in such a small city (also small country) As understood from the name patriotic it is designed to increase the nationalizm. Some values such as the accuracy range of the 12.7mm MG exaggerated. It is mentioned as 3600m, are you kidding?",
          "walked here from hotel belarus, just a short distance . there is a lovely park to explore if you get there before opening time of 10 am. cost 8 BYR to enter and 1,5 BYR to get permission to take photos. the museum is well organized and a tribute to those who lost their lives",
          "Oh my. Personally, I couldn't stomach the present's gross expropriation of the past and turned away at the door. I did manage to snap a picture of the old Hammer and Sicle flying the Ultra-Stalinist museum building. For the Soviet and/or WWII nostalgic it might be worth the",
          "Comparing to other belarusian museums, this one can surprise you. The exhibition has several rooms, each one is dedicated to a certain GPWar stage. There are many combat vehicles models and other stylized decorations. There is also smth interesting behind the building, take a",

          "This museum can be compared to any famous museum found around the world. The museum is mostly dedicated to the great patriotic war that affected the people of Belarus during the 1940's when they had to fight off the Nazis. The museum is huge and an entrance price is necessary.",
          "Lots of Soviet Union WW II artifacts, which are often hard to find in Western European museums which feature more American and English stuff. Also lots of information about the partisans, which is also less prominent in European WW II museums. Museum is very new inside and",

          "Very nice and modern museum, worth to visit and spend an hour or two. It tells the story of the Great Patriotic War, so only years 1941-1945. 1939 was hardly mentioned, and Soviet agression on Poland just briefly mentioned as Red Army entering \"Western Belarus\". Pity, I hoped",

          "If you want to learn about the history of Belarus in relation to WWII then this is the place. Apart from the well preserved relics, there are entire scenes replicated to show the role of the resistance and how they lived and fought. Definitely a must visit.",
          "We had a good time in museum, very interesting to see and to learn how the lives of ordinary people were changed completely when the war has started. The only downside that the cafe was closed (may be during the winter months!) The weather was so cold that we were dying to sit",

          "If you visit Belorussia you should visit this museum to get a feel of the horrors that the country went through during the Great Patriotic War (known as World War II in other countries). The new museum site has a modern look both outside and inside. I specially appreciated that",

          "Since it was open in 2014 people's interest still burns. Not only foreign visitiors go there - usually ithe museum is full of the locals as well. the system of the rooms is a bit intricate, it's easy to loose the orientation inside. It has problems with English-speaking guides",
          "This is a very and informative museum about the Great Patriotic War. I will recommend this to anyone interested in history.",
          "This was one of the main places that I wanted to see when I planned my trip to Belarus and it definitely lived up to it's expectations. As an American, I always wanted to see the side of World War 2, AKA the great patriotic from the Eastern European side of things. They had",
          "Exterior looks amazing, not sure about interior, cause at that time it was still not open. Loved plane in the back yard.",
          "A really great museum. The layout and displays are immaculate and quite informative, and there were pleanty if them. However a lot if the displays are photos of people who served in the war, and there were lots!",
          "If you visit Belarus, you probably see WW2 memorials everywhere. This is the crown jewel of it all - very informative, lots of things to see. Shows you the horrors of the war, step by step. I think that after a visit to this museum, you really start understand why the",
          "I've never seen a museum like this before, have to say. The complete story about World War II (from Soviet perspective) is told in very atractive way. The history of fight against fascism is very important, and this museum has explain it really good. The park behind museum is",
          "We have visited this museum straight after we arrived in Minsk. It's nice to see all the tanks and artillery as well as all the uniform. Unfortunately it lacks a bit of a storyline.",
          "We have been in this museum 10 years ago, in its original place in Octyabrskaya square. In Aug this year we decided to visit a new place, 20 minutes walk from Nemiga metro station. First impression: information is 'cut and paste' of an old soviet history textbook. A strong",
          "I visited the museum with my grandchildren. The visit was very impressive and cognitive both for me and my grandchildren. We spent several hours in the museum, and it looked short for us. A lot of good installations and armament make the exposition very good.There's also a nice",
          "Really big museum, i was study russian and i had a chance to visit here. This place helps me a lot about history, culture,... of belarus. I took a lot of pictures and really great.",
          "Be aware that the new location of the museum means a 20-25 minute walk from downtown to get there. But it's worth it. The museum is one of the few in Belarus with captions in English. It is detailed and moving without being melodramatic or manipulative. It will also help you to",
          "Themed on the events surrounding the German advance into Belarus in WW2 this museum is more compact and user friendly than the grand but sprawling Moscow twin. For a view of the terrible happenings and sight of the killing machinery used by both sides it is unrivalled. Not for",
          "Nowadays the museum is situated in a new building in Pobediteley prospect. Insode you can see tanks, planes and other military transport. The exhibitions are colorful and atmospheric. There are some useful information about each stand. Also you can find some souvenirs. In this",
          "The new location was a bit inconvenient to get to...however the monument outside was amazing...the displays are in chronological order and with plenty of English explanations...a very thorough display of World War II although from a Belarusian perspective",
          "Must be one of the best museums I have ever been to, friendly staff. Fantastic displays and shows allot of the History of Minsk and during the war. A must see!",
          "This would have to be one of the best museums around. Words in Russian, Belarusian and English. The Belarusians as a people know how to respect their past and never forget. Just like Fortress Brest. Very touching and emotional. Definitely put in on your must see list when",
          "A must do when in Minsk. To learn about the recent history of Minsk both during war and post war era was highly interesting. The new exhibiton hall is cleverly planned and displays both vehicles, weapons, re-do's of war scenes, short films and a lot of documents and other war",
          "This modern museum documents the terrible Belorussian experience of World War II. Prewar events are also documented. Life size figures and military equipment portray battle scenes and wartime living conditions. The horrors of the war are clearly evident but not so graphically",
          "Almost everything about this museum is superb. Museum moved here in 2014 and new building is amazing. Top floor the victory hall is awe inspiring. There are 9 different halls of exhibits. All very well done. Info in English so don't really need a guide. Only slight minus point",
          "The museum has recently moved to sparkling new premises, the ones I visited. It told of a world full of heroes and fascists, with nothing in between, completely glossing over the Red Army invasion of Poland and the Baltic States or of how the Stalin purges so dramatically",
          "I am an amateur military historian and really enjoyed visiting this excellent war museum. It is large and has so much interesting material about World War II. There is a lot of equipment and displays to view. It offers interesting insight into the struggles against Nazi",
          "First, the architecture of the museum is wonderful. You can tell it was also very well designed and planned for the exhibits it has. It has quite a good sized collection of artifacts from the war. You get to learn some history about it from the perspective of the Belarusian",
          "interesting museum, unusual compositions, very impressive, useful to go there with children, a good idea for a family event",
          "Worth visiting if you like history. Esp the history of the Second World War. The installations have English texts. Great museum!",
          "The state museum describes the mainly the conditions during and after annexation by Germany. It has some collections of weapons and machinery and quite a lot of photos and personal items from Belarusian freedom fighters. A very well presented Musem",
          "Looks like WWII is a great deal around here. Exposition is really good, Modern design and interactive panels makes it very interesting.",
          "The new museum is nicely done. Plenty of artifacts from WW2 and a lot of information displayed next to almost all items. Probably impossible to read everything in one day. What impressed me most was how nicely and detailed everything is arranged in there. I hoped to find a",
          "Very good museum with many artifacts from WWII. Very modern and neat. There is also english writing on most of the exhibits for non belarussian speakers.",
          "Good guided tour. The museum is quite big, very well designed and organised. There are many relevant artefacts in exhibition. Perhaps a little bit \"politicised\", but that's normal for this kind of museums and completely understandable. If you are not from an Eastern European",
          "Though the people don't seem very friendly, you just need to get to know them. The Museum itself was great to see and an eye opener. Kids loved it. Would recommend the staff smile more and appear welcoming.",
          "It is a side of the war I never saw. A real eye opener. You can see how little the troops even had to eat",
          "The museum building is new - it was built instead of the old one that is already destroyed. But there is no place for sorrow - the new building and exposition is far better than the old one. Every exibit is described in Russian, Belorussian and English. There are lots of",
          "The building is just as attractive inside as it is outside. Outstanding exhibits and memorial to the Belarusian citizens. It takes you through the time before, during the siege by the Nazis to the retaking of the city of Minsk and its surrounding area by the Russians. It is a",
          "This museum is of a very high standard and I think it would appeal to people of all ages and all levels of knowledge. It could have been awfully depressing but actually it was just very moving and very informative. There was a shortage of English guidebooks which was a pity",
          "The museum is in an impressive new building in Victory Park. The architecture and surrounding park are also worth the visit. The collections inside are very moving and incredibly tragic - it provides a moving but heart-wrenching picture of the devastation that Belarus suffered",
          "A huge building and its architecture is attractive. The lightenings are perfect. You must see that building both at day time and at nights. In front of that attractive building, there is a very very big square. This helps Belarusian State Museum building seen bigger and huge..",
          "This museum is an impressive modern building but that does not detract from the story it tells of the suffering endured during the war. We in the west have very little idea of the devastation, destruction and slaughter which took place in this region and you have to see this to",
          "The museum building and the surrounding victory park is worth a visit in itself, the collection in the museum is impressive and very sad and moving. Personally I was most moved by the pictures of ordinary citizens and events from the war, presented in one of the last halls of",
          "This is a must see to learn how the Great Patriotic War or World War II as the West calls it, has shaped the Belarusian soul. Great dioramas and set ups. The top tier feels like a spiritual building; the Belarusian state as a religion!",
          "Interesting museum containing many artefacts from WWII contained in an impressive building. Not much in the way of a storyline holding the exhibitions together, but enough to indulge your interest.",
          "The best museum in Minsk with some amazing exhibitions and military vehicles including tanks and my favourite, the 'Katusha' or 'Stalin's Organ' as well as English language signs. You can easily spend 2-3 hrs here so definitely worth a visit",
          "The best museum in Minsk without a doubt. English language signs accompany all of the displays, so you won't be lost. Definitely visit this place.",
          "This was easily the best thing we did in Minsk. The museum has moved (the geo tag is correct) from where it is in most travel guides. Everything is translated into English which we found surprising considering we struggled so much in this city not speaking Belarusian/Russian.",
          "I visited this museum not once when it was situated in its old building. The new one is more impressive! If you want to know more about the Great Patriotic War, go there! You will understand why Belarusians still keep the memory of it in their hearts.",
          "This is absolutely a must see place. Great museum, one of the best war museums I've ever seen. You might be shocked with what Nazi have done on this land. Highly recommended.",
          "We found the museum quite interesting. We did visit the museum the day after we had a guided tour of Minsk - so perhaps we were prepared for some of the history in advance of the museum. The museum did an effective job of communicating its message about the Great Patriotic War",
          "Although there are English explanations in most area's, you will only get the summary rather than any detail information as it's only in Russian and Belaruse. The displays do not flow well either, so its difficult to understand the time-line. The exhibits themselves are good and",
          "The Great Patriotic War is the most important part of Belorussian history and had a very big impact on formation of nation. It has very good modern exhibitions on the war and gives the full understanding and picture of that historical time. If you like go to the museums, this",
          "They have a fair amount of descriptions in English. Price is very cheap. I thoroughly enjoyed this museum. A must see if you are a military or history buff. Right on a major bus line.",
          "Large exhibition full of artefacts and well laid out chronologically but interest thinly spread imho. Cafe and small shop inside entrance",
          "Sadly, when I visited this museum with my friend, who is a native Belarussian, the museum was close to closing. It did not stop me having a look at every room in the place and photographing many of the items on display. I would suggest that for anyone with an interest in the",
          "Truly a large museum telling the story of Belarus in the second world war - Nazi invasion and occupation and then back to soviet regime. There are several levels with photos, dioramas, videos, tanks, smaller weapons and so on. Going through every detail would take a whole day.",
          "My friend and I thought this museum was excellent, although inside it turned out to be much larger than we'd thought from outside,and we didn't really have enough time or energy to properly look at the last half, as we went somewhat late in the day. A lot of the exhibits have",
          "since childhood I liked the books and movies about WWII and always I try to visit museums and monuments to remember my grandpa. he was a soldier in WWII and he told me so much about it ;-(((",
          "This museum is housed in a grand new building (opened 2014 I believe). It was quite busy when I visited on a Saturday afternoon. Much of the display is typical of war museums with uniforms and equipment. There are some graphic photos from the concentration camp near Minsk, that",
          "I liked it very much Very nice design with a lot of space and comprehensive description of everything. You can see a lot of movies describing this period with some touch screens everywhere for help I recommend it",
          "Unfortunately I did not have enough time to visit all the exhibits but what I did see was very interesting most exhibits had an English translation so it is possible to understand most of the exhibits. Would love to go back there again to take in more of the atmosphere. I went",
          "I was at the old museum several times, and it was getting run down towards the end. The new building is much grander and for the first time, exhibit cards do have English to read. Well worth the trip.",
          "Not enough in English but a good museum to tour for 1-2 hours. You certainly get the Soviet version of how bad the Nazi's were!",
          "I was first misguided by the location of the old venue still marked on the Tripadvisor map. It took me a while until I succeeded to find the new location, and was impressed by the sculpture and design of its gate and exterior. The place is new, modern and organized and the",
          "It's a new museum. Exposition is very interesting, with beautiful and realistic historic installations! Must see.",
          "The Museum is very modern with a lot of interesting things. The first Museum of the Great Patriotic War where there was a line at the entrance for the tickets and very-very crowded inside. Good both for children and adults. PLan at least one hour for it.",
          "Recently reopened in a modern purpose built building with more space for exhibits, including examples of military aircraft, armoured vehicles, weapons, uniforms, reconstructions, lots of documents, photographs, newsfilm etc. Alot of information about the partisan movement. The",
          "This museum is dedicated to the Belarus partisans who resisted the Nazis. If you are a fan of WWII history, this is an aspect that has been neglected in the Western world. This museums tells about the tremendous struggle and contribution of the people of Belarus during the war.",
          "A very excellent way to document and tell the story of a nation. I became very informed of the history of Belarus but equally moved in the way it is told. I would highly recommend this.",
          "When it reopens it should be fantastic!. The current building resembles a disused office block in Basildon.",
          "This is a museum that should be seen. It shows how terrible it was for countries who were invaded by the Germans and had them on their soil. Most affecting are the photos, clearly taken by the Germans, of partisana and Jews being murdered by smiling Germans. The terror that the",
          "We were excited to go to this museum and then we realised the guide only spoke in Russian! We had no idea what she was going on about and no one translated for us. This meant we were bored and just looking at everything trying to work out what was going on. The displays were",
          "Really full of information and great displays. I don't speak a word of Russian, but the visit was worth it anyway. You get the picture and it is worth honouring the sacrifice these people went through. Touching.",
          "But not only weapons from the war. A lot of pictures and documents from the german ockupation, resistance movement and destruction. Many pictures are unpleasant to look at but they give a good view of the horror during the war. There is also a very small souvenir kiosk managed",
          "This is a good museum to pop into and get a sense for how the Belarusians perceived WW2. The displays are not written in English, but there is a helpful website (www.warmuseum.by) to describe it. In particular, I thought they had a nice collection of guns and memorabilia even"

At the beginning of its activity the Academy had only 128 staff members, among them 87 scientists. By 1941 the Academy had 750 staff and 12 subdivisions.\nDuring World War II the Academy was evacuated to Russia and other Soviet republics. Huge damage was brought to the Academy's material state.\nRight after war's end, eight institutes started their activity again. By 1951 the Academy had 29 subdivisions, 1234 staff including 33 academicians. The Academy was supported by the governments of Belarus and the USSR as well as by leading scientific centres in Moscow, Leningrad and other Soviet cities.\nThrough its history the National Science Academy of Belarus has grown up to a respectful scientific center.

Local people call it the \"Opierny Teatr\" (Belarusian) or the \"Opera and Ballet Theatre\". It opened on 15 May 1933 but it first did not have its own venue for presentations at the Belarusian Drama Theatre building until 1938.\nThe first permanent theatre was founded in Belarus in 1933 on the basis of the Belarusian opera and ballet school, the organizer of the studio being the famous Russian Opera singer Anton Bonachich (Bonatschitsch) (ru: \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0411\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0447). He was the first head of the new theatre. But he stayed in this position for a very short time,  dying in 1933.\nThe current theatre building was opened in 1939. It was designed by the Belarus architect from Leningrad,  Iosif Langbard, whose original design was only partially implemented and some design details were omitted yielding to financial and other problems; the theatre has reliefs done by Zair Azgur.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first permanent theatre was founded in Belarus in 1933 on the basis of the Belarusian opera and ballet school, organizer of the Studio being the famous Russian Opera singer Anton Bonachich (Bonatschitsch) (ru: \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0411\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0447). He was the first head of the new theatre, but he stayed in this position for a very short time and died in 1933.\nBizet's Carmen opened the theatre on 25 May 1933 with the title role being sung by Larisa Aleksandrovskaya. Several professional soloists and dancers were added to the troupe in the first few years at this location. Swan Lake, performed by K. Muller, was the first show on the stage of the new theatre. By 1940, Grand was added to the theatre's name to indicate its expansion. The performances by the theatre company during the \"Decade of Belarusian Art\" in Moscow in June 1940 was a great success which included the first Belarusian ballet, The Nightingale composed by Mikhail Kroshner, as well as other national operas such as \"In the Dense Forest of Palesse\", \"The Flower of Fortune\", and the second version of \"Mikhas Padgorny\". Performances continued during the war in Nizhny Novgorod, then known as Gorky until the liberation of Minsk in 1944; after that performances took place in Kovrov.\nEnrichment of post World War 2 repertoire and expansion\nDuring this time the repertoire was greatly enriched. The most famous operas staged in this theatre include Boris Godunov by Modest Mussorgsky, Otello and Don Carlo by Giuseppe Verdi, Jacques Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann, Sadko and The Golden Cockerel by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and Lohengrin by Richard Wagner. Socialist realist operas by Belarusian composers such as Yuri Semenyako, Yevgeny Glebov (Your Spring, 1963) and Heinrich Wagner were included.\n\nAmong the most notable composers has been Kulikovich Shcheglov, who like some of the writers went into exile after the war. Others include Yevgeny Glebov, composer of the opera Your Spring (1963) and the ballet Alpine Ballad (1967), ...\" In 1967, the theatre was awarded the title of Academic for its status in the progression of the performing arts.In 1996 the State Theater was divided into two independent theatres: the National Academic Grand Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus and the National Academic Opera Theatre of Belarus, but in 2008 they once again combined to become the present name, National Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus.\nThe building was renovated and it reopened in 2009. Many sculptures were added around the theatre, its stage was slightly moved and audience space expanded. The most up-to-date lighting and motion equipment was added while adhering to the original design. The ballet company is considered one of the foremost companies in the world.\n\n\n== The theatre today ==\nWorks by Belarus composers in the company's repertoire today include Dmitry Smolsky's The Grey Legend (Russian \u00ab\u0421\u0435\u0434\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u00bb 1978).The company tours a lot and it is welcomed in many countries all over the world. In Spain, Russia, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Israel, Portugal, China admirers of opera are well acquainted with the repertoire of this Belarusian theatre. Its participation in the well-known annual German festival known as  \"Classic Open Air\" has already become a tradition.\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\n\n== External links ==\nNational Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus Official website (in English) Media related to Opera and Ballet Theatre of Belarus at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Minsk (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a [m\u02b2insk], Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) is the capital and largest city of Belarus, located on the Svisla\u010d and the Nyamiha Rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom. A good example is St. Elisabeth's Convent, founded in 1999.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nKalvaryja (Calvary Cemetery) is the oldest surviving cemetery in the city. Many famous people of Belarus are buried here. The cemetery was closed to new burials in the 1960s.\nMilitary Cemetery\nEastern Cemetery\n\u010cy\u017eo\u016dskija Cemetery\nNorthern Cemetery\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nMajor theatres are:\n\nNational Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus \nBelarusian State Musical Theatre (performances in Russian)\nMaxim Gorky National Drama Theatre (performances in Russian)\nYanka Kupala National Drama Theatre (performances in Belarusian)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nMajor museums include:\n\nBelarusian National Arts Museum\nBelarusian Great Patriotic War Museum\nBelarusian National History and Culture Museum\nBelarusian Nature and Environment Museum\nMaksim Bahdanovi\u010d Literary Museum\nOld Belarusian History Museum\nYanka Kupala Literary MuseumArt galleries include:\n\n\u040e gallery\n\n\n=== Recreation areas ===\nChelyuskinites Park\nChildren's Railroad\nGorky Park (Minsk)\nYanka Kupala Park\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are more than 400 travel agencies in Minsk, about a quarter of them provide agent activity, and most of them are tour operators.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\nFC Dinamo Minsk\nFC Minsk\nFC Torpedo Minsk\nFC Energetik-BGU Minsk\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nHC Dinamo Minsk\nHC Yunost Minsk\n\n\n=== Handball ===\nSKA Minsk\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nBC Tsmoki-Minsk\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\nIn 2013, Minsk hosted the European Junior Rowing Championships at the Republican Center of Olympic Training for Rowing And Canoeing to the north-west of the city.Minsk hosted the 2014 IIHF World Championship at the Minsk Arena.\nIn January 2016, the 2016 European Speed Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena. Minsk Arena is the only indoor speed skating rink in Belarus.\nOn 21 October 2016, it was confirmed by the European Olympic Committee that Minsk will host the 2019 European Games.\nThe 2019 European Figure Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena from the 21st to 27 January.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nMinsk has an extensive public transport system. Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks.

Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries.

          "The Upper town which is in fact the old town of Minsk is a pretty small area. It's on an elevated small hill where this reconstructed classic Town hall stands. Just few met away are the Orthodox Holy Spirit Church, as well the Catholic one with souvenir stands, bars and",
          "A symbol of the city. Central and not super big, in the heart of the city stand the City Hall. Surrounded by main churches of Minsk, pay a visit to it!",
          "This is a very important building in Minsk, and worth seeing for yourself. It has historical significance.",
          "This is a reconstruction of the original town hall. Worth having a look at if you're passing, not really worth going out of your way for. Part of Minsk \"Upper City\"/\"Old Town\". Minsk is quite a flat city, it's not like it's a huge climb! Come out of Niamiha metro station and",
          "This is a nice enough reconstruction of the original town hall. It is set together with a few other similar looking buildings to form a reconstructed old town area, on a small hill overlooking the river. Might be worth a quick look.",
          "If you are passing by, you can take some pictures, but it is not a special building; rather plain, on my opinion.",
          "Easily seen as you walk into the historic city center along Lenina Street, this gleaming white building with a green roof was built in the Neoclassical style, and features four Ionic columns and a clock tower topped with a weather vane. The original town hall was blown up in",
          "the city hall is located right in the centre in the old part of the city, well renovated but quite small from outside",
          "A symbol of the municipal government with a classical appearance. The City Hall is located near Trinity Hill, is a good area to stroll around and admired the surroundings",
          "City hall is in middle of other tourist attractions, like Holy Spirit Cathedral etc. I didn't go inside the building. But its worth stopping by when you are in this area. Building itself has nice architecture. There are quite a few good restaurants, bars around this area.",
          "I had a chance to visit the Minsk City Hall, but the exterior only. I would recommend this as a quick stop. The building is in what is considered the historic part of Minsk. It will give you a sense of architecture, and it's interesting to see how the old streets were laid out",
          "Minsk is a very clean and tidy city with many parks, the tourist area is quite small so easy to walk around, the city hall is in the centre close to the river. It is located in a small square with lots of small caf\u00e9's to relax and enjoy the views",
          "From one hand the residents are proud of the City Hall - the building was constructed at the same place in the XVII-th century. But it couldn't bare hard periods and was completely ruined. So the construction we can see is quite modern, thuogh the architects used the old schemes",
          "This is actually the heart of the Old Town. Ancient buildings were reconstructed recently, and they probably lack the authenticity and special vibe, but still this place is a remarkable one for Minsk residents. The City Hall and the main Orthodox Church are situated here. Cafes",
          "As Minsk lacks a typical old town, this is the default town center...some great restaurants nearby and some good architecture including the city hall itself to check out",
          "Wandering up this road, one can't help but enjoy the range of interesting buildings and be tempted to capture their images with your camera. Information signs help you to identify what they are and it is a joy to just stroll along and see the different architecture unfurl.",
          "Minsk Town Hall or Minsk City Hall as it is also known is located in the centre of the city in Liberty Square. The building was first built in 1583 but has since been rebuilt many times in different forms but was last destroyed in 1857 and the rebuilding process began in 1980",
          "Lovely white facade but basically it's an office building. Makes for some fine photo opportunities with the surrounding square. We did not go inside",
          "My favorite place in Minsk is Liberty Square. Each European city has a market square with the City Hall. Minsk is not an exception. The amazing snow-white building of a the City Hall decorates one of the most beautiful squares of Minsk \u2014 Liberty Square. Since the 16th",
          "Amazing visit. The architecture and beauty is one to marvel at. Wonderful experience and thoroughly enjoyable",
          "In the middle of a beautiful square this is an impressive building with some great photo opportunities as well. Close to historical buildings and beautiful churches.",
          "I took a photo of this building because it's quite pretty, and then later realised it's the city hall. Located in a really nice part of the city near the main square and next to a smaller square and park. There's some pretty curches nearby and the surrounding streets are largely",
          "I tried to visit ... but the sign with the prices was only in Cyrillic ... And I suspect the guy was saying that the woman cashier was on a break ... From what I could see from the entrance lobby, it looked like it could be interesting !",
          "It is beautifull and outstanding of the time even that was built many years ago. Located in the center of the city and it's historical part so famous among tourists."

          "The Holy Spirit Cathedral is the main Orthodox Church in Minsk, set in the center of the Upper town (old town). It dates back to 17c, and survived fires, WWII demolishing and Stalin's dictatorship. The renovated exterior is pretty simple, rather a whitewashed twin belfries",

          "This is not an old cathedral, but it is very well attended. It's light, airy, and pleasant. The most interesting aspect is the many worshipers who come to pray, with a depth not seen as much in western churches today. The cathedral is sited on top of a hill with a good view of",

          "Compared with some orthodox churches - this is relatively plain. Whilst there are plenty of holy pictures - the walls aren't painted like some of the best ones. It's quite a bright church - and is clearly used by the locals.",

          "Located next to the Old Town Hall building in a charming square full of restaurants and bars. This is an Orthodox church, the predominant religion in Minks. It is worth knowing if you are passing through town."

The square is located in the historic centre of Minsk nearby with the museum of the 1st Congress of RSDLP, Main offices of National State TV and Radio and City House of Marriages. A green park stretches from the Victory Square to the river of Svislach and to the entrance to the M. Gorky Park. Victory Square is the key landmark of Minsk. Holiday parades go through the square. The newly married traditionally take their picture at the square. Victory Square is a key landmark for Belarus like Red Square in Moscow for the Russian Federation.\nTransportation: Metro \"Plo\u0161\u010da Pieramohi\", street car 1,3,4,6,8,10,11\n\n\n== Victory Monument ==\n\nA 3-meter replica of the Order of Victory crowns a granite column of 38 metre erected in the centre of the square. The Sacred Sword of Victory is at the base of the monument. The monument was built in 1954 in honour of the soldiers of the Soviet Army and partisans of Belarus. Sculptors: Z. Azgur, A. Bembel, S. Selikhanau. Architects: U. Karol, G. Zagorski.\nThe four facets of the pedestal hold bronze relief thematic images: \"May 9, 1945\", \"Soviet Army during the Great Patriotic War\", \"Belarusian Partisans\", \"Honour to Heroes who gave their lives for liberation\".\nThe four bronze wreaths around the obelisk signify the four Fronts. The soldiers of these fronts gave their lives fighting to liberate Belarus from German Fascist invaders.\n\n\n=== Post #1 ===\n\nPost #1 at Victory Square refers to guard duty that is carried out by members of the armed forces and among students of general education schools and vocational schools in Minsk. Post #1 was initiated on 3 July 1984, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the liberation of Minsk. The guard of honor serves at Post No. 1 for one week from 9.00 to 17.00 in the cold and from 9.00 to 18.00 in the warm time of the day. The duration of each shift is 10 to 20 minutes.  The only breaks in maintaining the honorary were from 15 May to 1 November 1988, from 1 June to 20 November 2003, and from 1 December 2003 to 20 April 2004.\n\n\n== History of Construction ==\n\nPrior to 1958 the square held a name \"Kruglaya\" (Round). Builders led by architect R. Stoler started constructing two round buildings around the square. During the Great Patriotic War the buildings were partially destroyed. R. Stoler returned to Minsk in 1957 to help rebuild these buildings. Before the Great Patriotic War a street car was running on Sovetskaya street through the square. Before the construction of the Victory Monument there was a memorial stone fenced with a chain.\n\nIn 1946 the BSSR government opened a competition for design of a Victory Memorial. Initially the site was planned in the vicinity of the current \"Kastrychnitskaya\" (October) square. Selected design provided for a 48-metre monument made of white pink marble. To open the memorial by the 10th anniversary of liberation of Belarus, the design was adjusted to use gray granite and make the column 10 metres shorter. Ukrainian quarries near Dnepropetrovsk and Zhytomyr provided the granite for construction. Leningrad Academy of Arts crafted the mosaic for the Order of Victory. Ukrainian carvers indented the granite reliefs. Leningrad factory \"Monumentskulptura\" cast bronze reliefs, sward and wreaths. On 3 July 1961, on the 17th anniversary of liberation of Minsk, Honourable Citizen of Minsk, Hero of Soviet Union colonel-general Alexei Burdeinei lit the eternal flame at the foundation of the obelisk. In 1984 architects B. Larchenko, B. Shkolnikov, K.Vyazgin re-designed the square from round into oval to fit the exits from metro station. On 1 July 1984 granite blocks were mounted with capsules containing soil from Soviet Hero Cities: Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol, Kerch, Novorossiysk, Tula, Brest Fortress. In 1985 capsules with soil from Hero Cities Smolensk and Murmansk were added.\n\n8 May 1985 in commemoration of 40th anniversary of Victory in Great Patriotic War a Memorial Hall opened in the pedestrian underpass under the Victory Square. The Hall honours the Heroes of Soviet Union who gave their lives to liberate Belarus from Nazi occupation. A circular gallery under the square connects the underpass with the Memorial Hall. Artist V. Pozhyak crafted a highlighted glass wreath in the center of the Hall. A bronze star of Hero of Soviet Union is embedded in the hall's wall. 566 names of natives from Belarus and other Soviet republics are listed on the wall. Those are the people who fought to liberate Belarusian soil and were awarded the title of Hero of Soviet Union for their heroic deeds. \n\nIn 2003 the square was slightly updated to improve the monument stability due to damage from metro trains running under it, as well as to replace the grown-up firs with grass lawns.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Pieramohi Square, Minsk at Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe original 50th look of the square\nMinsk Victory Square at official site of the Republic of Belarus\nKey landmarks in Minsk\n\n\n== References ==",

As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom.

Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, Smolensk, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nAccording to the survey in 2019 (were interviewed 1934 people), in Minsk around 811 thousand of adult bicycles plus 232 thousand of child and adolescent bicycles. In Minsk one bike is for 1.9 people. The total number of bicycles in Minsk exceeds the total number of Cars (770 thousand of personal automobiles). 39% of Minsk residents have a personal bike. 43% of Minsk residents ride a bicycle once a month or more. As of 2017, the level of bicycle use is about 1% of all transport movements (for comparison: 12% in Berlin, 50% in Copenhagen).\n\nSince 2015, a bicycle parade / bicycle carnival held in Minsk, during which vehicles are blocked for several hours along Pobediteley (Peramohi) Avenue (one of the main streets of Minsk). The number of participants in 2019 was more than 20 thousand, the number of registrations was about 12 thousand.In 2017, the European Union funded the project \"Urban cycling in Belarus\" in the amount of 560 thousand euros, within the framework of which the public association Minsk Cycling Society together with the Council of Ministers created the regulatory document National Concept for the Development of Cycling in Belarus.\n\nSince 2013, a free public workshop \"Bicycle Kitchen Garage 38\" has been operating in Minsk, where everyone can use the tool and help repairing the bicycle. Free bike school works.In 2020, Minsk entered the top 3 most cycling cities in the CIS \u2013 after Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nMinsk National Airport is located 42 km (26 mi) to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current railway station opened in 1987. It is an international airport with flights to Europe and the Middle East.Minsk-1 opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1 million passengers a year.From 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, Kiev and Kaliningrad. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as Minsk-City.Minsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is located in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges, and 29 higher education institutions, including 12 major national universities.\n\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\nAcademy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

The library is located in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. It houses the largest collection of Belarusian printed materials and the third largest collection of books in Russian behind the Russian State Library (Moscow) and the Russian National Library (Saint Petersburg).\n\n\n== Building ==\nConstruction of the new building started in November 2002 and completed in January 2006. The library's main architectural component has the shape of a rhombicuboctahedron. The height of the building is 73.6 metres (241.5 feet) and weight is 115 000 tonnes (not including books). The building has 23 floors. The National Library can seat about 2,000 readers and features a 500-seat conference hall. The library's new building was designed by architects Mihail Vinogradov and Viktor Kramarenko and opened on 16 June 2006.The National Library of Belarus is the main information and cultural centre of the country. Its depository collections include about 10 million items of various media. In 1993 the National Library of Belarus started to create its own electronic information resources. It has generated a collection of bibliographic, factual graphic, full-text, graphic, sound and language databases that comprise more than 2 million records. The scope of databases is quite wide: humanities, social sciences, history, art and culture of Belarus. Library users also have access to databases of other libraries and academic institutions, including foreign ones.\nThe library service is in great demand. More than 90 thousand citizens of Belarus are library users, who annually request 3.5 million documents. Every day the library is visited by more than 2,200 people. The library delivers about 12,000 documents daily.\nIn addition to serving as a functional library, the National Library is a city attraction. It is situated in a park on a river bank and has an observation deck looking over Minsk. As of 2009, it is the only structure in Minsk with a public observation deck. The area in front of the library is used for many public concerts and shows.\n\n\n== Observation deck ==\nA special elevator for tourists leading is located on the backside of the building. The library's roof is located on the twenty third floor. The roof has an observation deck equipped with binoculars arranged over the perimeter. Also, there is a cafe and a gallery on the twenty second floor.\n\n\n== Interesting facts ==\nSaddam Hussein donated half a million dollars for the construction of the library.\nThe building is also the subject of an art video by French artist Raphael Zarka, \"Rhombus Sectus\", shown at the Bischoff/Weiss gallery, London, in 2011.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNational Library of Belarus (in Russian, Belarusian, and English)\nEmporis Web site\nOfficial photo gallery\nCreative studio of the architect Victor Kramarenko\nCreative studio of the architect Mihail Vinogradov\nBischoff/Weiss gallery",

          "Is a large futuristic building, it looks like a giant diamond balancing on a mirror. The unique design of this building alone makes the National Library of Belarus an absolute attraction. There is not much to observe around because it is just outside the center",

          "What a great place! Voted the 27th most unusual building in the world. Best to visit in the morning to avoid queues. Not the best restaurant at the top but the views are good and the telescope is free! It would be better if you could book tickets online - not sure why they don\u2019t",
          "The Library is definetly an unusual building and it may deserve a visit on any trip to Minsk. Even at night it has quite a colourful and varying illumination, when the commercials are not dominating it. Sadly that's all what one can do there. Going to the top is not worth even",

          "If you ever visit Belarus, you must not go home without visiting this amazing sight, especially in the evening time when all the lights on the outside of the building come on. It is one of the most amazing sights I have ever seen and i will never forget this. I also ventured up",

          "I saw this structure on the main road coming in from the airport. It certainly stands out. I returned to visit it in order to take a short excursion by metro out of the center of Minsk. The subway ride is definitely worth the 30 kopecks. Five minutes walk from the nearest metro",
          "I've heard that it's some chance to get into the library. The offer that I actually received getting there is to eat at the nice post-soviet cafe and look down on the city from the top floor. I'm not sure that anyone would go there for this amount of attractions.",
          "The building itself is interesting only from the outside. But it has also a viewpoint on top, where you can admire the scenery around, which is really nice during the summer. You need to buy a ticket and to take an elevator to reach it. There is a cafe also under the viewpoint.",

          "You need to circle around out back to access the observation tower which costs 3 BYR. This is pretty much the only option in Minsk when it comes to observation towers but it affords a good view of the area. At night the Library itself lights up which is neat.",
          "The National Library is a very interesting place. Besides being the country's main library, it's a huge multipurpose center (for political, cultural and educational events, both national and international). It combines high technologies, modern design and peculiar architecture.",

          "The Observation Deck offers great views of the city, but the Plexiglass prevents you from getting quality photos. The Cafe downstairs offers a range of drinks at affordable prices, and be sure to exit after dark to see the light show display all around the building. The downside",
          "The area and the library itself are very nice, but but they are away from the city center. It's convinient to see it on the way to/from Minsk National Airport. A lot of people adore the view from the observation plarform at the top of the building, but from my point of view it's",

          "National Library of Belarus is famous for its unusual design. It is possible to get on the top of it, there is a viewing platform there. Ticket costs 3 BYN, credit cards are accepted. From the top you see nothing, just construction sites nearby, and some nature. Only one",
          "Well, \"the Diamond\" (as it's called by locals) is nice to see, and you can also visit panoramic gallery at the top. But it's located rather far from center, so if you have not much time - choose something else and look at the photos instead :)",
          "Very nice place with roof that can show nice view .. it's consider as one of the largest library in Europe..",
          "But if You are with the bigger group and want to visit the tower...think twice. Ticket line will be very long and it takes lot of time. I did not have patience to wait :)",

          "Really bad observation terace. No good view, and covered with dirty windows. Also not that high to call a tower! But you can ride Segway just in front of it and its more fun.",
          "This building is worth a visit just for its architectural quirkiness alone, but it also offers possibly the only public observation deck in Minsk. The library is a little way out of the city centre (take the Metro to Uschod station - the library is an easy two-minute walk from",
          "The diamond shape building is a pride of Belarus. If is a functioning state library. We were there for work purposes, and we had an organized tour of the library. Nothing special to me. Then we were taken on a lift to the roof top, where ther is a restaurant and the panorama of",

          "I normally don't visit libraries when traveling. But the architecture and design of this building is very unique and well worth a visit.",
          "An amazing and very modern building and the area and park around the library is a nice place to walk.",
          "Do like reading books?))) even if you don't- you need to come there. Coz here is a viewing point on the top of the building on the 23 floor (I m not mistaken). The entrance fee is 30 000 Belarus rubles per person. To get to the top - you can use a lift with glass wall and",
          "The 1-day ticket for tourist is very cheep, about the same as metro ticket. You can visit only floors 1-3. In the 3rd floor was a little museum with old books etc. This room is the primary goal for tourists in this house. The building is quite modern, but women`s toilets",
          "A nice building, worth visiting when in Minsk. A few metro stations away from the center. There used to be a lovely green area around but now there are some building sites in the area. Still good to visit.",
          "I visited the library because I needed to print 1 document. It took around 1 hour as I had to make a library card, go to 3 different cashiers, put the personal staff in a locker and ask around to find the right department with a printer. It was an experience as such but it also",
          "Although it doesn't look like a library from far it is one. It features an observation deck. From a distance it looks cool and glassy but when getting closer concrete starts to be visible behind the glass taking away something westernish from the initial thoughts. A backup plan",
          "Although the initial view is not that of a Library, it is a must see for anyone in Minsk. Photo attached is a view from the observation deck on Top. Well worth the visit",
          "This place is used for conference and cultural events too. The restaurants and cafes in the Library could be more attractive for visitors. The viewing platform costs much less than its analogues in Europe though it is worth its cost. The disadvantage of the viewing platform is",
          "one of the most interesting building across the world.it took 7 (if i am not wrong) years to complete the construction. as a nature huge amount of books and a great view of Minsk while you can drink your coffee...",
          "I didnt like it. I prefer classic buildings more, not these glassed modern ones. Especially when it is a National library. Also, the advertisement with phone numbers at night is not that good idea.. And what concerns the top of the roof with the viewing platform, it is not the",
          "Frankly speaking, advertisement is far from reality. Do not expect too much from this building, the lightning they are talking about all over is far not so bright and beautiful. The buiding is not so big as you could imagine, may be for Belarus it is an art-object but in reality",
          "I finally got to see the National Library of Belarus on my recent trip. I didn't get to see it during the day, but it was beautiful at night. It's nice to have something this unique in the city, it's not a Vegas experience, but it is fun nonetheless. The building is covered in",
          "Worth special visit - especially for the viewing platform at the top of the building. The surrounding territory is also transformed into beautiful park. I recommend to go there since may till october. The \"Vostok\" metro station is within 3 minutes by foot from there.",
          "Beautiful both outside and inside. A great place to study and enjoy nice view from the top of the building. Take a moment and visit it in the evening as it shines with millions of lights in different regimes. And of course, read a book!",
          "If you are in Minsk please visit the library, fantastic building 24 floors high and you can go out onto the roof, the views of the city are impressive in spite of all the construction work taking place, when this area is finished it really will be something to see. The building,",
          "Very modern looking building. Inside the building it is very nice. You can easily begin to read in this libraray. Nice environment. You can see city view on the top of this building. It looks like a diamond in night times.",
          "A visit to the National Library was recommended to us by at least 3 Minsk natives. It truly is their national pride. There's a charge for the elevators to the viewing deck on top of the library. The views of Minsk were very good, though there were coin operated binoculars that",
          "The national library of Belarus is a amazing piece of soviet like modern architecture. On the roof you have the panorama view platform with a fantastic view over central Minsk. Just take the metro to Uschod station and walk 100 m to the library. The entrance to the platform is",
          "I went to National Library Musueum having subway.It is l\u0131ttle bit far from center of city but going there is so easy. Tower is a scenic place.Book museum is recommended.",
          "Library of Belarus is indeed mysterious and worthy to be visited(though I can't compare with others), at night it is especially beautiful. Here to store the smallest and the largest books of our country. In the library over 9 million books, also has books in electronic form. In",
          "At the edge of a park you can find this \"pearl\". For some reason a few people like it and even feel proud of it. If you have a minimum of architectural interest you won't hurt yourself by going here unless you want to see an example of how it should not be done. It's possible",
          "A greate place to visit, but try to visit this place in the afternoon/night when its dark to see the beautiful light show that is on this \"Globe\" its one of the many beautiful places in Minsk to see",
          "I saw this building like stone at night. it's color has changed at each moment and it was awsome. If I went up to the top. I could see the overview of the city. but I couldn't for my schedule.",
          "Went to the top. Was rather expensive. There was a nice view. But dont really get what the fuzz is all about.",
          "This was definitely a highlight of my quick tour in Minsk. I paid the 30,000 rubles to go up to the top, and it was worth it! To see Minsk from all the way there was a treat. The building is a really interesting design, and there is a large park to the back of the building,",
          "Outstanding architecture. It's the pearl of Minsk. Very rich collection of books. One of the nicest libraries I have ever seen in the world. Totally worth seeing! I would even say a must!",
          "Great library. 23 stories. The surroundings include a massive courtyard and a park (lunch spot) with a river running through it. You can explore the first three floors, Wi-fI is available and the art work is nice. Then head up to the roof for some cool city views, though there",
          "Nice view from 22nd floor, poor cafe in 21st floor and- they must clean the windows for better panorama!",
          "I really like visiting the library. There are three floors where you can find not only books, but also you can see some exhibitions. For entering you can get a visitor IDcard for one visit or for 5 years (you can get information at infocenter), Also you can go up to the tower -",
          "While some people consider it as the most beautiful building in Belarus and say that it symbolises country I can say that it's the worst architecture ever, Shaped as a diamond...anyway in my opinion nothing interesting and excursions inside it are too boring even to pay for them",
          "Worth a quick look see. We simply drove past it. The architecture is unique and pretty on this building.",
          "Excellent view of the city of Minsk from the top. Worth a visit for the view including in the evening.",
          "Amazing place! Harmonically became a part of Minsk overall architecture design, very beautiful place",
          "The whole construction is beautiful and when you stand next to it it seems so big) I went there when it was closed as in Belorussia its very common that the half of the year they deduct to cleaning witch is called Subtonic or sanitary day.. I can say that its worth to see it cuz",
          "It is well worth taking the panoramic lift to the top, the views of the city are very impressive, and there is a coffee shop on top as well. I went on a clear summer day, but it is also open until 2300 hrs, so night views of the city are available.",
          "Paid 3000 rubles to see the art exhibitions and the book museum, then more to go up to panorama accessed via lift at the back of the place. Bit if bad planning to have to go outside and walk round to lift though. Interesting building to look at and good murals on the flats",
          "You can go with a escalatie up on the roof of this building. You have a view over Minsk. But within 5 minutes you have seen everything. The Art gallery is not interesting",
          "when i saw this building first time, i tought its a shopping center or hotel and then learn that its The National Library of Belarus, have interesting shape for a library, have amazing looking in green park, a real architectural symbol, there is a wall at outside something write",
          "Very interestingly designed building, nice architectural structure. The library lights up at night thus making this whole structure look amazing!",
          "It was very impressive for me when I visited the library. I think that may be inside it is even more beautifull than outside. There is also a nice scenic cafe where you can dine, and I am not sure but probably also the restaurant.",
          "It's like a space shuttle in the city. Near the bus station its a monument to be seen. Probably you will never see a library like this.",
          "the library building is unique one and one of the places that travellers should to see in Minsk. Expecially by night, when all builging is lightening. Also on the thop there have a see sight place, that you can see whole city, if the weather is good of course :) Also there is an",
          "it's really interesting building in terms of architecture. I enjoyed the panoramic view from the library- ideal for romantic dates. I attended it mostly when studying at the university- was quite helpful",
          "I do recommend to guests of our city to visit this site it's a symbol of Minsk,good to see both at day time or in the evening, to see the lightning.",
          "Very neo-Soviet design. I really love it, and I find that it fits well with general plan of the city. I understand there is a restaurant/cafe on the upper level, but this was closed during my time at the library because some foreign diplomats were visiting. There is a nice",
          "This construction is a must to visit! It's strange and beautiful at the same time. It's huge. Very light and spacious inside. Have contemporary technology - the books are delivered by special machines/elevators. Lots of art and interesting displays inside. On top there is an",
          "very good looking.. from the top you can see the river and a good nice part of the city.. great experience",
          "While the architecture is not really my cup of tea, I guess it's a conversation piece, and the view from the top is fantastic. I definitely recommend taking a ride up and looking over Minsk to see where you've been and where to go next. Beautiful views of the city on a nice",
          "Awesome view of all of Minsk from the National Library, not to mentions the ability to spot everywhere you want to go from one central place. Andrei made this experience informative, but also the launching pad to our next destination.",
          "Of all the buildings Belarus could have built, I don't think a library would have been high up the list of needs. Still, it's an impressive piece of architecture in an otherwise unimpressive district. Views from the top, whilst windy, are some of the best you'll get of Minsk",
          "People say that it was built using illegal money taking from goverment workers and they hate it. But it looks amazing at night, if you are in Minsk, you should see it.",
          "Not the nicest building in the city but an interesting one. A bit far from the downtown, but easily reachable with blue metro line. It is possible to go up to the top for a nice view but personally myself did not have the chance to do it due to rain. If you are around in evening",
          "This was a unique architectural edifice which really impressed. The guide did a wonderful job explaining how the library system works here. The building offered many places to read, study and be with literature. Tastefully decorated by many Belarusian artworks.",
          "We had a night visit. Fortunately the weather was really nice and we were able to stay for quite some time at the top. The city with its lights was looking exceptionally beautiful and got some nice pictures",
          "At day you can really appreciate the unique shape of the library. Do travel to the top using the panoramic lift. The views are breathtaking. Then at night it is all lit up with differing effects, Mesmerising.",
          "Very interesting architecture. Go to the top and get 360 degree view of Minsk. But better if you go with someone who can point out sights",
          "Make sure to take the elevator and go to the top platform to get a beautiful view of the surrounding suburbs! The building looks very interesting but unfortunately was close when we went!",
          "I'm a citizen of Minsk, the capital of Belarus where this Library is situated on the East part of the main city avenue. Its form is rhombocubeoctahedron (try to repeat please) and the Nick of its form is Chupa-Chups. It looks very nice in the evenings. It is the biggest book",
          "Greatly enjoy visiting the National Library and advise all the guests of Minsk come here as often as possible",
          "Took is a bit to figure how to get to the observation deck since there was no signage in English. It was around the back side it has a great view of the city from there. There was a cafe at the top but nothing in English to know what they had to offer.",
          "The library is the tallest building in Minsk. Its odd shape attracts visitors for many reasons. You can visit several rooms where you can find old books and popular. you can enjoy a spectacular 360 degree panorama on the roof of the building.",
          "An odd structured and futuristic building but its worth a trip. There is a statue to one of Belarus' leading educators (sorry I forgot the name temporarily) and there is some artwork inside the library. Near the heart of Minsk, so its easy to get there.",
          "If you have a library fetish - it is a cool place. Otherwise, driving by is enough. I am a cynic and for me the pictures would be enough.",
          "A little bit out of town,but easy accessible by Metro, you can find the brandnew national library of Minsk. You can discuss about the fact if you like the architecture, but it is at least an eyecatcher. For a couple of cents, you can go all the way up to the top, for a",
          "Nice place to visit. I have been there long ago with my parents and relatives: from the equipped roof you may enjoy wonderful sight",
          "An outstanding example of modernist architecture. One of the greatest buildings in the world. It is a truly inspiring centre of culture and knowledge.",
          "It's very very nice place. U can just walk around or look inside. Here is huge space with lots of rooms and halls. The entry is free. U just need to go left and get a pass. Excursions are also available for groups with previous request. After library the lift should be",
          "A very interesting building. In a dark time it looks like a screen with different images. Sometimes it looks like a national flag. If you go round the building you will see the entrans to a panoramic elevator and exit on the roof. You must pay for it only in cash and in BYR -",
          "I liked very much all the services they offer. Apart from reading a book, find reference material for an investigation, you may also leave your kids at the first floor been entertained by the staff of the kids room. There's also a panoramic view at the top of the building and",
          "Visited this library at dusk and purchased tickets to the observation deck on top of the library. A great place to watch the sunset and then after the sun sets, you will have a spectacular view of the city lights! Don't forget to bring your camera! The library building itself",
          "The first time I saw the library I was surprised at the architecture. I had no idea what the building was. My companion told me that it was a library and that it was built by President Lukashenko. She also explained that the president also built numerous sports complexes for",
          "A little bit far away from downtown, if you take the Minsk Tour bus, just the visit from outside is enough. Nobody inside nor outside. Although it is an iconic building of the city",
          "The National Library is one of the many interesting places in Minsk.It is not only a huge amount of interesting literature, but also an art gallery, observation deck, there is a cafe.From the observation deck offers a beautiful view of the entire city. An unforgettable",
          "I really like a lot of the night lights of the city. When I look at them from the roof of the library, I feel the rush of freedom. It's very beautiful. Through binoculars, which are there, you can consider any small parts of buildings. It's very interesting! I advise you to",
          "If you need to stay in the silence for a while, the National Library is a good choice. You can order a book or bring your laptop (wi-fi is available there) and perform your tasks, noone will disturb you. You can eat at the cafe, in the evening you can take the elevator up to the",
          "I have been a member of different libraries since age 7. The main library in Minsk is the biggest of them all, and most beautiful and modern looking. Apart from an enormous collection of books this library has places to eat out, an observation deck on the height of 23 story",
          "Very interesting and quite beautiful building, eventhough it was voted in top 10 ugliest buildings. It is definitely interesting and worth a quick wander around!",
          "First mos of ccitizens didn'tlike this \"chupa-chups\" idea of library (also most of them not voluntary conributed their money for that) but with time get used that is one of the most original building in minsk, Also as constant user can say that it well working (fast and",
          "The good thing was that there was one person who was able to speak english but when inside the library there was nothing special or made for visitors- everything in russian. Also went up to the terrace but also not worth because the area is not beautiful at all...",
          "No wi-fi, control as in the prison, no books can be brought inside. Service was very poor, personnel presume as any visitor is a potential thieve.",
          "This modern huge building dominates the outskirts of Minsk, and looks really strange, being cituated without any architectural support around.",
          "did not use it like a library but the building is quite unusual and odd and it was fun to go up to the observation platform on the roof. the day was good enough, albeit it cold, to see and good view of the city and surrounding countryside.",
          "National Library is our visit card on the road from airport to the city in many sences. We are well educated nations. We are talented and modern. We are looking for to a future.",
          "Well it is not for reading books that tourists are invited to visit the Library. No 24 out of World's Oddest buildings features an observation pad (enter from behind, 1200-2230 daily, BYR 8,000 per adult) on floor 23 while a floor lower there is a nice little cafe where you can",
          "Only plate to look from top, nothing more. Center of city is not seen. Great light in the evening - different colors, different forms.",
          "The library looks very grand and strange, therefore it contrast to the view of Misk as the city isn't very impressive. The town was destroyed during the war, so buildings are quite new, big and without any particular trimmings. I visited the museum with the group of",
          "As a professional librarian i have a keen interest for libraries all over the world. When i arrived in Minsk for the first time,it was around midnight. I remember the first sight of the library as a futuristic cube with flashing neon lights. Later i visited the library itself.",
          "I just passed by by car and saw this... thing. (in the Independance Avenue) Hem.. This is not very beautiful. Too much modernity. Of course in Minsk you have a lot of huge buildings with huge roads..., part of the communism. It's not without its charm. But this huge thing is",
          "This is a little outside the main area of the city but easy to reach via metro. The view from the top is outstanding because it really encapsulates much of what is Minsk. In one direction, there is a downtown area with its 5-10 story buildings. In another, there is a",
          "As the one of my friends said, \"its like they got the architects together and said, ok guys imagine what people in the 1960's would think the future would look like and lets build that!\". Reasonably accurate.. You can also go onto the roof and there is a decent view from the",

          "We've seen the building of National Library of Belarus during 3 hour Minsk bus tour. Keep in mind, that Minsk was hardly destroyed in Second World War and the Stalitn period building and especially buildings of late Soviet period were not interesting, so the building of",

          "Very impressive bilding with interesting design and cube form.",
          "Despite what you might read, this building is not diamond shaped, but rather is a rhombicuboctahedron. In any case, the bit most worth visiting if you are not a Russian speaker is the viewing platform at the top. Follow the signs to the platform access door. Do not enter the",
          "very big building, built in the shape of a diamond. To make the ressemblence undeniable, the whole building is \"covered\" by glass so it shines in the sun like a diamond... The library has a huge collection of Russian literature and only for this it's worth a visit. The country"

          "Were in the circus on the New Year's program, something is not very. Saturated can not be called. No acrobats, no predators .. Were in 2017 on the program \"Kind Stars\" more like it. But for children - the main thing \u2026",
          "Great place for all generations. It will be interesting for both children and adults. Very cool host of a circus show. But circus troupes are not always chic. It all depends on the program, because once in a while it \u2026",
          "Great New Year performance. Many times better than in the Palace of the Republic. Interesting characters, beautiful costumes, pretty artists and performers. The only thing that was sad was the room with the monkeys, \u2026",
          "Beautiful, elegant ... If wild animals were removed, it\u2019s generally wonderful ... Well, the artists are always at their best: we go every year for Christmas, my brother is happy: 4\n\n",
          "Children were delighted with the New Year's performance. Thank you for your work.\n\n",
          "Were on the program \"Circuses of the world.\" We are at least once a year. Tickets can also be redeemed from abroad. The best sectors for viewing are the 1st and 4th, and it is precisely to them that artists face first \u2026",
          "The building was built in 1959. It is the only circus in the world, which is located in the center of the capital, on the main street.\n\nThe building is adapted for showing all circus genres and keeping all animals, \u2026",
          "Today was at a performance with grandchildren! Comfortable, clean. A good performance for children, but little Santa Claus, 3-4 minutes at the end. Beautiful, well-groomed animals - the children were delighted. Good \u2026",
          "I love this place since childhood. I can already say a hundred percent that the Russian circus troupe is the best. They have funnier numbers and funnier clowns than everyone else. Since this is the only circus in \u2026",
          "Awful, just awful. We were with my family on December 31. For over 20 years we have been going to the circus, but we have never seen such a terrible performance. The game is disgusting, Santa Claus could not tie a \u2026",

          "Great New Year performance. Many times better than in the Palace of the Republic. Interesting characters, beautiful costumes, pretty artists and performers. The only thing that was sad was the room with the monkeys, \u2026",
          "Very good! Liked everything! Clean latrines, although the conveniences themselves remained Soviet))) there was practically no smell. The show program is fascinating. In the buffet would add variety, there would be a \u2026",
          "We went to the performance in early January, forgot the name, but the performance was excellent, about Princess Nesmeyannu. In total (tricks, laughter, animals) was enough and the performance passed in one breath. \u2026",
          "We went with the children, to the New Year\u2019s performance, a little tired, a very long time ... For me, children's performances should be done shorter in time. The numbers are interesting, but the animals seemed \u2026",
          "The water extravaganza went to the show. The clowns lifted the mood right away, it was fun and laid-back. The whole program was fascinating, looked with interest. Many thanks to the whole circus team for a great \u2026",
          "The New Year\u2019s program is so-so, it feels like it was created in haste, Santa Claus came out at the end for 5 minutes, and the whole story is about how they tried to cheer the princess, not a New Year\u2019s program at \u2026",
          "The New Year performance is just awful. Sick exhausted animals, animal trainers beating camels. Is it good. The very idea of an element of streptisis for children is that? People are you serious now is this a \u2026",
          "I love the circus since childhood., But I haven\u2019t been there for about 20 years. I happened to go with my nephew. I got a lot of pleasure. Good performance. First sat on the 1st row. Still, the difference is huge when \u2026",
          "I really liked the Bravo program. The seats are not comfortable, there is little distance between the seats. The child was satisfied, and so are we. I love when there are many rooms with animals. I also liked the \u2026",
          "Permanently cancel rooms. Not even a replacement. A canceled! You come to see some number, but it was canceled. Artists got sick, tigers rebelled, etc. The main thing is to cut down the money, and the performances \u2026",
          "Great circus! Very interesting programs (often changing). Invited to tour other countries. Prices are less.\n\n",
          "Beautiful place!!! Set a good mood! Great light, sound. And what a talented diverse artists !! I go with the children, but I am happy as a child)) Thank you, dear circus ministers!\n\n",
          "They were the whole family on December 23 in the circus on the New Year's program. The child (4 years old) really liked Baba Yaga, but after the intermission the child was noticeably tired, but this is not a minus \u2026",
          "It is a must when visiting Minsk, suitable for all ages, often the night show, but in the summer and the weekend is also a day, the number of members of the band is small but adept, the offer varies between animals \u2026",
          "Great New Year performance. Many times better than in the Palace of the Republic. Interesting characters, beautiful costumes, pretty artists and performers. The only thing that was sad was the room with the monkeys, \u2026",
          "The son barely survived barely half of the program, but this will not affect the assessment.\nThe theater begins with a buffet, why a circus? - I don\u2019t know, but after the wardrobe we headed to the buffet shocked by \u2026",
          "This place impresses me, and especially when the program is good.\n\n",
          "I must say right away that I am against a circus with animals! The horses were frankly thin with scanty tails. And the bears ... White tigers, apparently, the only ones fed. Gymnasts and juggler and clowns were good! \u2026",
          "We watched the program of Nikulin's circus on the colored boulevard. Expected more. As for the circus - I want to praise the wonderful face painting, which can be done during intermission for a child, and make a \u2026",
          "Good New Year performance! From animals camels, monkeys, dogs, parrots. All. Not enough. There were practically no acrobats, but it is very interesting for children.\n\n",
          "Just a good circus.\nHow much an interesting performance depends on the whole program and guest artists. So once at a time.\nYou can take a photo with animals.\nOnce there was a circus museum, perhaps there is now. Nice \u2026",
          "Our family really liked the show \"Water extravaganza\" !!! Bears, seals, dogs, monkeys, acrobats, and the whole water show, and most importantly ... fountains ..., beauty, got a huge pleasure from what they saw \u2026",
          "Wonderful circus !!! The same as it was in my Soviet childhood !!! Inexpensive tickets (in comparison with Moscow prices). Very interesting program. During the performance, I never looked at the clock. The child \u2026",
          "Very lively place! Here and children's laughter, and humble and unpredictable, animals, elegant tricks or mysterious tricks. Yes, a lot of fun and interesting! Childhood and the circus are inseparable things! \u2026",
          "The water extravaganza is, of course, a very interesting performance, but ... In the hall, as usual, the majority are children, why is there a gymnast in such a frankly erotic plan in a room with a white shirt ?? \u2026",
          "Was at the New Year's fabulous performance \"In one kingdom, in one state ...\" We walked in a company without children, a good performance. There would be fewer animals, they are always sorry ... And so the costumes \u2026",
          "A circus is nothing like that ... Smart animals that you see live. Wonderfully rehearsed rooms. Great holiday atmosphere\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\n\n",
          "Awesome place! I support the tradition of visiting the circus in the New Year period. Excellent performances that will delight lovers of different genres: trained animals, air acrobats, clowns ... Live music and \u2026",

          "Good programs. Funny clown. Cool presenter.\n\n",
          "It\u2019s better to come in advance and buy a meal or popcorn before the performance starts. During the intermission, there are gigantic lines and everything ends quickly :( The circus program comes back every time. \u2026",
          "For me, an adult, the circus always remained an opportunity to plunge into childhood. This time, as always, I received a lot of pleasure. Muscovites from the Nikulinsky circus brought a good program, both children and \u2026",
          "Take a small selection in the cafe with you. Extra charge of 200 percent. It\u2019s a shame for such a service.\n\n",
          "The circus is chic, the programs are just fantastic, the children and adults are thrilled. A slight inconvenience is the lack of parking.\n\n",
          "I like everything, but lately the ticket prices have grown up decently and only local Belarusians appear on the water show. There is deception on the poster, there are only fountains in the arena, there were no marine \u2026",
          "A very interesting program, my child was about two years old, sat and watched with pleasure, applauded and endured to the end, as it seems to me, and could last even longer b. Before the start of the performance, \u2026",
          "It was very interesting to visit the circus, the child liked it.\n\n",
          "I was not in the circus, but for one design of the territory - unambiguous 5 stars. While I was considering interesting statues, I saw how tourists fit and take pictures with each of them. Such details are the \u2026",
          "Joy for the whole family. Holiday every day. The best traditions of circus art in one of the best arenas in the world. International-class circus performances are performed by artists from around the world. A must \u2026",
          "Very bad places in the box, although they were sitting in the front row of the box. The child can\u2019t see anything at all. The cost of one ticket is 75 rubles, for two 150 rubles. There are chairs in the box, legs rest \u2026",
          "I haven\u2019t been to the circus for a long time. The daughter grew up and was somehow not accepted by the adults in the circus, and here the daughter bought tickets and you know I was pleasantly surprised by the repair, \u2026",
          "I drove my son to the New Year show! He liked it, I\u2019m not all (probably getting old))). Prices bite, and I'm not talking about tickets;). Do you want the child not to be deprived - do not forget to take with you \u2026",
          "Most recently, I went to the circus with my daughter. I really liked the program. I will not reveal all the secrets. In places there was wild delight, in places it was scary to goosebumps, and a smile from ear to ear \u2026",
          "A very beautiful building did not go inside but the outside is very beautiful. Huge columns. Around it is very clean. There are beautiful sculptures and monuments. I really liked the building itself, I hope to go \u2026",
          "The performance is designed exclusively for children. Unfortunately, the artists completely forgot about the first and second sectors, there were numbers when you had to look only at the backs of the artists. But some \u2026",
          "Were in the circus, everything is very cool. Animators, photos, and the performance itself is simply gorgeous. I liked the fact that this multi-colored painted clown was not tired of already, but here everything is \u2026",
          "Frankly not very, a small arena, in the hall it smells of animal excrement, everything is very expensive and does not correspond to prices. For children under 5 years old it will still be interesting, but the older \u2026",
          "Circus performance was held at the highest level. We were pleased with the circus performances, the performance of artists and the host. Everything went in one breath. I recommend to visit the whole family. \u2026",
          "This is just a fairy tale! Never been to a stationary circus. It is breathtaking already at the entrance. Everything is beautiful, fabulous and unusual. Ironically, the program was performed by the Moscow Nikulin \u2026",
          "Our circus is always a holiday! We have been walking since childhood, already with our grandchildren, and what always pleases us is that a wonderful mood is created even before the performance!\n\n",
          "Every year we go to the circus, the program is always different, a fun colorful show, both children and adults like it\n\n",
          "Very fabulous, interesting and fun. Baby is always thrilled\n\n",
          "Armchairs for visitors are anti-comfortable, narrow aisles, buffet prices are quite expensive hot dog 5 rubles., Tea bag 3 rubles. Vata 3p. Popcorn 5r. For the middle layer of the population I consider it expensive. \u2026",
          "The children were thrilled. Very interesting performance. Thanks to the circus performers.\n\n",

          "Had a great time. Children are delighted, adults again fell into childhood. Must visit !!!\n\n",
          "The first time was in this circus, I liked everything very much, I will come again.\n\n",

          "Skinny animals pacing like zombies in small cages, it was sad to watch. My 3 year old didnt understand that of course, and was still excited to see some animals, but its not worth it. Service inside the zoo was also bad. Toilets are not for the faint of heart, and we did not",
          "Don't expect anything even close to modern ZOO of the 21st century. Perhaps I expect too much? Small cages and desperate animals in them. A single zebra animal with no green and space. In one of the largest and obviously most modern enclosures, they keep domestic rabbits whileas",
          "So first, without having a discussion on should we run zoo's in the world or no, this zoo is quite good. There are ALOT of animals from all kind as this place is huge. It is true, sometimes it seems that some of the animals could be kept in larger spaces. Besides that, it was",
          "I visited this place and was not expecting that many number of exhibits since nothing is that large in Minsk but I was in for a surprise. Although this place houses a number of animals, insects and fishes I do feel like the enclosures could be larger so as to allow these",

          "The zoo is quite small and the cages are too little for the animals. Two hours are enough to see all of them. But at the same time some rare species can be found there (like a white tiger) and one can take a look at them very closely. Besides the zoo itself there is a dinopark,",

          "Dolphibs show was amasing. All of us children and adults liked it. Zoo itself is very big and has a lot of deferent areas. Recomended!!!",
          "I was there before and if not for my kids begging to go there I wouldn't visit again. The animal enclosures are way too small. Big cats are kept on a territory that is not suitable for their size, no space to run at all thus they lay and sleep all day gaining weight. this is",
          "Horrible facilities, no space for the animals, the person selling tickets was rude and didn't give information.",

          "This Zoo has grew from small \"animal corner\". Every year it become better. Some aviaries are small and not comfortable for animal. But every time I see something new.",
          "A small zoo on the outskirts of Minsk. Looks a bit like an image from one of my nightmares. Animals are kept in tiny cages, very distressing to see the bear pacing back and forth. Clearly very unhappy. The smaller animals are kept in much nicer circumstances. Very little else",
          "This is an old time zoo. When I saw the Big cats and bears in small enclosures pacing and depressed, it broke my heart, and it caused me to leave in tears... This, to me, is cruelty to animals... :'(",
          "Now the consept of zoo changing - more space for animals, mor decorations of natural enviroment. But this zoo is still holds most of anomals in small cages with nothing inside. Even zoo in Grodno is better."

        "wiki": "Minsk (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a [m\u02b2insk], Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) is the capital and largest city of Belarus, located on the Svisla\u010d and the Nyamiha Rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom. A good example is St. Elisabeth's Convent, founded in 1999.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nKalvaryja (Calvary Cemetery) is the oldest surviving cemetery in the city. Many famous people of Belarus are buried here. The cemetery was closed to new burials in the 1960s.\nMilitary Cemetery\nEastern Cemetery\n\u010cy\u017eo\u016dskija Cemetery\nNorthern Cemetery\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nMajor theatres are:\n\nNational Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus \nBelarusian State Musical Theatre (performances in Russian)\nMaxim Gorky National Drama Theatre (performances in Russian)\nYanka Kupala National Drama Theatre (performances in Belarusian)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nMajor museums include:\n\nBelarusian National Arts Museum\nBelarusian Great Patriotic War Museum\nBelarusian National History and Culture Museum\nBelarusian Nature and Environment Museum\nMaksim Bahdanovi\u010d Literary Museum\nOld Belarusian History Museum\nYanka Kupala Literary MuseumArt galleries include:\n\n\u040e gallery\n\n\n=== Recreation areas ===\nChelyuskinites Park\nChildren's Railroad\nGorky Park (Minsk)\nYanka Kupala Park\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are more than 400 travel agencies in Minsk, about a quarter of them provide agent activity, and most of them are tour operators.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\nFC Dinamo Minsk\nFC Minsk\nFC Torpedo Minsk\nFC Energetik-BGU Minsk\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nHC Dinamo Minsk\nHC Yunost Minsk\n\n\n=== Handball ===\nSKA Minsk\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nBC Tsmoki-Minsk\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\nIn 2013, Minsk hosted the European Junior Rowing Championships at the Republican Center of Olympic Training for Rowing And Canoeing to the north-west of the city.Minsk hosted the 2014 IIHF World Championship at the Minsk Arena.\nIn January 2016, the 2016 European Speed Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena. Minsk Arena is the only indoor speed skating rink in Belarus.\nOn 21 October 2016, it was confirmed by the European Olympic Committee that Minsk will host the 2019 European Games.\nThe 2019 European Figure Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena from the 21st to 27 January.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nMinsk has an extensive public transport system. Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, Smolensk, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nAccording to the survey in 2019 (were interviewed 1934 people), in Minsk around 811 thousand of adult bicycles plus 232 thousand of child and adolescent bicycles. In Minsk one bike is for 1.9 people. The total number of bicycles in Minsk exceeds the total number of Cars (770 thousand of personal automobiles). 39% of Minsk residents have a personal bike. 43% of Minsk residents ride a bicycle once a month or more. As of 2017, the level of bicycle use is about 1% of all transport movements (for comparison: 12% in Berlin, 50% in Copenhagen).\n\nSince 2015, a bicycle parade / bicycle carnival held in Minsk, during which vehicles are blocked for several hours along Pobediteley (Peramohi) Avenue (one of the main streets of Minsk). The number of participants in 2019 was more than 20 thousand, the number of registrations was about 12 thousand.In 2017, the European Union funded the project \"Urban cycling in Belarus\" in the amount of 560 thousand euros, within the framework of which the public association Minsk Cycling Society together with the Council of Ministers created the regulatory document National Concept for the Development of Cycling in Belarus.\n\nSince 2013, a free public workshop \"Bicycle Kitchen Garage 38\" has been operating in Minsk, where everyone can use the tool and help repairing the bicycle. Free bike school works.In 2020, Minsk entered the top 3 most cycling cities in the CIS \u2013 after Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nMinsk National Airport is located 42 km (26 mi) to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current railway station opened in 1987. It is an international airport with flights to Europe and the Middle East.Minsk-1 opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1 million passengers a year.From 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, Kiev and Kaliningrad. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as Minsk-City.Minsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is located in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges, and 29 higher education institutions, including 12 major national universities.\n\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\nAcademy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

          "I love this place. A very good collection of the Russian painting of XVII-the beginning of XX centures. And, of course, the best collection of the Belarusian art, painting, sculpture and some beautiful things of Christian art of Belarus of former centuries.",
          "Not the greatest art museum in the world but still interesting for getting a good overview of Belarusian art history and has also quite a few works from famous painters. Temporary exhibitions can be very good, too.",
          "Good museum with nice collections \ud83d\udc4c\nLighting makes enjoying some pieces, rather difficult though",
          "The museum is great. There are a lot of beautiful painting and sculptures. Highly recommend.",
          "It's simple building but with rather reach and complete collections and more, very kind people and they know about what they speak. They need, as usual in such type of cultural sphere, money. So don't hesitate go, visit and at the end, when you are tired, enjoy a drink.",
          "Nice building with a very interesting collection. A must see for any art/culture lover visiting Minsk.",
          "Its all right, but nothing special. This is not the museums fault, just simply incomparable with those from St. Petersburg, Moscow, Paris, London. Etc. IMHO",
          "Unfortunately big part of museum was closed for reconstruction when visited this place. But I still loved everything I saw and recommend everyone to visit this museum. I honestly can't wait to come back and still whole place. Entrance fee is only 6rubles which is approximately $3",

          "Both old and contemporary art in one museum. Worthy to go",
          "It mixes the old with the new. Signage was in the international language. It appears none of the security/guards do. They also fail to shut down people walking around talking on their phone. It's very hard to enjoy the beauty of the museum with idiots talking loudly on the phone.",
          "Compared to similar museums in other countries this is not a very big one, but it holds an excellent exhibition (mostly of  paintings and some sculptures) by some great artists. The entry costs only 6byn, so there is no reason of  thinking it too much. It really worths a visit.",
          "Its small but organized, they have some temp and permanent thing. The little cute cafe is nice and it tastes good. The employees are knowledgeable and pretty friendly(although some take time to warm-up, those end up the best people). Over all I recommend to visit this place.",

          "Worth seeing.",
          "Don't expect good attitude. Came 30 minutes before closing to check small exhibition, but was not welcome. A lot of people watch you over the exhibition, which is not quite comfortable. Wish there were more friendliness in service.",

          "It wasn\u2019t the food that inspired me on this short trip to Minsk, it was the artworks of one 19th century landscape painter, Ivan Aivazovsky. His piece \u201cNight at Rodos Island\u201d is sublime. The art works in this large gallery are expansive in \u2026",

          "Must go cheap money rich experience",
          "This museum, although not big has always some interesting exposition going on. The paintings are not stacked one above the other and the illumination of the building is really well done. The cheap prices for the ticket make it an inexpensive visit.",

        "wiki": "The October Revolution (commonly referred to as the Bolshevik Revolution, the October Uprising, or Red October), officially known in Soviet historiography as the Great October Socialist Revolution, was a revolution in Russia led by the Bolshevik Party of Vladimir Lenin that was instrumental in the larger Russian Revolution of 1917\u20131923. It took place through an armed insurrection in Petrograd on 25 October (Old Style, O.S.; 7 November, New Style or N.S.) 1917.\nThe October Revolution had followed and capitalized on the February Revolution  earlier in the year. The February Revolution had overthrown the Tsarist autocracy, resulting in a provisional government. The provisional government had taken power after being proclaimed by Grand Duke Michael, Tsar Nicholas II's younger brother, who declined to take power after the Tsar stepped down.\nDuring this time, urban workers began to organize into councils (soviets) wherein revolutionaries criticized the provisional government and its actions. After the Congress of Soviets, the new governing body, had its second session it elected members of the Bolsheviks and other left-wing groups such as the Left Socialist Revolutionaries (Left SR) to important positions within the new state of affairs. This immediately initiated the establishment of the Russian Soviet Republic. On 17 July 1918, the Tsar and his family, including his five children aged 13 to 22, were executed.\nThe revolution was led by the Bolsheviks, who used their influence in the Petrograd Soviet to organize the armed forces. Bolshevik Red Guards forces under the Military-Revolutionary Committee began the occupation of government buildings on 25 October (O.S.; 7 November, N.S.), 1917. The following day, the Winter Palace (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia) was captured.\nThe slogan of the October revolution was All Power to the Soviets, meaning all power to grassroots democratically elected councils. For a time, this was observed, with the interim Bolshevik-only Sovnarkom or Soviet government replaced by a Bolshevik-Left SR coalition government with an All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets composed of all representatives of all factions who supported Soviet power and legally entrenching the peasant land seizures. Throughout 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which resulted in a Left SR walkout, and other policies disputed by both the other pro-soviet parties and minority factions of the Bolsheviks progressively dissipated until 1920, where there were no free elections, but delegates were appointed by a one-party state.\nThe long-awaited Constituent Assembly elections were held on 12 November (O.S., 25 November, N.S.) 1917. In contrast to their majority in the Soviets, the Bolsheviks only won 175 seats in the 715-seat legislative body, coming in second behind the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which won 370 seats, although the SR Party no longer existed as a whole party by that time, as the Left SRs had gone into coalition with the Bolsheviks from October 1917 to March 1918 (a cause of dispute of the legitimacy of the returned seating of the Constituent Assembly, as the old lists, were drawn up by the old SR Party leadership, and thus represented mostly Right SRs, whereas the peasant soviet deputies had returned majorities for the pro-Bolshevik Left SRs). The Constituent Assembly was to first meet on 28 November (O.S.) 1917, but its convocation was delayed until 5 January (O.S.; 18 January, N.S.) 1918 by the Bolsheviks. On its first and only day in session, the Constituent Assembly came into conflict with the Soviets, and it rejected Soviet decrees on peace and land, resulting in the Constituent Assembly being dissolved the next day by order of the Congress of Soviets.As the revolution was not universally recognized, there followed the struggles of the Russian Civil War (1917\u201322) and the creation of the Soviet Union in 1922.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nAt first, the event was referred to as the \"October coup\" (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442) or the \"Uprising of the 3rd,\" as seen in contemporary documents (for example, in the first editions of Lenin's complete works). However, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 has a meaning similar to \"revolution\" and also means \"upheaval\" or \"overturn\", so \"coup\" is not necessarily the correct translation.\nWith time, the term \"October Revolution\" (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f) came into use. It is also known as the \"November Revolution\" having occurred in November, according to the Gregorian Calendar (for details, see Soviet calendar).\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== February Revolution ===\n\nThe February Revolution had toppled Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and replaced his government with the Russian Provisional Government. However, the provisional government was weak and riven by internal dissension. It continued to wage World War I, which became increasingly unpopular. There was a nationwide crisis affecting social, economic, and political relations. Disorder in industry and transport had intensified, and difficulties in obtaining provisions had increased. Gross industrial production in 1917 decreased by over 36% of what it had been in 1914. In the autumn, as much as 50% of all enterprises in the Urals, the Donbas, and other industrial centers were closed down, leading to mass unemployment. At the same time, the cost of living increased sharply. Real wages fell to about 50% of what they had been in 1913. By October 1917, Russia's national debt had risen to 50 billion rubles. Of this, debts to foreign governments constituted more than 11 billion rubles. The country faced the threat of financial bankruptcy.\n\n\n=== Unrest by workers, peasants, and soldiers ===\nThroughout June, July, and August 1917, it was common to hear working-class Russians speak about their lack of confidence in the Provisional Government. Factory workers around Russia felt unhappy with the growing shortages of food, supplies, and other materials. They blamed their managers or foremen and would even attack them in the factories. The workers blamed many rich and influential individuals for the overall shortage of food and poor living conditions. Workers saw these rich and powerful individuals as opponents of the Revolution, and called them \"bourgeois\", \"capitalist\", and \"imperialist\".In September and October 1917, there were mass strike actions by the Moscow and Petrograd workers, miners in the Donbas, metalworkers in the Urals, oil workers in Baku, textile workers in the Central Industrial Region, and railroad workers on 44 railway lines. In these months alone, more than a million workers took part in strikes. Workers established control over production and distribution in many factories and plants in a social revolution. Workers organized these strikes through factory committees. The factory committees represented the workers and were able to negotiate better working conditions, pay, and hours. Even though workplace conditions may have been increasing in quality, the overall quality of life for workers was not improving. There were still shortages of food and the increased wages workers had obtained did little to provide for their families.By October 1917, peasant uprisings were common. By autumn, the peasant movement against the landowners had spread to 482 of 624 counties, or 77% of the country. As 1917 progressed, the peasantry increasingly began to lose faith that the land would be distributed to them by the Social Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks. Refusing to continue living as before, they increasingly took measures into their own hands, as can be seen by the increase in the number and militancy of the peasant's actions. From the beginning of September to the October Revolution there were over a third as many peasant actions than since March. Over 42% of all the cases of destruction (usually burning down and seizing property from the landlord's estate) recorded between February and October occurred in October. While the uprisings varied in severity, complete uprisings and seizures of the land were not uncommon. Less robust forms of protest included marches on landowner manors and government offices, as well as withholding and storing grains rather than selling them. When the Provisional Government sent punitive detachments, it only enraged the peasants. In September, the garrisons in Petrograd, Moscow, and other cities, the Northern and Western fronts, and the sailors of the Baltic Fleet declared through their elected representative body Tsentrobalt that they did not recognize the authority of the Provisional Government and would not carry out any of its commands.Soldiers' wives were key players in the unrest in the villages. From 1914 to 1917, almost 50% of healthy men were sent to war, and many were killed on the front, resulting in many females being head of the household. Often\u2014when government allowances were late and were not sufficient to match the rising costs of goods\u2014soldiers' wives sent masses of appeals to the government, which went largely unanswered. Frustration resulted, and these women were influential in inciting \"subsistence riots\"\u2014also referred to as \"hunger riots,\" \"pogroms,\" or \"baba riots.\" In these riots, citizens seized food and resources from shop owners, who they believed to be charging unfair prices. Upon police intervention, protesters responded with \"rakes, sticks, rocks, and fists.\"\n\n\n=== Antiwar demonstrations ===\nIn a diplomatic note of 1 May, the minister of foreign affairs, Pavel Milyukov, expressed the Provisional Government's desire to continue the war against the Central Powers \"to a victorious conclusion\", arousing broad indignation. On 1\u20134 May, about 100,000 workers and soldiers of Petrograd, and, after them, the workers and soldiers of other cities, led by the Bolsheviks, demonstrated under banners reading \"Down with the war!\" and \"All power to the soviets!\" The mass demonstrations resulted in a crisis for the Provisional Government. 1 July saw more demonstrations, as about 500,000 workers and soldiers in Petrograd demonstrated, again demanding \"all power to the soviets,\" \"down with the war,\" and \"down with the ten capitalist ministers.\" The Provisional Government opened an offensive against the Central Powers on 1 July, which soon collapsed. The news of the offensive's failure intensified the struggle of the workers and the soldiers. A new crisis in the Provisional Government began on 15 July.\n\n\n=== July days ===\n\nOn 16 July, spontaneous demonstrations of workers and soldiers began in Petrograd, demanding that power be turned over to the soviets. The Central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party provided leadership to the spontaneous movements. On 17 July, over 500,000 people participated in what was intended to be a peaceful demonstration in Petrograd, the so-called July Days. The Provisional Government, with the support of Socialist-Revolutionary Party-Menshevik leaders of the All-Russian Executive Committee of the Soviets, ordered an armed attack against the demonstrators, killing hundreds.A period of repression followed. On 5\u20136 July, attacks were made on the editorial offices and printing presses of Pravda and on the Palace of Kshesinskaya, where the Central Committee and the Petrograd Committee of the Bolsheviks were located. On 7 July, the government ordered the arrest and trial of Vladimir Lenin, who was forced to go underground, as he had done under the Tsarist regime. Bolsheviks were arrested, workers were disarmed, and revolutionary military units in Petrograd were disbanded or sent to the war front. On 12 July, the Provisional Government published a law introducing the death penalty at the front. The second coalition government was formed on 24 July, chaired by Alexander Kerensky.In response to a Bolshevik appeal, Moscow's working class began a protest strike of 400,000 workers. They were supported by strikes and protest rallies by workers in Kiev, Kharkov, Nizhny Novgorod, Ekaterinburg, and other cities.\n\n\n=== Kornilov affair ===\n\nIn what became known as the Kornilov affair, General Lavr Kornilov, who had been Commander-in-Chief since 18 July, with Kerensky's agreement directed an army under Aleksandr Krymov to march toward Petrograd to restore order. Details remain sketchy, but Kerensky appeared to become frightened by the possibility that the army would stage a coup, and reversed the order. By contrast, historian Richard Pipes has argued that the episode was engineered by Kerensky. On 27 August, feeling betrayed by the government, Kornilov pushed on towards Petrograd. With few troops to spare at the front, Kerensky turned to the Petrograd Soviet for help. Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, and Socialist Revolutionaries confronted the army and convinced them to stand down. The Bolsheviks' influence over railroad and telegraph workers also proved vital in stopping the movement of troops. Right-wingers felt betrayed, and the left-wing was resurgent.\nWith Kornilov defeated, the Bolsheviks' popularity in the soviets grew significantly, both in the central and local areas. On 31 August, the Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies\u2014and, on 5 September, the Moscow Soviet Workers Deputies\u2014adopted the Bolshevik resolutions on the question of power. The Bolsheviks won a majority in the soviets of Briansk, Samara, Saratov, Tsaritsyn, Minsk, Kiev, Tashkent, and other cities.\n\n\n=== German support ===\nVladimir Lenin, who had been living in exile in Switzerland, with other dissidents organized a plan to negotiate a passage for them through Germany, with whom Russia was then at war. Recognizing that these dissidents could cause problems for their Russian enemies, the German government agreed to permit 32 Russian citizens, among them Lenin and his wife, to travel in a sealed train carriage through their territory. According to Deutsche Welle:\n\nOn November 7, 1917, a coup d'\u00e9tat went down in history as the October Revolution. The interim government was toppled, the Soviets seized power, and Russia later terminated the Triple Entente military alliance with France and Britain. For Russia, it was effectively the end of the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II had spent around half a billion euros ($582 million) in today's money to weaken his wartime enemy.\n\n\n== Insurrection ==\n\n\n=== Planning ===\n\nOn 10 October 1917 (O.S.; 23 October, N.S.), the Bolsheviks' Central Committee voted 10\u20132 for a resolution saying that \"an armed uprising is inevitable, and that the time for it is fully ripe.\" At the Committee meeting, Lenin discussed how the people of Russia had waited long enough for \"an armed uprising,\" and it was the Bolsheviks' time to take power. Lenin expressed his confidence in the success of the planned insurrection. His confidence stemmed from months of Bolshevik buildup of power and successful elections to different committees and councils in major cities such as Petrograd and Moscow.The Bolsheviks created a revolutionary military committee within the Petrograd soviet, led by the soviet's president, Trotsky. The committee included armed workers, sailors, and soldiers, and assured the support or neutrality of the capital's garrison. The committee methodically planned to occupy strategic locations through the city, almost without concealing their preparations: the Provisional Government's president Kerensky was himself aware of them; and some details, leaked by Kamenev and Zinoviev, were published in newspapers.\n\n\n=== Onset ===\nIn the early morning of 24 October (O.S.; 6 November N.S.), a group of soldiers loyal to Kerensky's government marched on the printing house of the Bolshevik newspaper, Rabochiy put (Worker's Path), seizing and destroying printing equipment and thousands of newspapers. Shortly thereafter, the government announced the immediate closure of not only Rabochiy put but also the left-wing Soldat, as well as the far-right newspapers Zhivoe slovo and Novaia Rus. The editors and contributors of these newspapers were seen to be calling for insurrection and were to be prosecuted on criminal charges.In response, at 9 a.m. the Bolshevik Military-Revolutionary Committee issued a statement denouncing the government's actions. At 10 a.m., Bolshevik-aligned soldiers successfully retook the Rabochiy put printing house. Kerensky responded at approximately 3 p.m. that afternoon by ordering the raising of all but one of Petrograd's bridges, a tactic used by the government several months earlier during the July Days. What followed was a series of sporadic clashes over control of the bridges, between Red Guard militias aligned with the Military-Revolutionary Committee and military units still loyal to the government. At approximately 5 p.m. the Military-Revolutionary Committee seized the Central Telegraph of Petrograd, giving the Bolsheviks control over communications through the city.On 25 October (O.S.; 7 November, N.S.) 1917, the Bolsheviks led their forces in the uprising in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg, then capital of Russia) against the Provisional Government. The event coincided with the arrival of a pro-Bolshevik flotilla\u2014consisting primarily of five destroyers and their crews, as well as marines\u2014in Petrograd harbor. At Kronstadt, sailors announced their allegiance to the Bolshevik insurrection. In the early morning, from its heavily guarded and picketed headquarters in Smolny Palace, the Military-Revolutionary Committee designated the last of the locations to be assaulted or seized. The Red Guards systematically captured major government facilities, key communication installations, and vantage points with little opposition. The Petrograd Garrison and most of the city's military units joined the insurrection against the Provisional Government. The insurrection was timed and organized to hand state power to the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, which began on this day.\nKerensky and the Provisional Government were virtually helpless to offer significant resistance. Railways and railway stations had been controlled by Soviet workers and soldiers for days, making rail travel to and from Petrograd impossible for Provisional Government officials. The Provisional Government was also unable to locate any serviceable vehicles. On the morning of the insurrection, Kerensky desperately searched for a means of reaching military forces he hoped would be friendly to the Provisional Government outside the city and ultimately borrowed a Renault car from the American embassy, which he drove from the Winter Palace, along with a Pierce Arrow. Kerensky was able to evade the pickets going up around the palace and to drive to meet approaching soldiers.As Kerensky left Petrograd, Lenin wrote a proclamation To the Citizens of Russia, stating that the Provisional Government had been overthrown by the Military-Revolutionary Committee. The proclamation was sent by telegraph throughout Russia, even as the pro-Soviet soldiers were seizing important control centers throughout the city. One of Lenin's intentions was to present members of the Soviet congress, who would assemble that afternoon, with a fait accompli and thus forestall further debate on the wisdom or legitimacy of taking power.\n\n\n=== Assault on the Winter Palace ===\nA final assault against the Winter Palace\u2014against 3,000 cadets, officers, cossacks, and female soldiers\u2014wasn't vigorously resisted. The Bolsheviks delayed the assault because they could not find functioning artillery and acted with restraint to avoid needless violence. At 6:15 p.m., a large group of artillery cadets abandoned the palace, taking their artillery with them. At 8:00 p.m., 200 cossacks left the palace and returned to their barracks.While the cabinet of the provisional government within the palace debated what action to take, the Bolsheviks issued an ultimatum to surrender. Workers and soldiers occupied the last of the telegraph stations, cutting off the cabinet's communications with loyal military forces outside the city. As the night progressed, crowds of insurgents surrounded the palace, and many infiltrated it. At 9:45 p.m, the cruiser Aurora fired a blank shot from the harbor. Some of the revolutionaries entered the palace at 10:25 p.m. and there was a mass entry 3 hours later.\nBy 2:10 a.m. on 26 October, Bolshevik forces had gained control. The Cadets and the 140 volunteers of the Women's Battalion surrendered rather than resist the 40,000 strong attacking force. After sporadic gunfire throughout the building, the cabinet of the Provisional Government surrendered, and were imprisoned in Peter and Paul Fortress. The only member who was not arrested was Kerensky himself, who had already left the palace.With the Petrograd Soviet now in control of government, garrison, and proletariat, the Second All Russian Congress of Soviets held its opening session on the day, while Trotsky dismissed the opposing Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries (SR) from Congress.\n\n\n=== Dybenko's disputed role ===\nSome sources contend that as the leader of Tsentrobalt, Pavlo Dybenko played a crucial role in the revolt and that the ten warships that arrived at the city with ten thousand Baltic Fleet mariners were the force that took the power in Petrograd and put down the Provisional Government. The same mariners then dispersed by force the elected parliament of Russia, and used machine-gun fire against demonstrators in Petrograd, killing about 100 demonstrators and wounding several hundred. Dybenko in his memoirs mentioned this event as \"several shots in the air\". These are disputed by various sources, such as Louise Bryant, who claims that news outlets in the West at the time reported that the unfortunate loss of life occurred in Moscow, not Petrograd, and the number was much less than suggested above. As for the \"several shots in the air\", there is little evidence suggesting otherwise.\n\n\n=== Later Soviet portrayal ===\nWhile the seizure of the Winter Palace happened almost without resistance, Soviet historians and officials later tended to depict the event in dramatic and heroic terms. The historical reenactment titled The Storming of the Winter Palace was staged in 1920. This reenactment, watched by 100,000 spectators, provided the model for official films made later, which showed fierce fighting during the storming of the Winter Palace, although, in reality, the Bolshevik insurgents had faced little opposition.Later stories of the heroic \"Storming of the Winter Palace\" and \"defense of the Winter Palace\" were propaganda by Bolshevik publicists. Grandiose paintings depicting the \"Women's Battalion\" and photo stills taken from Sergei Eisenstein's staged film depicting the \"politically correct\" version of the October events in Petrograd came to be taken as truth.\n\n\n== Outcome ==\n\n\n=== New government established ===\nThe Second Congress of Soviets consisted of 670 elected delegates: 300 were Bolshevik and nearly 100 were Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who also supported the overthrow of the Alexander Kerensky government. When the fall of the Winter Palace was announced, the Congress adopted a decree transferring power to the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, thus ratifying the Revolution.\nThe transfer of power was not without disagreement. The center and right wings of the Socialist Revolutionaries, as well as the Mensheviks, believed that Lenin and the Bolsheviks had illegally seized power and they walked out before the resolution was passed. As they exited, they were taunted by Trotsky who told them \"You are pitiful isolated individuals; you are bankrupts; your role is played out. Go where you belong from now on \u2014 into the dustbin of history!\"The following day, 26 October, the Congress elected a new cabinet of Bolsheviks, pending the convocation of a Constituent Assembly. This new Soviet government was known as the Council (Soviet) of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom), with Lenin as a leader. Lenin allegedly approved of the name, reporting that it \"smells of revolution\". The cabinet quickly passed the Decree on Peace and the Decree on Land. This new government was also officially called \"provisional\" until the Assembly was dissolved.\n\n\n=== Anti-Bolshevik sentiment ===\nThat same day, posters were pinned on walls and fences by the right-wing Socialist Revolutionaries, describing the takeover as a \"crime against the motherland\" and \"revolution\"; this signaled the next wave of anti-Bolshevik sentiment. The next day, the Mensheviks seized power in Georgia and declared it an independent republic; the Don Cossacks also claimed control of their government. The Bolshevik strongholds were in the cities, particularly Petrograd, with support much more mixed in rural areas. The peasant-dominated Left SR party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. There were reports that the Provisional Government had not conceded defeat and were meeting with the army at the Front.\nAnti-Bolshevik sentiment continued to grow as posters and newspapers started criticizing the actions of the Bolsheviks and refuted their authority. The Executive Committee of Peasants Soviets \"[refuted] with indignation all participation of the organized peasantry in this criminal violation of the will of the working class\". This eventually developed into major counter-revolutionary action, as on the 30th October (O.S., 12 November, N.S.) when cossacks, welcomed by church bells, entered Tsarskoye Selo on the outskirts of Petrograd with Kerensky riding on a white horse. Kerensky gave an ultimatum to the rifle garrison to lay down weapons, which was promptly refused. They were then fired upon by Kerensky's cossacks, which resulted in 8 deaths. This turned soldiers in Petrograd against Kerensky as being the Tsarist regime. Kerensky's failure to assume authority over troops was described by John Reed as a \"fatal blunder\" that signaled the final end of his government. Over the following days, the battle against the anti-Bolsheviks continued. The Red Guard fought against cossacks at Tsarskoye Selo, with the cossacks breaking rank and fleeing, leaving their artillery behind. On 31 October 1917 (13 November, N.S), the Bolsheviks gained control of Moscow after a week of bitter street-fighting. Artillery had been freely used, with an estimated 700 casualties. However, there was continued support for Kerensky in some of the provinces.\nAfter the fall of Moscow, there was only minor public anti-Bolshevik sentiment, such as the newspaper Novaya Zhizn, which criticized the Bolsheviks' lack of manpower and organization in running their party, let alone a government. Lenin confidently claimed that there is \"not a shadow of hesitation in the masses of Petrograd, Moscow and the rest of Russia\" in accepting Bolshevik rule.\n\n\n=== Governmental reforms ===\nOn 10 November 1917 (23 November, N.S.), the government applied the term \"citizens of the Russian Republic\" to Russians, whom they sought to make equal in all possible respects, by the nullification of all \"legal designations of civil inequality, such as estates, titles, and ranks.\"On 12 November (25 November, N.S.), a Constituent Assembly was elected. In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee, and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries. The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets.\nOn 16 December 1917 (29 December, N.S.), the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, removing all titles, ranks, and uniform decorations. The tradition of saluting was also eliminated.On 20 December 1917 (2 January 1918, N.S.), the Cheka was created by Lenin's decree. These were the beginnings of the Bolsheviks' consolidation of power over their political opponents. The Red Terror began in September 1918, following a failed assassination attempt on Lenin. The French Jacobin Terror was an example for the Soviet Bolsheviks. Trotsky had compared Lenin to Maximilien Robespierre as early as 1904.The Decree on Land ratified the actions of the peasants who throughout Russia had taken private land and redistributed it among themselves. The Bolsheviks viewed themselves as representing an alliance of workers and peasants signified by the Hammer and Sickle on the flag and the coat of arms of the Soviet Union.\nOther decrees:\n\nAll private property was nationalized by the government.\nAll Russian banks were nationalized.\nPrivate bank accounts were expropriated.\nThe properties of the Church (including bank accounts) were expropriated.\nAll foreign debts were repudiated.\nControl of the factories was given to the soviets.\nWages were fixed at higher rates than during the war, and a shorter, eight-hour working day was introduced.Not all private property was nationalized by the government in the days, weeks, and months that followed the revolution of 25 October. The government of the Bolshevik party and Left SR did not support the workers taking over large corporations and collectively organizing the economy. As chairman of the government, Lenin negotiated with factions of the upper bourgeoisie, so that the bourgeoisie would manage the corporations according to orders from the new government. This failed utterly, because it presupposed the masses would accept class cooperation in a revolutionary situation. In this context, the Bolshevik party understood \"workers' control\" as checking and supervision by the employees to ensure that orders from the government were followed. Some factories continued in private hands because the masses either had no managerial competence or they hesitated to support the Bolshevik party. Other factories were taken over by the employees and some by the government, after pressure from below or by governmental initiative. There was a lack of class consciousness of the masses who put their hands in an authoritarian political party. Only a minority of the working-class population fought to establish a democratic rule over the main capitalist factories.\n\n\n=== Dictatorial approach ===\nThe Bolshevik party opposed the masses ruling the economy from below as it opposed political institutions being ruled from below. Through democratic elections to the soviets in autumn 1917, the Bolshevik party built its power to control the trade unions which became state institutions. Later the same year, the factory committees were subordinated to the trade unions. From this base it was not difficult to establish one-man-rule over the factories. One administrative and one technical manager had daily control, the technical manager having the last word relating to the economy, independent of what the employees wanted, based on orders from higher ups in the state. The system of one-man-management was fiercely defended by Lenin at a trade union congress in spring 1918, where he said that if the party is not in charge the whole point of a party ceased to exist and thereby the revolution itself would cease.A system of appointment from above was established step by step. Local soviets resisting this policy were either met with armed Cheka troops and forced to submit, or the soviets were denied access to ration cards for food and fuel. The Bolshevik party blocked democratic elections to the soviets, factory committees, the trade unions, and other institutions, which made this transfer of power easier.The October Revolution enabled a political revolution by taking down the old regime but failed to establish a democratic system. That the economy was not transferred to the masses reflected what happened in the political institutions. The political elite saw itself as crucial to world revolution but blocked power being exerted from below. When that same elite also got control of the economy, answering only it transformed itself into a ruling state capitalist class. Later the Bolshevik party went further by placing the working class under martial law to force obedience \u2013 Sovnarkom. This development led to a totalitarian state where Joseph Stalin had even greater power than Lenin and Trotsky.\n\n\n== Timeline of the spread of Soviet power (Gregorian calendar dates) ==\n\n\n== Russian Civil War ==\n\nBolshevik-led attempts to gain power in other parts of the Russian Empire were largely successful in Russia proper\u2014although the fighting in Moscow lasted for two weeks\u2014but they were less successful in ethnically non-Russian parts of the Empire, which had been clamoring for independence since the February Revolution. For example, the Ukrainian Rada, which had declared autonomy on 23 June 1917, created the Ukrainian People's Republic on 20 November, which was supported by the Ukrainian Congress of Soviets. This led to an armed conflict with the Bolshevik government in Petrograd and, eventually, a Ukrainian declaration of independence from Russia on 25 January 1918. In Estonia, two rival governments emerged: the Estonian Provincial Assembly, established in April 1917, proclaimed itself the supreme legal authority of Estonia on 28 November 1917 and issued the Declaration of Independence on 24 February 1918; but Soviet Russia recognized the Executive Committee of the Soviets of Estonia as the legal authority in the province, although the Soviets in Estonia controlled only the capital and a few other major towns.After the success of the October Revolution transformed the Russian state into a soviet republic, a coalition of anti-Bolshevik groups attempted to unseat the new government in the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1922. In an attempt to intervene in the civil war after the Bolsheviks' separate peace with the Central Powers, the Ailied Powers (United Kingdom, France, Italy, United States, and Japan) occupied parts of the Soviet Union for over two years before finally withdrawing. The United States did not recognize the new Russian government until 1933. The European powers recognized the Soviet Union in the early 1920s and began to engage in business with it after the New Economic Policy (NEP) was implemented.\n\n\n== Historiography ==\nHistorical research into few events has been as influenced by the researcher's political outlook as that of the October Revolution. The historiography of the Revolution generally divides into three camps: Soviet-Marxist, Western-Totalitarian, and Revisionist.\n\n\n=== Soviet historiography ===\nSoviet historiography of the October Revolution is intertwined with Soviet historical development. Many of the initial Soviet interpreters of the Revolution were themselves Bolshevik revolutionaries. After the initial wave of revolutionary narratives, Soviet historians worked within \"narrow guidelines\" defined by the Soviet government. The rigidity of interpretive possibilities reached its height under Stalin.Soviet historians of the Revolution interpreted the October Revolution as being about establishing the legitimacy of Marxist ideology and the Bolshevik government. To establish the accuracy of Marxist ideology, Soviet historians generally described the Revolution as the product of class struggle and that it was the supreme event in a world history governed by historical laws. The Bolshevik Party is placed at the center of the Revolution, as it exposes the errors of both the moderate Provisional Government and the spurious \"socialist\" Mensheviks in the Petrograd Soviet. Guided by Lenin's leadership and his firm grasp of scientific Marxist theory, the Party led the \"logically predetermined\" events of the October Revolution from beginning to end. The events were, according to these historians, logically predetermined because of the socio-economic development of Russia, where monopolistic industrial capitalism had alienated the masses. In this view, the Bolshevik party took the leading role in organizing these alienated industrial workers, and thereby established the construction of the first socialist state.Although Soviet historiography of the October Revolution stayed relatively constant until 1991, it did undergo some changes. Following Stalin's death, historians such as E. N. Burdzhalov and P. V. Volobuev published historical research that deviated significantly from the party line in refining the doctrine that the Bolshevik victory \"was predetermined by the state of Russia's socio-economic development\". These historians, who constituted the \"New Directions Group\", posited that the complex nature of the October Revolution \"could only be explained by a multi-causal analysis, not by recourse to the mono-causality of monopoly capitalism\". For them, the central actor is still the Bolshevik party, but this party triumphed \"because it alone could solve the preponderance of 'general democratic' tasks the country faced\" (such as the struggle for peace and the exploitation of landlords).During the late Soviet period, the opening of select Soviet archives during glasnost sparked innovative research that broke away from some aspects of Marxism\u2013Leninism, though the key features of the orthodox Soviet view remained intact.Following the turn of the 21st century, some Soviet historians began to implement an \"anthropological turn\" in their historiographical analysis of the Russian Revolution. This method of analysis focuses on the average person's experience of day-to-day life during the revolution, and pulls the analytical focus away from larger events, notable revolutionaries, and overarching claims about party views. In 2006, S. V. Iarov employed this methodology when he focused on citizen adjustment to the new Soviet system. Iarov explored the dwindling labor protests, evolving forms of debate, and varying forms of politicization as a result of the new Soviet rule from 1917 to 1920. In 2010, O. S. Nagornaia took interest in the personal experiences of Russian prisoners-of-war taken by Germany, examining Russian soldiers and officers' ability to cooperate and implement varying degrees of autocracy despite being divided by class, political views, and race. Other analyses following this \"anthropological turn\" have explored texts from soldiers and how they used personal war-experiences to further their political goals, as well as how individual life-structure and psychology may have shaped major decisions in the civil war that followed the revolution.\n\n\n=== Western historiography ===\nDuring the Cold War, Western historiography of the October Revolution developed in direct response to the assertions of the Soviet view. As a result, Western historians exposed what they believed were flaws in the Soviet view, thereby undermining the Bolsheviks' original legitimacy, as well as the precepts of Marxism.These Western historians described the revolution as the result of a chain of contingent accidents. Examples of these accidental and contingent factors they say precipitated the Revolution included World War I's timing, chance, and the poor leadership of Tsar Nicholas II as well as that of liberal and moderate socialists. According to Western historians, it was not popular support, but rather a manipulation of the masses, ruthlessness, and the party discipline of the Bolsheviks that enabled their triumph. For these historians, the Bolsheviks' defeat in the Constituent Assembly elections of November\u2013December 1917 demonstrated popular opposition to the Bolsheviks' coup, as did the scale and breadth of the Civil War.Western historians saw the organization of the Bolshevik party as proto-totalitarian. Their interpretation of the October Revolution as a violent coup organized by a proto-totalitarian party reinforced for them the idea that totalitarianism was an inherent part of Soviet history. The democratic promise of the February Revolution came to an end with the forced dissolution of the Constituent Assembly. Thus, Stalinist totalitarianism developed as a natural progression from Leninism and the Bolshevik party's tactics and organization.\n\n\n=== Effect of the dissolution of the Soviet Union on historical research ===\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union affected historical interpretations of the October Revolution. Since 1991, increasing access to large amounts of Soviet archival materials has made it possible to re\u2011examine the October Revolution. Though both Western and Russian historians now have access to many of these archives, the effect of the dissolution of the USSR can be seen most clearly in the work of the latter. While the disintegration essentially helped solidify the Western and Revisionist views, post-USSR Russian historians largely repudiated the former Soviet historical interpretation of the Revolution. As Stephen Kotkin argues, 1991 prompted \"a return to political history and the apparent resurrection of totalitarianism, the interpretive view that, in different ways\u2026revisionists sought to bury\".\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nThe October Revolution marks the inception of the first communist government in Russia, and thus the first large-scale socialist state in world history. After this, Russia became the Russian SFSR and, later, part of the USSR, which dissolved in late 1991.\nThe October Revolution also made the ideology of communism influential on a global scale in the 20th century. Communist parties would start to form in certain countries after 1917.\nTen Days That Shook the World, a book written by American journalist John Reed and first published in 1919, gives a firsthand exposition of the events. Reed died in 1920, shortly after the book was finished.\nDmitri Shostakovich wrote his Symphony No. 2 in B major, Op. 14, and subtitled it To October, for the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution. The choral finale of the work, \"To October\", is set to a text by Alexander Bezymensky, which praises Lenin and the revolution. The Symphony No. 2 was first performed on 5 November 1927 by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra and the Academy Capella Choir under the direction of Nikolai Malko.\nSergei Eisenstein and Grigori Aleksandrov's film October: Ten Days That Shook the World, first released on 20 January 1928 in the USSR and on 2 November 1928 in New York City, describes and glorifies the revolution, having been commissioned to commemorate the event.\nThe term \"Red October\" (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c, Krasnyy Oktyabr) has been used to signify the October Revolution. \"Red October\" was given to a steel factory that was made notable by the Battle of Stalingrad, a Moscow sweets factory that is well known in Russia, and a fictional Soviet submarine.\n7 November, the anniversary of the October Revolution according to the Gregorian Calendar, was the official national day of the Soviet Union from 1918 onward and still is a public holiday in Belarus and the breakaway territory of Transnistria.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFebruary Revolution\nTen Days That Shook the World\nRevolutions of 1917\u20131923\nRussian Civil War\nRussian Revolution (1917)\nKiev Bolshevik Uprising\nDissolution of the Soviet Union (1991)\nOctober Revolution Day\nIndex of articles related to the Russian Revolution and Civil War\nBibliography of the Russian Revolution and Civil War\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRead, Christopher: Revolutions (Russian Empire), in: 1914-1918-online.

        "wiki": "Minsk (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a [m\u02b2insk], Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) is the capital and largest city of Belarus, located on the Svisla\u010d and the Nyamiha Rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom. A good example is St. Elisabeth's Convent, founded in 1999.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nKalvaryja (Calvary Cemetery) is the oldest surviving cemetery in the city. Many famous people of Belarus are buried here. The cemetery was closed to new burials in the 1960s.\nMilitary Cemetery\nEastern Cemetery\n\u010cy\u017eo\u016dskija Cemetery\nNorthern Cemetery\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nMajor theatres are:\n\nNational Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus \nBelarusian State Musical Theatre (performances in Russian)\nMaxim Gorky National Drama Theatre (performances in Russian)\nYanka Kupala National Drama Theatre (performances in Belarusian)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nMajor museums include:\n\nBelarusian National Arts Museum\nBelarusian Great Patriotic War Museum\nBelarusian National History and Culture Museum\nBelarusian Nature and Environment Museum\nMaksim Bahdanovi\u010d Literary Museum\nOld Belarusian History Museum\nYanka Kupala Literary MuseumArt galleries include:\n\n\u040e gallery\n\n\n=== Recreation areas ===\nChelyuskinites Park\nChildren's Railroad\nGorky Park (Minsk)\nYanka Kupala Park\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are more than 400 travel agencies in Minsk, about a quarter of them provide agent activity, and most of them are tour operators.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\nFC Dinamo Minsk\nFC Minsk\nFC Torpedo Minsk\nFC Energetik-BGU Minsk\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nHC Dinamo Minsk\nHC Yunost Minsk\n\n\n=== Handball ===\nSKA Minsk\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nBC Tsmoki-Minsk\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\nIn 2013, Minsk hosted the European Junior Rowing Championships at the Republican Center of Olympic Training for Rowing And Canoeing to the north-west of the city.Minsk hosted the 2014 IIHF World Championship at the Minsk Arena.\nIn January 2016, the 2016 European Speed Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena. Minsk Arena is the only indoor speed skating rink in Belarus.\nOn 21 October 2016, it was confirmed by the European Olympic Committee that Minsk will host the 2019 European Games.\nThe 2019 European Figure Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena from the 21st to 27 January.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nMinsk has an extensive public transport system. Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, Smolensk, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nAccording to the survey in 2019 (were interviewed 1934 people), in Minsk around 811 thousand of adult bicycles plus 232 thousand of child and adolescent bicycles.

        "wiki": "The Trinity Hill is the oldest surviving district of Minsk; in the past it was not part of the downtown, rather a suburb, hence another name, Trinity Suburb (Trajeckaje pradmiescie). The historic neighbourhood sprawls along the left bank of the Svislach River in the southeastern part of the modern city. The Belarusian 5-ruble bill featured an image of Trinity Suburb.\nThere are several hypotheses about the name. The most common relates it to the first Roman Catholic church in  Minsk, the Trinity and Assumption of Mary Church, which was, according to a legend, founded by W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o. Another suggestion is Trinity Convent, of which little remains. \nThe Trinity and Assumption church, Trinity Convent, the Ascension Monastery, the church of Sts. Boris and Gleb, and a synagogue whiche existed there, have disappeared. Today it is an area of 19th-century housing, mostly restored after the ravages of World War II. Modern buildings include the national opera and ballet theatre and the Island of Tears memorial. \n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Trajeckaje pradmiescie at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Minsk (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a [m\u02b2insk], Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) is the capital and largest city of Belarus, located on the Svisla\u010d and the Nyamiha Rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom. A good example is St. Elisabeth's Convent, founded in 1999.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nKalvaryja (Calvary Cemetery) is the oldest surviving cemetery in the city. Many famous people of Belarus are buried here. The cemetery was closed to new burials in the 1960s.\nMilitary Cemetery\nEastern Cemetery\n\u010cy\u017eo\u016dskija Cemetery\nNorthern Cemetery\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nMajor theatres are:\n\nNational Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus \nBelarusian State Musical Theatre (performances in Russian)\nMaxim Gorky National Drama Theatre (performances in Russian)\nYanka Kupala National Drama Theatre (performances in Belarusian)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nMajor museums include:\n\nBelarusian National Arts Museum\nBelarusian Great Patriotic War Museum\nBelarusian National History and Culture Museum\nBelarusian Nature and Environment Museum\nMaksim Bahdanovi\u010d Literary Museum\nOld Belarusian History Museum\nYanka Kupala Literary MuseumArt galleries include:\n\n\u040e gallery\n\n\n=== Recreation areas ===\nChelyuskinites Park\nChildren's Railroad\nGorky Park (Minsk)\nYanka Kupala Park\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are more than 400 travel agencies in Minsk, about a quarter of them provide agent activity, and most of them are tour operators.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\nFC Dinamo Minsk\nFC Minsk\nFC Torpedo Minsk\nFC Energetik-BGU Minsk\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nHC Dinamo Minsk\nHC Yunost Minsk\n\n\n=== Handball ===\nSKA Minsk\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nBC Tsmoki-Minsk\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\nIn 2013, Minsk hosted the European Junior Rowing Championships at the Republican Center of Olympic Training for Rowing And Canoeing to the north-west of the city.Minsk hosted the 2014 IIHF World Championship at the Minsk Arena.\nIn January 2016, the 2016 European Speed Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena. Minsk Arena is the only indoor speed skating rink in Belarus.\nOn 21 October 2016, it was confirmed by the European Olympic Committee that Minsk will host the 2019 European Games.\nThe 2019 European Figure Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena from the 21st to 27 January.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nMinsk has an extensive public transport system. Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, Smolensk, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nAccording to the survey in 2019 (were interviewed 1934 people), in Minsk around 811 thousand of adult bicycles plus 232 thousand of child and adolescent bicycles. In Minsk one bike is for 1.9 people. The total number of bicycles in Minsk exceeds the total number of Cars (770 thousand of personal automobiles). 39% of Minsk residents have a personal bike. 43% of Minsk residents ride a bicycle once a month or more. As of 2017, the level of bicycle use is about 1% of all transport movements (for comparison: 12% in Berlin, 50% in Copenhagen).\n\nSince 2015, a bicycle parade / bicycle carnival held in Minsk, during which vehicles are blocked for several hours along Pobediteley (Peramohi) Avenue (one of the main streets of Minsk). The number of participants in 2019 was more than 20 thousand, the number of registrations was about 12 thousand.In 2017, the European Union funded the project \"Urban cycling in Belarus\" in the amount of 560 thousand euros, within the framework of which the public association Minsk Cycling Society together with the Council of Ministers created the regulatory document National Concept for the Development of Cycling in Belarus.\n\nSince 2013, a free public workshop \"Bicycle Kitchen Garage 38\" has been operating in Minsk, where everyone can use the tool and help repairing the bicycle. Free bike school works.In 2020, Minsk entered the top 3 most cycling cities in the CIS \u2013 after Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nMinsk National Airport is located 42 km (26 mi) to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current railway station opened in 1987. It is an international airport with flights to Europe and the Middle East.Minsk-1 opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1 million passengers a year.From 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, Kiev and Kaliningrad. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as Minsk-City.Minsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is located in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges, and 29 higher education institutions, including 12 major national universities.\n\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\nAcademy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

        "wiki": "Minsk (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a [m\u02b2insk], Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) is the capital and largest city of Belarus, located on the Svisla\u010d and the Nyamiha Rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom. A good example is St. Elisabeth's Convent, founded in 1999.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nKalvaryja (Calvary Cemetery) is the oldest surviving cemetery in the city. Many famous people of Belarus are buried here. The cemetery was closed to new burials in the 1960s.\nMilitary Cemetery\nEastern Cemetery\n\u010cy\u017eo\u016dskija Cemetery\nNorthern Cemetery\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nMajor theatres are:\n\nNational Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus \nBelarusian State Musical Theatre (performances in Russian)\nMaxim Gorky National Drama Theatre (performances in Russian)\nYanka Kupala National Drama Theatre (performances in Belarusian)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nMajor museums include:\n\nBelarusian National Arts Museum\nBelarusian Great Patriotic War Museum\nBelarusian National History and Culture Museum\nBelarusian Nature and Environment Museum\nMaksim Bahdanovi\u010d Literary Museum\nOld Belarusian History Museum\nYanka Kupala Literary MuseumArt galleries include:\n\n\u040e gallery\n\n\n=== Recreation areas ===\nChelyuskinites Park\nChildren's Railroad\nGorky Park (Minsk)\nYanka Kupala Park\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are more than 400 travel agencies in Minsk, about a quarter of them provide agent activity, and most of them are tour operators.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\nFC Dinamo Minsk\nFC Minsk\nFC Torpedo Minsk\nFC Energetik-BGU Minsk\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nHC Dinamo Minsk\nHC Yunost Minsk\n\n\n=== Handball ===\nSKA Minsk\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nBC Tsmoki-Minsk\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\nIn 2013, Minsk hosted the European Junior Rowing Championships at the Republican Center of Olympic Training for Rowing And Canoeing to the north-west of the city.Minsk hosted the 2014 IIHF World Championship at the Minsk Arena.\nIn January 2016, the 2016 European Speed Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena. Minsk Arena is the only indoor speed skating rink in Belarus.\nOn 21 October 2016, it was confirmed by the European Olympic Committee that Minsk will host the 2019 European Games.\nThe 2019 European Figure Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena from the 21st to 27 January.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nMinsk has an extensive public transport system. Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, Smolensk, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nAccording to the survey in 2019 (were interviewed 1934 people), in Minsk around 811 thousand of adult bicycles plus 232 thousand of child and adolescent bicycles. In Minsk one bike is for 1.9 people. The total number of bicycles in Minsk exceeds the total number of Cars (770 thousand of personal automobiles). 39% of Minsk residents have a personal bike. 43% of Minsk residents ride a bicycle once a month or more. As of 2017, the level of bicycle use is about 1% of all transport movements (for comparison: 12% in Berlin, 50% in Copenhagen).\n\nSince 2015, a bicycle parade / bicycle carnival held in Minsk, during which vehicles are blocked for several hours along Pobediteley (Peramohi) Avenue (one of the main streets of Minsk). The number of participants in 2019 was more than 20 thousand, the number of registrations was about 12 thousand.In 2017, the European Union funded the project \"Urban cycling in Belarus\" in the amount of 560 thousand euros, within the framework of which the public association Minsk Cycling Society together with the Council of Ministers created the regulatory document National Concept for the Development of Cycling in Belarus.\n\nSince 2013, a free public workshop \"Bicycle Kitchen Garage 38\" has been operating in Minsk, where everyone can use the tool and help repairing the bicycle. Free bike school works.In 2020, Minsk entered the top 3 most cycling cities in the CIS \u2013 after Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nMinsk National Airport is located 42 km (26 mi) to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current railway station opened in 1987. It is an international airport with flights to Europe and the Middle East.Minsk-1 opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1 million passengers a year.From 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, Kiev and Kaliningrad. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as Minsk-City.Minsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is located in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges, and 29 higher education institutions, including 12 major national universities.\n\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\nAcademy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus. The Academy was established in 1991 and it acquired the status of a presidential institution in 1995. In structure of Academy 3 institutes: Institute of Administrative Personnel has 3 departments, Institute of Civil Service has also 3 departments and Research Institute of the Theory and Practice of Public administration.\nBelarusian State University. Major Belarusian universal university, founded in 1921. In 2006 had 15 major departments (Applied Mathematics and Informatics; Biology; Chemistry; Geography; Economics; International relations; Journalism; History; Humanitarian Sciences; Law; Mechanics and Mathematics; Philology; Philosophy and Social sciences; Physics; Radiophysics and Electronics). It also included 5 R&D institutes, 24 Research Centres, 114 R&D laboratories. The University employs over 2,400 lecturers and 1,000 research fellows; 1,900 of these hold PhD or Dr. Sc. degrees.

        "wiki": "Minsk (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a [m\u02b2insk], Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) is the capital and largest city of Belarus, located on the Svisla\u010d and the Nyamiha Rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom. A good example is St. Elisabeth's Convent, founded in 1999.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nKalvaryja (Calvary Cemetery) is the oldest surviving cemetery in the city. Many famous people of Belarus are buried here. The cemetery was closed to new burials in the 1960s.\nMilitary Cemetery\nEastern Cemetery\n\u010cy\u017eo\u016dskija Cemetery\nNorthern Cemetery\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nMajor theatres are:\n\nNational Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus \nBelarusian State Musical Theatre (performances in Russian)\nMaxim Gorky National Drama Theatre (performances in Russian)\nYanka Kupala National Drama Theatre (performances in Belarusian)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nMajor museums include:\n\nBelarusian National Arts Museum\nBelarusian Great Patriotic War Museum\nBelarusian National History and Culture Museum\nBelarusian Nature and Environment Museum\nMaksim Bahdanovi\u010d Literary Museum\nOld Belarusian History Museum\nYanka Kupala Literary MuseumArt galleries include:\n\n\u040e gallery\n\n\n=== Recreation areas ===\nChelyuskinites Park\nChildren's Railroad\nGorky Park (Minsk)\nYanka Kupala Park\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are more than 400 travel agencies in Minsk, about a quarter of them provide agent activity, and most of them are tour operators.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\nFC Dinamo Minsk\nFC Minsk\nFC Torpedo Minsk\nFC Energetik-BGU Minsk\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nHC Dinamo Minsk\nHC Yunost Minsk\n\n\n=== Handball ===\nSKA Minsk\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nBC Tsmoki-Minsk\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\nIn 2013, Minsk hosted the European Junior Rowing Championships at the Republican Center of Olympic Training for Rowing And Canoeing to the north-west of the city.Minsk hosted the 2014 IIHF World Championship at the Minsk Arena.\nIn January 2016, the 2016 European Speed Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena. Minsk Arena is the only indoor speed skating rink in Belarus.\nOn 21 October 2016, it was confirmed by the European Olympic Committee that Minsk will host the 2019 European Games.\nThe 2019 European Figure Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena from the 21st to 27 January.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nMinsk has an extensive public transport system. Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, Smolensk, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nAccording to the survey in 2019 (were interviewed 1934 people), in Minsk around 811 thousand of adult bicycles plus 232 thousand of child and adolescent bicycles. In Minsk one bike is for 1.9 people. The total number of bicycles in Minsk exceeds the total number of Cars (770 thousand of personal automobiles). 39% of Minsk residents have a personal bike. 43% of Minsk residents ride a bicycle once a month or more. As of 2017, the level of bicycle use is about 1% of all transport movements (for comparison: 12% in Berlin, 50% in Copenhagen).\n\nSince 2015, a bicycle parade / bicycle carnival held in Minsk, during which vehicles are blocked for several hours along Pobediteley (Peramohi) Avenue (one of the main streets of Minsk). The number of participants in 2019 was more than 20 thousand, the number of registrations was about 12 thousand.In 2017, the European Union funded the project \"Urban cycling in Belarus\" in the amount of 560 thousand euros, within the framework of which the public association Minsk Cycling Society together with the Council of Ministers created the regulatory document National Concept for the Development of Cycling in Belarus.\n\nSince 2013, a free public workshop \"Bicycle Kitchen Garage 38\" has been operating in Minsk, where everyone can use the tool and help repairing the bicycle. Free bike school works.In 2020, Minsk entered the top 3 most cycling cities in the CIS \u2013 after Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nMinsk National Airport is located 42 km (26 mi) to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current railway station opened in 1987. It is an international airport with flights to Europe and the Middle East.Minsk-1 opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1 million passengers a year.From 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, Kiev and Kaliningrad. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as Minsk-City.Minsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is located in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges, and 29 higher education institutions, including 12 major national universities.\n\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\nAcademy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

        "wiki": "Minsk (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a [m\u02b2insk], Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) is the capital and largest city of Belarus, located on the Svisla\u010d and the Nyamiha Rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom. A good example is St. Elisabeth's Convent, founded in 1999.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nKalvaryja (Calvary Cemetery) is the oldest surviving cemetery in the city. Many famous people of Belarus are buried here. The cemetery was closed to new burials in the 1960s.\nMilitary Cemetery\nEastern Cemetery\n\u010cy\u017eo\u016dskija Cemetery\nNorthern Cemetery\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nMajor theatres are:\n\nNational Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus \nBelarusian State Musical Theatre (performances in Russian)\nMaxim Gorky National Drama Theatre (performances in Russian)\nYanka Kupala National Drama Theatre (performances in Belarusian)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nMajor museums include:\n\nBelarusian National Arts Museum\nBelarusian Great Patriotic War Museum\nBelarusian National History and Culture Museum\nBelarusian Nature and Environment Museum\nMaksim Bahdanovi\u010d Literary Museum\nOld Belarusian History Museum\nYanka Kupala Literary MuseumArt galleries include:\n\n\u040e gallery\n\n\n=== Recreation areas ===\nChelyuskinites Park\nChildren's Railroad\nGorky Park (Minsk)\nYanka Kupala Park\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are more than 400 travel agencies in Minsk, about a quarter of them provide agent activity, and most of them are tour operators.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\nFC Dinamo Minsk\nFC Minsk\nFC Torpedo Minsk\nFC Energetik-BGU Minsk\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nHC Dinamo Minsk\nHC Yunost Minsk\n\n\n=== Handball ===\nSKA Minsk\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nBC Tsmoki-Minsk\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\nIn 2013, Minsk hosted the European Junior Rowing Championships at the Republican Center of Olympic Training for Rowing And Canoeing to the north-west of the city.Minsk hosted the 2014 IIHF World Championship at the Minsk Arena.\nIn January 2016, the 2016 European Speed Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena. Minsk Arena is the only indoor speed skating rink in Belarus.\nOn 21 October 2016, it was confirmed by the European Olympic Committee that Minsk will host the 2019 European Games.\nThe 2019 European Figure Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena from the 21st to 27 January.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nMinsk has an extensive public transport system. Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, Smolensk, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nAccording to the survey in 2019 (were interviewed 1934 people), in Minsk around 811 thousand of adult bicycles plus 232 thousand of child and adolescent bicycles. In Minsk one bike is for 1.9 people. The total number of bicycles in Minsk exceeds the total number of Cars (770 thousand of personal automobiles). 39% of Minsk residents have a personal bike. 43% of Minsk residents ride a bicycle once a month or more. As of 2017, the level of bicycle use is about 1% of all transport movements (for comparison: 12% in Berlin, 50% in Copenhagen).\n\nSince 2015, a bicycle parade / bicycle carnival held in Minsk, during which vehicles are blocked for several hours along Pobediteley (Peramohi) Avenue (one of the main streets of Minsk). The number of participants in 2019 was more than 20 thousand, the number of registrations was about 12 thousand.In 2017, the European Union funded the project \"Urban cycling in Belarus\" in the amount of 560 thousand euros, within the framework of which the public association Minsk Cycling Society together with the Council of Ministers created the regulatory document National Concept for the Development of Cycling in Belarus.\n\nSince 2013, a free public workshop \"Bicycle Kitchen Garage 38\" has been operating in Minsk, where everyone can use the tool and help repairing the bicycle. Free bike school works.In 2020, Minsk entered the top 3 most cycling cities in the CIS \u2013 after Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nMinsk National Airport is located 42 km (26 mi) to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current railway station opened in 1987. It is an international airport with flights to Europe and the Middle East.Minsk-1 opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1 million passengers a year.From 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, Kiev and Kaliningrad. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as Minsk-City.Minsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is located in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges, and 29 higher education institutions, including 12 major national universities.\n\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\nAcademy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

        "wiki": "Minsk (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a [m\u02b2insk], Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) is the capital and largest city of Belarus, located on the Svisla\u010d and the Nyamiha Rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom. A good example is St. Elisabeth's Convent, founded in 1999.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nKalvaryja (Calvary Cemetery) is the oldest surviving cemetery in the city. Many famous people of Belarus are buried here. The cemetery was closed to new burials in the 1960s.\nMilitary Cemetery\nEastern Cemetery\n\u010cy\u017eo\u016dskija Cemetery\nNorthern Cemetery\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nMajor theatres are:\n\nNational Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus \nBelarusian State Musical Theatre (performances in Russian)\nMaxim Gorky National Drama Theatre (performances in Russian)\nYanka Kupala National Drama Theatre (performances in Belarusian)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nMajor museums include:\n\nBelarusian National Arts Museum\nBelarusian Great Patriotic War Museum\nBelarusian National History and Culture Museum\nBelarusian Nature and Environment Museum\nMaksim Bahdanovi\u010d Literary Museum\nOld Belarusian History Museum\nYanka Kupala Literary MuseumArt galleries include:\n\n\u040e gallery\n\n\n=== Recreation areas ===\nChelyuskinites Park\nChildren's Railroad\nGorky Park (Minsk)\nYanka Kupala Park\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are more than 400 travel agencies in Minsk, about a quarter of them provide agent activity, and most of them are tour operators.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\nFC Dinamo Minsk\nFC Minsk\nFC Torpedo Minsk\nFC Energetik-BGU Minsk\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nHC Dinamo Minsk\nHC Yunost Minsk\n\n\n=== Handball ===\nSKA Minsk\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nBC Tsmoki-Minsk\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\nIn 2013, Minsk hosted the European Junior Rowing Championships at the Republican Center of Olympic Training for Rowing And Canoeing to the north-west of the city.Minsk hosted the 2014 IIHF World Championship at the Minsk Arena.\nIn January 2016, the 2016 European Speed Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena. Minsk Arena is the only indoor speed skating rink in Belarus.\nOn 21 October 2016, it was confirmed by the European Olympic Committee that Minsk will host the 2019 European Games.\nThe 2019 European Figure Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena from the 21st to 27 January.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nMinsk has an extensive public transport system. Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries.

        "wiki": "The Minsk Ghetto was created soon after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It was one of the largest in Belorussian SSR, and the largest in the German-occupied territory of the Soviet Union. It housed close to 100,000 Jews, most of whom perished in The Holocaust.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Soviet census of 1926 showed 53,700 Jews living in Minsk (constituting close to 41% of the city's inhabitants).The ghetto was created soon after the German invasion of the Soviet Union and capture of the city of Minsk, capital of the Belorussian SSR, on 28 June 1941. On the fifth day after the occupation, 2,000 Jewish intelligentsia were massacred by the Germans; from then on, murders of Jews became a common occurrence. About 20,000 Jews were murdered within the first few months of the German occupation, mostly by the Einsatzgruppen squads.On 17 July 1941 the German occupational authority, the Reichskommissariat Ostland, was created. On 20 July, the Minsk Ghetto was established. A Jewish Council (Judenrat) was established as well. The total population of the ghetto was about 80,000 (over 100,000 according to some sources), of which about 50,000 were pre-war inhabitants, and the remainder (30,000 or more) were refugees and Jews forcibly resettled by the Germans from nearby settlements.\n\nIn November 1941 a second ghetto was established in Minsk for Jews deported from the West, known as Ghetto Hamburg, which adjoined the main Minsk ghetto. Above the entrance to this separate ghetto was a sign: Sonderghetto (Special Ghetto). Every night the Gestapo would murder 70\u201380 of the new arrivals. This ghetto was divided into five sections, according to the places from which the inhabitants came: Hamburg, Frankfurt, Berlin, the Rhineland, Bremen, and Vienna. Most of the Jews in this ghetto were from Germany and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia; at its height it had about 35,000 residents. Little contact was permitted between the inhabitants of the two ghettos.\n\nAs in many other ghettos, Jews were forced to work in factories or other German-run operations. Ghetto inhabitants lived in extremely poor conditions, with insufficient stocks of food and medical supplies.\nOn 2 March 1942,  the ghetto's nursery or orphanage was \"liquidated\"; the children were buried alive in a pit after the murderers had tossed them candy: At that moment, several SS officers, among them Wilhelm Kube, arrived, whereupon Kube, immaculate in his uniform, threw handfuls of sweets to the shrieking children.  All the children perished in the sand. In March 1942, approximately 5,000 Jews were killed nearby where \"The Pit\" memorial to the Minsk ghetto now stands. On 31 March, the Germans raided the ghetto to arrest Resistance leaders and much of the ghetto, including the synagogue, was burned.By August fewer than 9,000 Jews were left in the ghetto according to German official documents. The ghetto was liquidated on 21 October 1943, with many Minsk Jews perishing in the Sobibor extermination camp. Several thousand were massacred at Maly Trostenets extermination camp (before the war, Maly Trostenets was a village a few miles to the east of Minsk). By the time the Red Army retook the city on 3 July 1944, there were only a few Jewish survivors.\n\n\n== Resistance ==\n\nThe Minsk Ghetto is notable for its large scale resistance organization, which cooperated closely with Soviet partisans. About 10,000 Jews were able to escape the ghetto and join  partisan groups in the nearby forests. Barbara Epstein estimates that perhaps half of them survived, and notes that all together, perhaps as many as 30,000 people tried to escape the Minsk Ghetto to join the partisans (but 20,000 of them could have died along the way).\n\n\n== See also ==\nMaly Trostenets extermination camp\nThe Holocaust in Belarus\nJewish ghettos of Europe\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBarbara Epstein, The Minsk Ghetto 1941\u20131943: Jewish Resistance and Soviet Internationalism, University of California Press, 2008, ISBN 978-0-520-24242-5 ([1])\nHersh Smolar, The Minsk Ghetto: Soviet-Jewish Partisans Against the Nazis, Holocaust Library, 1989, ISBN 0-89604-068-2\n\n\n== External links ==\nMap of the Minsk Ghetto at USHMM\nMinsk, Belarus at JewishGen\nMinsk Ghetto Photographs\n1943 Minsk Ghetto List\nPolitical Controversy Marks Anniversary Of Minsk Ghetto's Destruction, Radio Free Europe, October 22, 2008\n'Interviews from the Underground: The Minsk Ghetto Resistance'",

          "This is a must if you wish to understand the Belarusian mindset. Yes - the memorial starts the Unconquered Man statue beside the symbolic roof of the barn. Passing by that you are in the village - each house having the names and ages of the occupants that were murdered. Powerful",
          "The Khatyn Memorial begins with a sculpture of a man holding his dead son. The story of this village is so sad. The villagers were put in a barn and the barn was set on fire. Those who tried to escape the flames were shot. The blacksmith survived because he passed out and bodies",
          "Even in winter when most of the symbolic graves of the villages are covered in snow, it is still a very emotional place and powerful and compelling and blood chilling. That such atrocities were committed is still something that people need to remember and hopefully with such",

The village symbolises all the towns and villages which suffered a similar fate at the hands of the Nazis. 186 cubes, respresent each of the larger",

          "A very interesting place and a great history. Noone will leave without thinking of how it was hard and how the belarussians did it. Every 4 seconds, when the bells ring it touchs everyones heart"

        "wiki": "Natalia Chernogolova is a Belarusian artist.\nShe was born on 15 May 1954 in Zhitkovichi, Gomel Region, USSR (now Belarus). She graduated from the Minsk School of Art in 1976 and went on to study in the Art and Drawing Department of the Pedagogical Institute in Vitebsk, graduating in 1982. In 1989 she was elected to the USSR Union of Artists, undertaking various official commissions.\nNatalia paints without preliminary sketches or drawings. \"Painting is her life. She finds it impossible not to paint. She works with passion and vitality, and her love of life is evident in her work. Natalia has developed a way of painting using only her fingers. This, underpinned by her long classical training, enables her to capture the vigour and spirit that she sees in the subjects she has chosen.\"She first visited the United Kingdom in 2005 when she created many vivid oil paintings of street scenes in Congleton and Cheshire landscapes. Her neo-expressionist paintings appear in collections and galleries in the US, UK, Germany, Belarus, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Australia, Canada and Israel. She lives in Brest, Belarus.\n\n\n== Career summary ==\nThe following short article and interview by London art critic John Thaxter appeared as part of a brochure for her participation in the Landmark Arts Centre art fair and exhibition in Teddington, Greater London, in June 2009; it was written to provide buyers of her work with a brief career summary.\n\"AN outstanding contemporary female artist from Belarus, Natalia Chernogolova is making her third trip to the UK this summer to exhibit, paint, sell her work and make new friends in the art world. 'I live for art', she says. 'I work everywhere - at an exhibition, in the street, on a train, in a theatre. I don't like 'thin' paintings. I always work on a few paintings simultaneously - I experiment all the time. And I rely on intuition.'\n\"Miss Chernogolova studied at the arts faculty of the Vitebsk University, home town of Marc Chagall, graduating in 1982; and like him she once made her gallery entrance on a white horse. As a Russian artist she began as a socialist realist and in 1989 was elected to the USSR Union of Artists. But with perestroika and the break-up of the Soviet Union she became free to express herself more exuberantly and her paintings and drawings can now be found in private collections and public galleries in Belarus, Poland, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the UK, North America, Australia and Israel.\n\"Born in Belarus in May 1954, Natalia arrives directly from Minsk where she has recently enjoyed critical acclaim for her one-woman show of 40 major paintings at the National Gallery: Palace of Art, which attracted more than 6,000 visitors and received national television news coverage.\n\"This is her first time in London and while here she hopes to visit all the principal galleries as well as exhibitions of individual artists. But her first stop is Teddington where she is taking part in the Midsummer Art Exhibition at the Landmark Centre, including the creation of her famous on-the-spot portraits in oils using fingertips instead of paint-brushes. 'Hands are more expressive,' she declares. 'They give me more power to express myself \u2014 they give me a better touch.' \".\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n1976\u20141988 \u2014 Brest, Minsk \u2014 Belarus\n1988 \u2014 Gurzufa \u2014 Crimea\n1989 \u2014 Minsk, Brest \u2014 Belarus\n1990 \u2014 Minsk, Grodno \u2014 Belarus\n1991 \u2014 Na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w \u2014 Poland\n1992 \u2014 Na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w, Katowice, Pu\u0142awy, Go\u0142\u0105b \u2014 Poland; Brest - Belarus; Ostrowiec, Bia\u0142a \u2014 Poland\n1993 \u2014 Zakopane, Krynica, Na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w \u2014 Poland\n1994 \u2014 Na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w \u2014 Poland; Brest \u2014 Belarus\n1995 \u2014 Brest \u2014 Belarus\n1996 \u2014 Zakopane \u2014 Poland\n1997 \u2014 Brest, Minsk \u2014 Belarus\n1998 \u2014 Brest, Minsk \u2014 Belarus\n1999 \u2014 Siedlce \u2014 Poland\n2000 \u2014 Pu\u0142awy \u2014 Poland\n2001 \u2014 Bia\u0142a \u2014 Poland\n2002 \u2014 Pu\u0142awy \u2014 Poland\n2005 \u2014 Brest \u2014 Belarus\n2005 \u2014 Galeria Andre (www.galeriaandre.com) \u2014 Warsaw and worldwide\n2006 \u2014 Manchester Central Library, UK: Colours of Love, 25 July-29 September\n2009 \u2014 National Gallery Palace of Art, Minsk, Belarus\n2009 \u2014 Landmark Arts Centre, Teddington, UK, 19\u201321 June\n2010 \u2014 Todmorden Fine Art, Todmorden, Lancashire, UK, March\n2014 \u2014 Belarusian Palace of Art, Minsk\n\n\n== External links ==\nNatalia Chernogolova official web-site\nNatalia Chernogolova.

        "wiki": "Minsk (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a [m\u02b2insk], Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) is the capital and largest city of Belarus, located on the Svisla\u010d and the Nyamiha Rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom. A good example is St. Elisabeth's Convent, founded in 1999.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nKalvaryja (Calvary Cemetery) is the oldest surviving cemetery in the city. Many famous people of Belarus are buried here. The cemetery was closed to new burials in the 1960s.\nMilitary Cemetery\nEastern Cemetery\n\u010cy\u017eo\u016dskija Cemetery\nNorthern Cemetery\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nMajor theatres are:\n\nNational Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus \nBelarusian State Musical Theatre (performances in Russian)\nMaxim Gorky National Drama Theatre (performances in Russian)\nYanka Kupala National Drama Theatre (performances in Belarusian)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nMajor museums include:\n\nBelarusian National Arts Museum\nBelarusian Great Patriotic War Museum\nBelarusian National History and Culture Museum\nBelarusian Nature and Environment Museum\nMaksim Bahdanovi\u010d Literary Museum\nOld Belarusian History Museum\nYanka Kupala Literary MuseumArt galleries include:\n\n\u040e gallery\n\n\n=== Recreation areas ===\nChelyuskinites Park\nChildren's Railroad\nGorky Park (Minsk)\nYanka Kupala Park\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are more than 400 travel agencies in Minsk, about a quarter of them provide agent activity, and most of them are tour operators.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\nFC Dinamo Minsk\nFC Minsk\nFC Torpedo Minsk\nFC Energetik-BGU Minsk\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nHC Dinamo Minsk\nHC Yunost Minsk\n\n\n=== Handball ===\nSKA Minsk\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nBC Tsmoki-Minsk\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\nIn 2013, Minsk hosted the European Junior Rowing Championships at the Republican Center of Olympic Training for Rowing And Canoeing to the north-west of the city.Minsk hosted the 2014 IIHF World Championship at the Minsk Arena.\nIn January 2016, the 2016 European Speed Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena. Minsk Arena is the only indoor speed skating rink in Belarus.\nOn 21 October 2016, it was confirmed by the European Olympic Committee that Minsk will host the 2019 European Games.\nThe 2019 European Figure Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena from the 21st to 27 January.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nMinsk has an extensive public transport system. Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, Smolensk, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nAccording to the survey in 2019 (were interviewed 1934 people), in Minsk around 811 thousand of adult bicycles plus 232 thousand of child and adolescent bicycles. In Minsk one bike is for 1.9 people. The total number of bicycles in Minsk exceeds the total number of Cars (770 thousand of personal automobiles). 39% of Minsk residents have a personal bike. 43% of Minsk residents ride a bicycle once a month or more. As of 2017, the level of bicycle use is about 1% of all transport movements (for comparison: 12% in Berlin, 50% in Copenhagen).\n\nSince 2015, a bicycle parade / bicycle carnival held in Minsk, during which vehicles are blocked for several hours along Pobediteley (Peramohi) Avenue (one of the main streets of Minsk). The number of participants in 2019 was more than 20 thousand, the number of registrations was about 12 thousand.In 2017, the European Union funded the project \"Urban cycling in Belarus\" in the amount of 560 thousand euros, within the framework of which the public association Minsk Cycling Society together with the Council of Ministers created the regulatory document National Concept for the Development of Cycling in Belarus.\n\nSince 2013, a free public workshop \"Bicycle Kitchen Garage 38\" has been operating in Minsk, where everyone can use the tool and help repairing the bicycle. Free bike school works.In 2020, Minsk entered the top 3 most cycling cities in the CIS \u2013 after Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nMinsk National Airport is located 42 km (26 mi) to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current railway station opened in 1987. It is an international airport with flights to Europe and the Middle East.Minsk-1 opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1 million passengers a year.From 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, Kiev and Kaliningrad. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as Minsk-City.Minsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is located in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges, and 29 higher education institutions, including 12 major national universities.\n\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\nAcademy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

        "wiki": "Minsk (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a [m\u02b2insk], Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) is the capital and largest city of Belarus, located on the Svisla\u010d and the Nyamiha Rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom. A good example is St. Elisabeth's Convent, founded in 1999.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nKalvaryja (Calvary Cemetery) is the oldest surviving cemetery in the city. Many famous people of Belarus are buried here. The cemetery was closed to new burials in the 1960s.\nMilitary Cemetery\nEastern Cemetery\n\u010cy\u017eo\u016dskija Cemetery\nNorthern Cemetery\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nMajor theatres are:\n\nNational Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus \nBelarusian State Musical Theatre (performances in Russian)\nMaxim Gorky National Drama Theatre (performances in Russian)\nYanka Kupala National Drama Theatre (performances in Belarusian)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nMajor museums include:\n\nBelarusian National Arts Museum\nBelarusian Great Patriotic War Museum\nBelarusian National History and Culture Museum\nBelarusian Nature and Environment Museum\nMaksim Bahdanovi\u010d Literary Museum\nOld Belarusian History Museum\nYanka Kupala Literary MuseumArt galleries include:\n\n\u040e gallery\n\n\n=== Recreation areas ===\nChelyuskinites Park\nChildren's Railroad\nGorky Park (Minsk)\nYanka Kupala Park\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are more than 400 travel agencies in Minsk, about a quarter of them provide agent activity, and most of them are tour operators.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\nFC Dinamo Minsk\nFC Minsk\nFC Torpedo Minsk\nFC Energetik-BGU Minsk\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nHC Dinamo Minsk\nHC Yunost Minsk\n\n\n=== Handball ===\nSKA Minsk\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nBC Tsmoki-Minsk\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\nIn 2013, Minsk hosted the European Junior Rowing Championships at the Republican Center of Olympic Training for Rowing And Canoeing to the north-west of the city.Minsk hosted the 2014 IIHF World Championship at the Minsk Arena.\nIn January 2016, the 2016 European Speed Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena. Minsk Arena is the only indoor speed skating rink in Belarus.\nOn 21 October 2016, it was confirmed by the European Olympic Committee that Minsk will host the 2019 European Games.\nThe 2019 European Figure Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena from the 21st to 27 January.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nMinsk has an extensive public transport system. Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, Smolensk, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nAccording to the survey in 2019 (were interviewed 1934 people), in Minsk around 811 thousand of adult bicycles plus 232 thousand of child and adolescent bicycles. In Minsk one bike is for 1.9 people. The total number of bicycles in Minsk exceeds the total number of Cars (770 thousand of personal automobiles). 39% of Minsk residents have a personal bike. 43% of Minsk residents ride a bicycle once a month or more. As of 2017, the level of bicycle use is about 1% of all transport movements (for comparison: 12% in Berlin, 50% in Copenhagen).\n\nSince 2015, a bicycle parade / bicycle carnival held in Minsk, during which vehicles are blocked for several hours along Pobediteley (Peramohi) Avenue (one of the main streets of Minsk). The number of participants in 2019 was more than 20 thousand, the number of registrations was about 12 thousand.In 2017, the European Union funded the project \"Urban cycling in Belarus\" in the amount of 560 thousand euros, within the framework of which the public association Minsk Cycling Society together with the Council of Ministers created the regulatory document National Concept for the Development of Cycling in Belarus.\n\nSince 2013, a free public workshop \"Bicycle Kitchen Garage 38\" has been operating in Minsk, where everyone can use the tool and help repairing the bicycle. Free bike school works.In 2020, Minsk entered the top 3 most cycling cities in the CIS \u2013 after Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nMinsk National Airport is located 42 km (26 mi) to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current railway station opened in 1987. It is an international airport with flights to Europe and the Middle East.Minsk-1 opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1 million passengers a year.From 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, Kiev and Kaliningrad. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as Minsk-City.Minsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is located in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges, and 29 higher education institutions, including 12 major national universities.\n\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\nAcademy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

        "wiki": "Minsk (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a [m\u02b2insk], Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) is the capital and largest city of Belarus, located on the Svisla\u010d and the Nyamiha Rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom. A good example is St. Elisabeth's Convent, founded in 1999.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nKalvaryja (Calvary Cemetery) is the oldest surviving cemetery in the city. Many famous people of Belarus are buried here. The cemetery was closed to new burials in the 1960s.\nMilitary Cemetery\nEastern Cemetery\n\u010cy\u017eo\u016dskija Cemetery\nNorthern Cemetery\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nMajor theatres are:\n\nNational Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus \nBelarusian State Musical Theatre (performances in Russian)\nMaxim Gorky National Drama Theatre (performances in Russian)\nYanka Kupala National Drama Theatre (performances in Belarusian)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nMajor museums include:\n\nBelarusian National Arts Museum\nBelarusian Great Patriotic War Museum\nBelarusian National History and Culture Museum\nBelarusian Nature and Environment Museum\nMaksim Bahdanovi\u010d Literary Museum\nOld Belarusian History Museum\nYanka Kupala Literary MuseumArt galleries include:\n\n\u040e gallery\n\n\n=== Recreation areas ===\nChelyuskinites Park\nChildren's Railroad\nGorky Park (Minsk)\nYanka Kupala Park\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are more than 400 travel agencies in Minsk, about a quarter of them provide agent activity, and most of them are tour operators.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\nFC Dinamo Minsk\nFC Minsk\nFC Torpedo Minsk\nFC Energetik-BGU Minsk\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nHC Dinamo Minsk\nHC Yunost Minsk\n\n\n=== Handball ===\nSKA Minsk\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nBC Tsmoki-Minsk\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\nIn 2013, Minsk hosted the European Junior Rowing Championships at the Republican Center of Olympic Training for Rowing And Canoeing to the north-west of the city.Minsk hosted the 2014 IIHF World Championship at the Minsk Arena.\nIn January 2016, the 2016 European Speed Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena. Minsk Arena is the only indoor speed skating rink in Belarus.\nOn 21 October 2016, it was confirmed by the European Olympic Committee that Minsk will host the 2019 European Games.\nThe 2019 European Figure Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena from the 21st to 27 January.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nMinsk has an extensive public transport system. Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, Smolensk, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nAccording to the survey in 2019 (were interviewed 1934 people), in Minsk around 811 thousand of adult bicycles plus 232 thousand of child and adolescent bicycles. In Minsk one bike is for 1.9 people. The total number of bicycles in Minsk exceeds the total number of Cars (770 thousand of personal automobiles). 39% of Minsk residents have a personal bike. 43% of Minsk residents ride a bicycle once a month or more. As of 2017, the level of bicycle use is about 1% of all transport movements (for comparison: 12% in Berlin, 50% in Copenhagen).\n\nSince 2015, a bicycle parade / bicycle carnival held in Minsk, during which vehicles are blocked for several hours along Pobediteley (Peramohi) Avenue (one of the main streets of Minsk). The number of participants in 2019 was more than 20 thousand, the number of registrations was about 12 thousand.In 2017, the European Union funded the project \"Urban cycling in Belarus\" in the amount of 560 thousand euros, within the framework of which the public association Minsk Cycling Society together with the Council of Ministers created the regulatory document National Concept for the Development of Cycling in Belarus.\n\nSince 2013, a free public workshop \"Bicycle Kitchen Garage 38\" has been operating in Minsk, where everyone can use the tool and help repairing the bicycle. Free bike school works.In 2020, Minsk entered the top 3 most cycling cities in the CIS \u2013 after Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nMinsk National Airport is located 42 km (26 mi) to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current railway station opened in 1987. It is an international airport with flights to Europe and the Middle East.Minsk-1 opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1 million passengers a year.From 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, Kiev and Kaliningrad. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as Minsk-City.Minsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is located in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges, and 29 higher education institutions, including 12 major national universities.\n\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\nAcademy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

        "wiki": "Nasha Niva (Belarusian: \u041d\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u041d\u0456\u0432\u0430, romanized: Na\u0161a Niva, lit. \"Our field\") is one of the oldest Belarusian weekly newspapers, founded in 1906 and re-established in 1991. Na\u0161a Niva became a cultural symbol, due to the newspaper's importance as a publisher of Belarusian literature and as a pioneer of Belarusian language journalism, the years before the October Revolution are often referred to as the Na\u0161a Niva Period.\nNa\u0161a Niva Online, nn.by, was set up in 1997. It has since grown into what is currently the most frequently visited website in Belarusian language.\nThe current editor-in-chief is Jahor Marcinovi\u010d, who succeeded Andrej Dy\u0144ko.\nIn the period between 1906 and 1915 the newspaper was published on a weekly basis. From 1991 to 1995 it appeared once a month, reverting to weekly publication in 1996 and then fortnightly in the years 1997\u20141999. In 1999 the paper became a weekly again.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1906\u20131915 ===\nNa\u0161a Niva covered a wide range of political, economic and cultural issues. The newspaper saw as its main task the consolidation of a Belarusian political nation. It was also \u2013 as was observed at the time \u2013 the first source of information to be free of government interference.\nNational civil society rallied around the newspaper; numerous agricultural initiatives, youth groups and publishing houses used it as a voice to promote their activities.\nFrom the earliest days of its existence, the newspaper's characteristic feature was the strong interactive relationship that it built with readers. There were more than three thousand permanent and temporary correspondents who submitted information to the editor. A large number of contributors from various regions of Belarus were involved in the publication of both journalistic pieces and literary works. This provided a unique opportunity to re-establish the literary language by establishing norms of usage that were the most widespread throughout the country as a whole. The newspaper thereby played an invaluable role in fixing the orthography, grammar and word-formation patterns of the modern Belarusian language.\n\nSubscribers and correspondents of the newspaper became central figures of national political and intellectual life, e.g. Ci\u0161ka Hartny (pseudonym of \u0179micier \u017dy\u0142unovi\u010d), one of the first leaders of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, or Branis\u0142a\u016d Tara\u0161kievi\u010d, political leader in the Western Belarus and author of the first printed grammar of the Belarusian language.\nAlaksandr U\u0142asa\u016d, a landowner from the Miha\u016dka estate near Minsk, was for many years the newspaper's publisher and editor.\nOne of the major figures behind the formulation of the newspaper's political goals was Ivan \u0141uckievi\u010d from Minsk, founder of the famous Belarusian Museum in Vilnius and sponsor of numerous political and cultural projects.\nWorking alongside him was his brother, Anton \u0141uckievi\u010d, whose ideas were decisive in the formation of the programme of the Belarusian Socialist Party (Hramada). He would eventually become the Prime Minister of the Belarusian People's Republic.\nVac\u0142a\u016d \u0141asto\u016dski, another future Prime Minister of the Belarusian People's Republic, became secretary of the newspaper in 1909 and in the years 1912\u20141913 acted as its de facto editor.\nAnton \u0141uckievi\u010d, Alaksandr U\u0142asa\u016d, Branis\u0142a\u016d Tara\u0161kievi\u010d, \u0179micier \u017dy\u0142unovi\u010d and Vac\u0142a\u016d \u0141asto\u016dski were all murdered by the Soviet regime in the 1930s.\nJakub Ko\u0142as, a classic of Belarusian literature, was an active contributor to Na\u0161a Niva. It was also Na\u0161a Niva that discovered the works of Maksim Bahdanovi\u010d and \u0179mitrok Biadula. Janka Kupa\u0142a, a famous poet, became the newspaper's editor in February 1914 and continued in this role until the autumn of 1915 when Vilnius was occupied by the Germans and normal life in Belarus came to a standstill.\nThe newspaper's defence of national interests provoked attacks by the Russian censorship throughout its existence.\nEven a discussion on agrarian topics organised in 1907 \u2013 including an article entitled 'The Land Question in New Zealand' \u2013 was found 'seditious' and 'disrespectful of the government'. The editor, Alaksandr U\u0142asa\u016d, was tried and imprisoned. On several occasions the entire run of a particular issue was confiscated and the editors compelled to pay fines.\n\n\n==== Language ====\nIn the early 20th century, Na\u0161a Niva introduced standards of usage into the Belarusian literary language. It was actively involved in both the creation of classical Belarusian literature and the evolution of the idea of Belarusian statehood. The newspaper became the centre of intellectual life. The newspaper published the writings of many outstanding intellectual figures, including Janka Kupa\u0142a, Jakub Ko\u0142as, Anton \u0141uckievi\u010d, Maksim Bahdanovi\u010d and Vac\u0142a\u016d \u0141asto\u016dski.\nNa\u0161a Niva was published in the two alphabets adopted by the Belarusian language, Cyrillic and Latin. This practice was continued until October 1912 when a referendum of the editorial staff and readers opted for the Cyrillic alphabet. Na\u0161a Niva used the classical spelling from 1991 until 2008; it then shifted to the spelling taught in schools in order to 'improve communication between intellectuals and the public', as an editorial on the topic made clear at the time.\n\n\n==== Publishing ====\nThe newspaper acted as the focal point for the independent cultural and social projects that grew up around it.\nNa\u0161a Niva performed the coordinating function of a publishing centre. Especially popular were the annual Belarusian Calendars, almanacs in which readers could find not only the usual kind of day-to-day information but also literary works. The publishing centre also published books, both original and in translation. A satirical magazine 'Krapiva' (Nettles) was published in Vilnia in 1912, and the agricultural department of Na\u0161a Niva grew into the independent 'Sacha' (Wooden Plough) magazine published in Minsk from the end of 1913.\nUnder the newspaper's auspices one of Na\u0161a Niva's founders, Ivan \u0141uckievi\u010d, began to collect artefacts for the future Belarusian National Museum. Most of it is currently stored in the National History Museum of Lithuania.\nStaff of the newspaper staff helped Ihnat Bujnicki form the first Belarusian theatre company.\nThe newspaper focused its attention on the promotion of economic, legal and agricultural knowledge. The scale of the work it accomplished has allowed historians and researchers of culture to define early 20th century Belarusian culture as the 'Na\u0161a Niva period' when referring to the quantitative and qualitative changes in the development of modern culture and society.\n\n\n=== Revival attempt in 1920 ===\nThe first attempt to revive the newspaper was made in Vilnia in 1920. The first issue of the revived Na\u0161a Niva, now described as a socio-political and literature daily newspaper, appeared on 28 October 1920, soon after the beginning of \u017beligowski's Mutiny.\nIn December 1920 the newspaper was banned again, this time by the Polish military censorship.\n\n\n=== 1991: revival in Vilnius ===\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union and the rapid growth of the independence movement in Belarus made it possible for the newspaper to be re-established. The publication of Na\u0161a Niva began again in Vilnius, then Republic of Lithuania, in May 1991.\nThe revived newspaper came to occupy a special place among other Belarusian periodicals. Na\u0161a Niva abandoned the 'defensive strategy' and self-imposed isolation inherent to much of the Belarusian-language media of the Soviet times. The newspaper opened its pages to discussions on universal topics and published numerous translations of foreign literature. The paper discussed two topics in particular: the heritage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and a possible model of relations between Belarus and other nations of the region.\n\n\n=== Relocation to Minsk ===\nIn 1996, the newspaper's editorial office relocated to Minsk, Belarus.\nThe topics covered by Na\u0161a Niva shifted from literature and culture towards political and social issues.\nAfter 2000, the newspaper became a weekly once more. In 2002 the volume increased from 12 to 16 pages weekly, and in 2005 to 24. At its peak the print run reached 8,000. Following pressure from the state and denial of access to the national press distribution system, Na\u0161a Niva changed to a pocket format and increased the number of pages to 48. The circulation decreased to 2,200 copies.\nNa\u0161a Niva developed its online version, which by 2010 became the most popular internet resource in the Belarusian language. According to statistics drawn up by Google Analytics for 2006\u20142017 monthly visitors to the Na\u0161a Niva site average about 600,000 looking at 7,000,000 pages. Approximately 84% of the visits are from Belarus, 49% are from Minsk.\nIn the 1990s work began on the production of a facsimile edition of the issues of the newspaper that appeared in the years between 1906 and 1915. At the same time material has been collected for the compilation of a dictionary of the language used in those early years of Na\u0161a Niva.\n\n\n=== State pressure ===\nSince 1995 and especially in the 2000s, Na\u0161a Niva has faced pressure from the authoritarian regime of Alexander Lukashenko.\nThe paper was persecuted for using the traditional Belarusian orthography (Tara\u0161kievica). In 1998 the newspaper won a trial in court and got permission to continue using the classical orthography.\nIn 2005 the authorities banned distribution of the newspaper through the Belarusian postal system and the official distribution agency which delivered the paper to shops and kiosks. Between 2006 and 2008 the newspaper had to be distributed by volunteers.\nNa\u0161a Niva has been tried in court and fined on many occasions, with the KGB conducting searches both in the newspaper's office and the editors personally. In 2006 the newspaper's Chief Editor, Andrej Dy\u0144ko was arrested and spent some time in prison.\n\n\n== Editors in chief ==\nAlaksandr U\u0142asa\u016d: founder, editor from 1906 till 1912\nVac\u0142a\u016d \u0141asto\u016dski: in 1912\u20131913\nJanka Kupala: in 1914\u20131915\nSiarhiej Dubaviec: from 1991 till 2000.\nAndrej Dy\u0144ko: from 2000 till 2006; later became editor of Na\u0161a Niva's online version nn.by\nAndrej Skurko: from 2006 till 2017.\nIn 2011, \u0179micier Pankaviec was appointed editor of the weekly paper edition.\nJahor Marcinovi\u010d, recipient of the national award for investigative journalism several years in succession, became chief editor in 2017. Nasta Ro\u016dda invented Na\u0161a Nina sub-portal for women.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nIn December 2017, Nasha Niva has been mentioned among several Belarusian independent media that had allegedly removed old news stories about the 2015 arrest and ten months long imprisonment of the businessman Viktor Prokopenya from their websites. This had allegedly been done after the media were approached by Prokopenya's public relations advisors. The situation has caused a wide discussion among Belarusian journalists and media professionals.\n\n\n== External links ==\nNasha Niva Online (in English)\nInterview with Andrey Dynko\nThe Prague Society for International Cooperation\nThe History of Na\u0161a Niva from 1906 to the Present Day\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Just a quick word about Tripadvisor giving Frunzenskaya as the nearest metro station, it cost me two hours wandering around looking for a Cathedral that was supposed to be 200 metres away. In fact it is at Nemiga Station. Frunzenskaya has a very nice mural that is worth seeing",

          "Holy Spirit Cathedral is indeed marvellous. It might not look grand from outside but you cannot stop but satnd and stare admiring the beautiful fresco paintings when inside the church. The orthodox church in the middle of the city witneses a huge footfall so do expect it to be",

          "This is not an old cathedral, but it is very well attended. It's light, airy, and pleasant. The most interesting aspect is the many worshipers who come to pray, with a depth not seen as much in western churches today. The cathedral is sited on top of a hill with a good view of",

          "It is worth visiting at least becouse of the icon above the entrance (according to the legend it came to Minsk from Ukraine in a very usuasual way) and the coffin of St. Sophia Slutskaya (who was a real person, a defender of religion).",

          "Located next to the Old Town Hall building in a charming square full of restaurants and bars. This is an Orthodox church, the predominant religion in Minks. It is worth knowing if you are passing through town."

        "wiki": "Adam Bernard Mickiewicz ([mit\u0361s\u02c8k\u02b2\u025bvit\u0361\u0282] (listen); 24 December 1798 \u2013 26 November 1855) was a Polish poet, dramatist, essayist, publicist, translator, professor of Slavic literature, and political activist. He is regarded as national poet in Poland, Lithuania and Belarus. A principal figure in Polish Romanticism, he is counted as one of Poland's \"Three Bards\" (\"Trzej Wieszcze\") and is widely regarded as Poland's greatest poet. He is also considered one of the greatest Slavic and European poets and has been dubbed a \"Slavic bard\". A leading Romantic dramatist, he has been compared in Poland and Europe to Byron and Goethe.He is known chiefly for the poetic drama Dziady (Forefathers' Eve) and the national epic poem Pan Tadeusz. His other influential works include Konrad Wallenrod and Gra\u017cyna. All these served as inspiration for uprisings against the three imperial powers that had partitioned the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth out of existence.\nMickiewicz was born in the Russian-partitioned territories of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which had been part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and was active in the struggle to win independence for his home region.  After, as a consequence, spending five years exiled to central Russia, in 1829 he succeeded in leaving the Russian Empire and, like many of his compatriots, lived out the rest of his life abroad.  He settled first in Rome, then in Paris, where for a little over three years he lectured on Slavic literature at the Coll\u00e8ge de France.  He died, probably of cholera, at Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire, where he had gone to help organize Polish and Jewish forces to fight Russia in the Crimean War.\nIn 1890, his remains were repatriated from Montmorency, Val-d'Oise, in France, to Wawel Cathedral in Krak\u00f3w, Poland.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nAdam Mickiewicz was born on 24 December 1798, either at his paternal uncle's estate in Zaosie (now Zavosse) near Navahrudak (in Polish, Nowogr\u00f3dek) or in Navahrudak itself in what was then part of the Russian Empire and is now Belarus. The region was on the periphery of Lithuania proper and had been part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1795). Its upper class, including Mickiewicz's family, were either Polish or Polonized. The poet's father, Miko\u0142aj Mickiewicz, a lawyer, was a member of the Polish nobility (szlachta) and bore the hereditary Poraj coat-of-arms; Adam's mother was Barbara Mickiewicz, n\u00e9e Majewska. Adam was the second-born son in the family.Mickiewicz spent his childhood in Navahrudak, initially taught by his mother and private tutors. From 1807 to 1815 he attended a Dominican school following a curriculum that had been designed by the now-defunct Polish Commission for National Education, which had been the world's first ministry of education. He was a mediocre student, although active in games, theatricals, and the like.In September 1815, Mickiewicz enrolled at the Imperial University of Vilnius, studying to be a teacher. After graduating, under the terms of his government scholarship, he taught secondary school at Kaunas from 1819 to 1823.In 1818, in the Polish-language Tygodnik Wile\u0144ski (Wilno Weekly), he published his first poem, \"Zima miejska\" (\"City Winter\"). The next few years would see a maturing of his style from sentimentalism/neoclassicism to romanticism, first in his poetry anthologies published in Vilnius in 1822 and 1823; these anthologies included the poem \"Gra\u017cyna\" and the first-published parts (II and IV) of his major work, Dziady (Forefathers' Eve). By 1820 he had already finished another major romantic poem, \"Oda do m\u0142odo\u015bci\" (\"Ode to Youth\"), but it was considered to be too patriotic and revolutionary for publication and would not appear officially for many years.About the summer of 1820, Mickiewicz met the love of his life, Maryla Wereszczak\u00f3wna. They were unable to marry due to his family's poverty and relatively low social status; in addition, she was already engaged to Count Wawrzyniec Puttkamer, whom she would marry in 1821.\n\n\n=== Imprisonment and exile ===\n\nIn 1817, while still a student, Mickiewicz, Tomasz Zan and other friends had created a secret organization, the Philomaths. The group focused on self-education but had ties to a more radical, clearly pro-Polish-independence student group, the Filaret Association. An investigation of secret student organizations by Nikolay Novosiltsev, begun in early 1823, led to the arrests of a number of students and ex-student activists including Mickiewicz, who was taken into custody and imprisoned at Vilnius' Basilian Monastery in late 1823 or early 1824 (sources disagree as to the date). After investigation into his political activities, specifically his membership in the Philomaths, in 1824 Mickiewicz was banished to central Russia. Within a few hours of receiving the decree on 22 October 1824, he penned a poem into an album belonging to Salomea B\u00e9cu, the mother of Juliusz S\u0142owacki. (In 1975 this poem was set to music in Polish and Russian by Soviet composer David Tukhmanov.) Mickiewicz crossed the border into Russia about 11 November 1824, arriving in Saint Petersburg later that month. He would spend most of the next five years in Saint Petersburg and Moscow, except for a notable 1824 to 1825 excursion to Odessa, then on to Crimea. That visit, from February to November 1825, inspired a notable collection of sonnets (some love sonnets, and a series known as Crimean Sonnets, published a year later).Mickiewicz was welcomed into the leading literary circles of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, where he became a great favorite for his agreeable manners and extraordinary talent for poetic improvisation. The year 1828 saw the publication of his poem Konrad Wallenrod. Novosiltsev, who recognized its patriotic and subversive message, which had been missed by the Moscow censors, unsuccessfully attempted to sabotage its publication and to damage Mickiewicz's reputation.In Moscow, Mickiewicz met the Polish journalist and novelist Henryk Rzewuski and the Polish composer and piano virtuoso Maria Szymanowska, whose daughter, Celina Szymanowska, Mickiewicz would later marry in Paris, France. He also befriended the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin and Decembrist leaders including Kondraty Ryleyev. It was thanks to his friendships with many influential individuals that he was eventually able to obtain a passport and permission to leave Russia for Western Europe.\n\n\n=== European travels ===\n\nAfter serving five years of exile to Russia, Mickiewicz received permission to go abroad in 1829. On 1 June that year, he arrived in Weimar. By 6 June he was in Berlin, where he attended lectures by the philosopher Hegel. In February 1830 he visited Prague, later returning to Weimar, where he received a cordial reception from the writer, scientist and politician Goethe.He then continued on through Germany all the way to Italy, which he entered via the Alps' Spl\u00fcgen Pass. Accompanied by an old friend, the poet Antoni Edward Odyniec, he visited Milan, Venice, Florence and Rome. In August that same year (1830) he went to Geneva, where he met fellow Polish Bard Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski. During these travels he had a brief romance with Henrietta Ewa Ankwicz\u00f3wna, but class differences again prevented his marrying his new love.Finally about October 1830 he took up residence in Rome, which he declared \"the most amiable of foreign cities.\" Soon after, he learned about the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising in Poland, but he would not leave Rome until the spring of 1831.On 19 April 1831 Mickiewicz departed Rome, traveling to Geneva and Paris and later, on a false passport, to Germany, via Dresden and Leipzig arriving about 13 August in Pozna\u0144 (German name: Posen), then part of the Kingdom of Prussia. It is possible that during these travels he carried communications from the Italian Carbonari to the French underground, and delivered documents or money for the Polish insurgents from the Polish community in Paris, but reliable information on his activities at the time is scarce. Ultimately he never crossed into Russian Poland, where the Uprising was mainly happening; he stayed in German Poland (historically known to Poles as Wielkopolska, or Greater Poland), where he was well received by members of the local Polish nobility. He had a brief liaison with Konstancja \u0141ubie\u0144ska at her family estate in \u015amie\u0142\u00f3w. Starting in March 1832, Mickiewicz stayed several months in Dresden, in Saxony, where he wrote the third part of his poem Dziady.\n\n\n=== Paris \u00e9migr\u00e9 ===\n\nOn 31 July 1832 he arrived in Paris, accompanied by a close friend and fellow ex-Philomath, the future geologist and Chilean educator Ignacy Domeyko. In Paris, Mickiewicz became active in many Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 groups and published articles in Pielgrzym Polski (The Polish Pilgrim). The fall of 1832 saw the publication, in Paris, of the third part of his Dziady (smuggled into partitioned Poland), as well as of The Books of the Polish People and of the Polish Pilgrimage, which Mickiewicz self-published. In 1834 he published another masterpiece, his epic poem Pan Tadeusz.Pan Tadeusz, his longest poetic work, marked the end of his most productive literary period. Mickiewicz would create further notable works, such as Lausanne Lyrics, 1839\u201340) and Zdania i uwagi (Thoughts and Remarks, 1834\u201340), but neither would achieve the fame of his earlier works. His relative literary silence, beginning in the mid-1830s, has been variously interpreted:  he may have lost his talent; he may have chosen to focus on teaching and on political writing and organizing.On 22 July 1834, in Paris, he married Celina Szymanowska, daughter of composer and concert pianist Maria Agata Szymanowska. They would have six children (two daughters, Maria and Helena; and four sons, W\u0142adys\u0142aw, Aleksander, Jan and J\u00f3zef). Celina later became mentally ill, possibly with a major depressive disorder. In December 1838, marital problems caused Mickiewicz to attempt suicide. Celina would die on 5 March 1855.Mickiewicz and his family lived in relative poverty, their major source of income being occasional publication of his work \u2013 not a very profitable endeavor. They received support from friends and patrons, but not enough to substantially change their situation. Despite spending most of his remaining years in France, Mickiewicz would never receive French citizenship, nor any support from the French government. By the late 1830s he was less active as a writer, and also less visible on the Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 political scene.\n\nIn 1838 Mickiewicz became professor of Latin literature at the Lausanne Academy, in Switzerland. His lectures were well received, and in 1840 he was appointed to the newly established chair of Slavic languages and literatures at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. Leaving Lausanne, he was made an honorary Lausanne Academy professor.Mickiewicz would, however, hold the Coll\u00e8ge de France post for little more than three years, his last lecture being delivered on 28 May 1844. His lectures were popular, drawing many listeners in addition to enrolled students, and receiving reviews in the press. Some would be remembered much later; his sixteenth lecture, on Slavic theater, \"was to become a kind of gospel for Polish theater directors of the twentieth century.\"But he became increasingly possessed by religious mysticism as he fell under the influence of the Polish philosophers Andrzej Towia\u0144ski and Krzywi\u00f3ra Dahlsch\u00f6dstein, whom he met in 1841. His lectures became a medley of religion and politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government. The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, and some of his works were placed on the Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towia\u0144ski regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their followers to do so.In 1846 Mickiewicz severed his ties with Towia\u0144ski, following the rise of revolutionary sentiment in Europe, manifested in events such as the Krak\u00f3w Uprising of February 1846. Mickiewicz criticized Towia\u0144ski's passivity and returned to the traditional Catholic Church. In 1847 Mickiewicz befriended American journalist, critic and women's-rights advocate Margaret Fuller. In March 1848 he was part of a Polish delegation received in audience by Pope Pius IX, whom he asked to support the enslaved nations and the French Revolution of 1848. Soon after, in April 1848, he organized a military unit, the Mickiewicz Legion, to support the insurgents, hoping to liberate the Polish and other Slavic lands. The unit never became large enough to be more than symbolic, and in the fall of 1848 Mickiewicz returned to Paris and became more active again on the political scene.In December 1848 he was offered a post at the Jagiellonian University in Austrian-ruled Krak\u00f3w, but the offer was soon withdrawn after pressure from Austrian authorities. In the winter of 1848\u201349, Polish composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, in the final months of his own life, visited his ailing compatriot and soothed the poet's nerves with his piano music. Over a dozen years earlier, Chopin had set two of Mickiewicz's poems to music (see Polish songs by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin).\n\n\n=== Final years ===\n\nIn the winter of 1849 Mickiewicz founded a French-language newspaper, La Tribune des Peuples (The Peoples' Tribune), supported by a wealthy Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 activist, Ksawery Branicki. Mickiewicz wrote over 70 articles for the Tribune during its short existence:  it came out between 15 March and 10 November 1849, when the authorities shut it down. His articles supported democracy and socialism and many ideals of the French Revolution and of the Napoleonic era, though he held few illusions regarding the idealism of the House of Bonaparte. He supported the restoration of the French Empire in 1851. In April 1852 he lost his post at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, which he had been allowed to keep (though without the right to lecture). On 31 October 1852 he was hired as a librarian at the Biblioth\u00e8que de l'Arsenal. There he was visited by another Polish poet, Cyprian Norwid, who wrote of the meeting in his poem, \"Czarne kwiaty\" (\"Black Blossoms\"); and there Mickiewicz's wife Celina died.\n\nMickiewicz welcomed the Crimean War of 1853\u20131856, which he hoped would lead to a new European order including a restored independent Poland. His last composition, a Latin ode Ad Napolionem III Caesarem Augustum Ode in Bomersundum captum, honored Napoleon III and celebrated the British-French victory over Russia at the Battle of Bomarsund in the \u00c5land Islands in August 1854. Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s associated with the H\u00f4tel Lambert persuaded him to become active again in politics. Soon after the Crimean War broke out (October 1853), the French government entrusted him with a diplomatic mission. He left Paris on 11 September 1855, arriving in Constantinople, in the Ottoman Empire, on 22 September. There, working with Micha\u0142 Czajkowski (Sadyk Pasha), he began organizing Polish forces to fight under Ottoman command against Russia. With his friend Armand L\u00e9vy he also set about organizing a Jewish legion. He returned ill from a trip to a military camp to his apartment on Yeni\u015fehir Street in the Pera (now Beyo\u011flu) district of Constantinople and died on 26 November 1855. Though Tadeusz Boy-\u017bele\u0144ski and others have speculated that political enemies might have poisoned Mickiewicz, there is no proof of this, and he probably contracted cholera, which claimed other lives there at the time.Mickiewicz's remains were transported to France, boarding ship on 31 December 1855, and were buried at Montmorency, Val-d'Oise, on 21 January 1861. In 1890 they were disinterred, moved to Austrian Poland, and on 4 July entombed in the crypts of Krak\u00f3w's Wawel Cathedral, a place of final repose for a number of persons important to Poland's political and cultural history.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nMickiewicz's childhood environment exerted a major influence on his literary work. His early years were shaped by immersion in Belarusian folklore and by vivid memories, which he later reworked in his poems, of the ruins of Navahrudak Castle and of the triumphant entry and disastrous retreat of Polish and Napoleonic troops during Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia. The year 1812 also marked his father's death. Later, the poet's personality and subsequent works were greatly influenced by his four years of living and studying in Vilnius.\n\nHis first poems, such as the 1818 \"Zima miejska\" (\"City Winter\") and the 1819 \"Kartofla\" (\"Potato\"), were classical in style, influenced by Voltaire. His Ballads and Romances and poetry anthologies published in 1822 (including the opening poem \"Romantyczno\u015b\u0107\", \"Romanticism\") and 1823 mark the start of romanticism in Poland. Mickiewicz's influence popularized the use of folklore, folk literary forms, and historism in Polish romantic literature. His exile to Moscow exposed him to a cosmopolitan environment, more international than provincial Vilnius and Kaunas in Lithuania. This period saw a further evolution in his writing style, with Sonety (Sonnets, 1826) and Konrad Wallenrod (1828), both published in Russia. The Sonety, mainly comprising his Crimean Sonnets, highlight the poet's ability and desire to write, and his longing for his homeland.One of his major works, Dziady (Forefathers' Eve), comprises several parts written over an extended period of time. It began with publication of parts II and IV in 1823. Mi\u0142osz remarks that it was \"Mickiewicz's major theatrical achievement\", a work which Mickiewicz saw as ongoing and to be continued in further parts. Its title refers to the pagan ancestor commemoration that had been practiced by Slavic and Baltic peoples on All Souls' Day. The year 1832 saw the publication of part III:  much superior to the earlier parts, a \"laboratory of innovative genres, styles and forms\". Part III was largely written over a few days; the \"Great Improvisation\" section, a \"masterpiece of Polish poetry\", is said to have been created during a single inspired night. A long descriptive poem, \"Ust\u0119p\" (Digression), accompanying part III and written sometime before it, sums up Mickiewicz's experiences in, and views on, Russia, portrays it as a huge prison, pities the oppressed Russian people, and wonders about their future. Mi\u0142osz describes it as a \"summation of Polish attitudes towards Russia in the nineteenth century\" and notes that it inspired responses from Pushkin (\"The Bronze Horseman\") and Joseph Conrad (Under Western Eyes). The drama was first staged by Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski in 1901, becoming, in Mi\u0142osz's words, \"a kind of national sacred play, occasionally forbidden by censorship because of its emotional impact upon the audience.\"  The Polish government's 1968 closing down of a production of the play sparked the 1968 Polish political crisis.Mickiewicz's Konrad Wallenrod (1828), a narrative poem describing battles of the Christian order of Teutonic Knights against the pagans of Lithuania, is a thinly veiled allusion to the long feud between Russia and Poland. The plot involves the use of subterfuge against a stronger enemy, and the poem analyzes moral dilemmas faced by the Polish insurgents who would soon launch the November 1830 Uprising. Controversial to an older generation of readers, Konrad Wallenrod was seen by the young as a call to arms and was praised as such by an Uprising leader, poet Ludwik Nabielak. Mi\u0142osz describes Konrad Wallenrod (named for its protagonist) as \"the most committed politically of all Mickiewczi's poems.\" The point of the poem, though obvious to many, escaped the Russian censors, and the poem was allowed to be published, complete with its telling motto drawn from Machiavelli: \"Dovete adunque sapere come sono due generazioni di combattere \u2013 bisogna essere volpe e leone.\" (\"Ye shall know that there are two ways of fighting \u2013 you must be a fox and a lion.\") On a purely literary level, the poem was notable for incorporating traditional folk elements alongside stylistic innovations.\n\nSimilarly noteworthy is Mickiewicz's earlier and longer 1823 poem, Gra\u017cyna, depicting the exploits of a Lithuanian chieftainess against the Teutonic Knights. Mi\u0142osz writes that Gra\u017cyna \"combines a metallic beat of lines and syntactical rigor with a plot and motifs dear to the Romantics.\" It is said by Christien Ostrowski to have inspired Emilia Plater, a military heroine of the November 1830 Uprising. A similar message informs Mickiewicz's \"Oda do m\u0142odo\u015bci\" (\"Ode to Youth\").Mickiewicz's Crimean Sonnets (1825\u201326) and poems that he would later write in Rome and Lausanne, Mi\u0142osz notes, have been \"justly ranked among the highest achievements in Polish [lyric poetry].\" His 1830 travels in Italy likely inspired him to consider religious matters, and produced some of his best religiously-themed works, such as \"Arcymistrz\" (\"The Master\") and \"Do Marceliny \u0141empickiej\" (\"To Marcelina \u0141empicka\"). He was an authority to the young insurgents of 1830\u201331, who expected him to participate in the fighting (the poet Maurycy Gos\u0142awski wrote a dedicated poem urging him to do so). Yet it is likely that Mickiewicz was no longer as idealistic and supportive of military action as he had been a few years earlier, and his new works such as \"Do matki Polki\" (\"To a Polish Mother\", 1830), while still patriotic, also began to reflect on the tragedy of resistance. His meetings with refugees and escaping insurgents around 1831 resulted in works such as \"Reduta Ordona\" (\"Ordon's Redoubt\"), \"Nocleg\" (\"Night Bivouac\") and \"\u015amier\u0107 pu\u0142kownika\" (\"Death of the Colonel\"). Wyka notes the irony that some of the most important literary works about the 1830 Uprising were written by Mickiewicz, who never took part in a battle or even saw a battlefield.His Ksi\u0119gi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego (Books of the Polish Nation and the Polish Pilgrimage, 1832) opens with a historical-philosophical discussion of the history of humankind in which Mickiewicz argues that history is the history of now-unrealized freedom that awaits many oppressed nations in the future. It is followed by a longer \"moral catechism\" aimed at Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s. The book sets out a messianist metaphor of Poland as the \"Christ of nations\". Described by Wyka as a propaganda piece, it was relatively simple, using biblical metaphors and the like to reach less-discriminating readers. It became popular not only among Poles but, in translations, among some other peoples, primarily those which lacked their own sovereign states. The Books were influential in framing Mickiewicz's image among many not as that of a poet and author but as that of ideologue of freedom.\n\nPan Tadeusz (published 1834), another of his masterpieces, is an epic poem that draws a picture of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on the eve of Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia. It is written entirely in thirteen-syllable couplets. Originally intended as an apolitical idyll, it became, as Mi\u0142osz writes, \"something unique in world literature, and the problem of how to classify it has remained the crux of a constant quarrel among scholars\"; it \"has been called 'the last epos' in world literature\".  Pan Tadeusz was not highly regarded by contemporaries, nor by Mickiewicz himself, but in time it won acclaim as \"the highest achievement in all Polish literature.\"The occasional poems that Mickiewicz wrote in his final decades have been described as \"exquisite, gnomic, extremely short and concise\".  His Lausanne Lyrics, (1839\u201340) are, writes Mi\u0142osz, \"untranslatable masterpieces of metaphysical meditation. In Polish literature they are examples of that pure poetry that verges on silence.\"In the 1830s (as early as 1830; as late as 1837) he worked on a futurist or science-fiction work, A History of the Future. It predicted inventions similar to radio and television, and interplanetary communication using balloons. Written in French, it was never completed and was partly destroyed by the author. Other French-language works by Mickiewicz include the dramas Les Confederes de Bar (The Bar Confederates) and Jacques Jasi\u0144ski, ous les deux Polognes (Jacques Jasi\u0144ski, or the Two Polands). These would not achieve much recognition, and would not be published till 1866. While Mickiewicz did not write any poems in Lithuanian, and his command of that language has been described as likely limited, on one occasion in the early 1850s he transcribed a short folk song in that language, Ejk Tatuszeli i bytiu dar\u017ca.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nA prime figure of the Polish Romantic period, Mickiewicz is counted as one of Poland's's Three Bards (the others being Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski and Juliusz S\u0142owacki) and the greatest poet in all Polish literature. Mickiewicz has long been regarded as Poland's national poet and is a revered figure in Lithuania. He is also considered one of the greatest Slavic and European poets. He has been described as a \"Slavic bard\". He was a leading Romantic dramatist and has been compared in Poland and in Europe with Byron and Goethe.Mickiewicz's importance extends beyond literature to the broader spheres of culture and politics; Wyka writes that he was a \"singer and epic poet of the Polish people, and a pilgrim for the freedom of nations.\" Scholars have used the expression \"cult of Mickiewicz\" to describe the reverence in which he is held as a \"national prophet.\" On hearing of Mickiewicz's death, his fellow bard Krasi\u0144ski wrote: \"For men of my generation, he was milk and honey, gall and life's blood: we all descend from him. He carried us off on the surging billow of his inspiration and cast us into the world.\" Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin described Mickiewicz's works as Promethean, as \"reaching more Polish hearts\" than the other Polish Bards, and affirmed Danish critic Georg Brandes' assessment of Mickiewicz's works as \"healthier\" than those of Byron, Shakespeare, Homer, and Goethe. Koropeckyi writes that Mickiewicz has \"informed the foundations of [many] parties and ideologies\" in Poland from the 19th century to this day, \"down to the rappers in Poland's post-socialist blocks, who can somehow still declare that 'if Mickiewicz was alive today, he'd be a good rapper.'\" While Mickiewicz's popularity has endured two centuries in Poland, he is less well known abroad though, particularly in the 19th century, he won substantial international fame among \"people that dared resist the brutal might of reactionary empires.\"Mickiewicz has been written about or had works dedicated to him by many authors in Poland (Asnyk, Ga\u0142czy\u0144ski, Iwaszkiewicz, Jastrun, Kasprowicz, Lecho\u0144, Konopnicka, Teofil Lenartowicz, Norwid, Przybo\u015b, R\u00f3\u017cewicz, S\u0142onimski, S\u0142owacki, Staff, Tetmajer, Tuwim, Ujejski, Wierzy\u0144ski, Zaleski and others) and by authors outside Poland (Bryusov, Goethe, Pushkin, Uhland, Vrchlick\u00fd and others). He has been a character in works of fiction, including a large body of dramatized biographies, e.g., in 1900, Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski's Legion. He has also been a subject of many paintings, by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, J\u00f3zef Oleszkiewicz, Aleksander Or\u0142owski, Wojciech Stattler and Walenty Wa\u0144kowicz. Monuments and other tributes (streets and schools named for him) abound in Poland and Lithuania, and in other former territories of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth: Ukraine and Belarus. He has also been the subject of many statues and busts by Antoine Bourdelle, David d'Angers, Antoni Kurzawa, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Oleszczy\u0144ski, Zbigniew Pronaszko, Teodor Rygier, Wac\u0142aw Szymanowski and Jakub Tatarkiewicz. In 1898, the 100th anniversary of his birth, a towering statue by Cyprian Godebski was erected in Warsaw.  Its base carries the inscription, \"To the Poet from the People\". In 1955, the 100th anniversary of his death, the University of Pozna\u0144 adopted him as its official patron.A number of museums in Europe are dedicated to Mickiewicz.  Warsaw has an Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature. His house in Navahrudak, Belarus, is now a museum (Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Navahrudak); as is the house where he lived and died in Constantinople (Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Istanbul). There is a Mus\u00e9e Adam Mickiewicz in Paris, France.Much has been written about Mickiewicz, though the vast majority of this scholarly and popular literature is available only in Polish.  Works devoted to him, according to Koropeckyi, author of a 2008 English biography, \"could fill a good shelf or two\". Koropeckyi notes that, apart from some specialist literature, only five book-length biographies of Mickiewicz have been published in English. He also writes that, though many of Mickiewicz's works have been reprinted numerous times, no language has a \"definitive critical edition of his works.\"\n\n\n== Ethnicity ==\n\nAdam Mickiewicz, whose works were written in the Polish language, is generally known as a Polish poet. He is described by some authors as \"Polish-Lithuanian\". The Cambridge History of Russia describes him as Polish but sees his ethnic origins as \"Lithuanian-Belarusian (and perhaps Jewish).\" According to the Belarusian historian Rybczonek, Mickiewicz's mother had Tatar (Lipka Tatars) roots.Some sources assert that Mickiewicz's mother was descended from a converted, Frankist Jewish family. Others view this as improbable. Polish historian Kazimierz Wyka, in his biographic entry in Polski S\u0142ownik Biograficzny (1975) writes that this hypothesis, based on the fact that his mother's maiden name, Majewska, was popular among Frankist Jews, has not been proven. Wyka states that the poet's mother was the daughter of a noble (szlachta) family of Staryko\u0144 coat of arms, living on an estate at Czombr\u00f3w in Nowogr\u00f3dek Voivodeship (Navahrudak Voivodeship).The Lithuanian scholar of literature Juozapas Girdzijauskas writes that Mickiewicz's family was descended from an old Lithuanian noble family (Rimvydas) with origins predating Lithuania's Christianization. The Lithuanian nobility in Mickiewicz's time was heavily Polonized and spoke Polish. Mickiewicz had been brought up in the culture of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a multicultural state that had encompassed most of what today are the separate countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. To Mickiewicz, a splitting of that multicultural state into separate entities, due to trends such as Lithuanian separatism, was undesirable, if not outright unthinkable. According to Romanucci-Ross, while Mickiewicz called himself a  Litwin (\"Lithuanian\"), in his time the idea of a separate \"Lithuanian identity\", apart from a \"Polish\" one, did not exist. This multicultural aspect is evident in his works; his most famous poetic work, Pan Tadeusz, begins with the Polish-language invocation, \"O Lithuania, my country, thou art like good health ...\" (\"Litwo! Ojczyzno moja! ty jeste\u015b jak zdrowie ...\". It is generally accepted, however, that Mickiewicz, when referring to Lithuania, meant a historical region rather than a linguistic and cultural entity, and he often applied the term \"Lithuanian\" to the Slavic inhabitants of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (see Litvin). Mickiewicz joined the Philomaths while studying at Vilnius University, an organisation which supported the re-emergence of a Polish state free of Russian influence.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nOda do m\u0142odo\u015bci (Ode to Youth), 1820\nBallady i romanse (Ballads and Romances), 1822\nGra\u017cyna, 1823\nSonety krymskie (The Crimean Sonnets), 1826\nKonrad Wallenrod, 1828\nKsi\u0119gi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego (The Books of the Polish People and of the Polish Pilgrimage), 1832\nPan Tadeusz (Sir Thaddeus, Mr. Thaddeus), 1834\nLiryki loza\u0144skie  (Lausanne Lyrics), 1839\u201340\nDziady (Forefathers' Eve), four parts, published from 1822 to after the author's death\nL'histoire d'avenir (A History of the Future), unpublishedSource: Works by or about Adam Mickiewicz at Internet Archive\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of things named after Adam Mickiewicz\nList of Poles\nPolish literature\nAll pages with titles containing Mickiewicz\n\n\n== Notes ==\na ^  Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz and Kazimierz Wyka each note that Adam Mickiewicz's exact birthplace cannot be ascertained due to conflicting records and missing documentation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

Szymona i \u015bw. Heleny w Mi\u0144sku) also known as the Red Church (Belarusian: \u0427\u044b\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u044b \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0446\u0451\u043b) is a Roman Catholic church on Independence Square in Minsk, Belarus.\nThis neo-Romanesque church was designed by Polish architects Tomasz Pajzderski and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Marconi. The cornerstone was laid in 1905 and the church was completed in 1910. The bricks for its walls were sourced from Cz\u0119stochowa, whilst the roof tiles came from W\u0142oc\u0142awek. Its construction was financed by Edward Woyni\u0142\u0142owicz (1847-1928), a prominent Belarusian-Polish landowner, businessman and civic activist. The church was named and consecrated in memory of Woyni\u0142\u0142owicz's two deceased children, Szymon and Helena.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1903, about 2,000 of Minsk's Roman Catholics wrote a petition to local authorities asking for a site to start building new Catholic church. This request was approved and construction started in 1905. The church was consecrated on September 20, 1910. On December 21, 1910, the church was opened. At this time, Minsk was part of the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire.\nIn 1921, Minsk became the capital of the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR) within the Soviet Union and the church was sacked by the Red Army. In 1932, it was closed down by the Soviet authorities and was secularized. It was transferred to the State Polish Theatre of the BSSR. It was later used as a cinema. In 1941 during the Second World War, the German occupation administration returned the building to its original use as a church. After the war, it was again closed by the Soviet authorities and again used as a cinema.\nIn 1990, after two hunger strikes which were organized by the Minsk Catholic activists Anna Nicievska-Sinevicz and Edward Tarletski, the building was returned to the Roman Catholic Church. The church's interior has been fully restored and it is now an important centre of religious, cultural and social life in Minsk. It has also become a centre for the revived Belarusian Greek Catholic Church.\nIn 2006, the earthly remains of Edward Wayni\u0142\u0142owicz and his wife were reburied in the church. In 1921, Wayni\u0142\u0142owicz, the donor who had the church built, was forced to leave his home and lands in Slutsk, Belarus, due to the territorial changes after the First World War as stipulated in the Peace of Riga. He resettled in Bydgoszcz, Poland where he died in 1928.\nMass is celebrated in the church in Belarusian, Polish, Lithuanian, and Latin.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of parish St. Simeon and St. Helena in Minsk\nUnofficial website of the church\nJurkau kutoczak \u2014 \u042e\u0440\u043a\u0430\u045e \u043a\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0447\u0430\u043a \u2014 Yury's Corner. \u041a\u0430\u0441\u044c\u0446\u0451\u043b \u0421\u044c\u0432\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0445 \u0421\u044b\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0456 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044b (\u0427\u044b\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u044b \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0446\u0451\u043b)\nPhotos at Radzima.org\nPhotos at Globus.tut.by",

          "I'm not religous but you have to check out this church, you will inevitably see it at some point in your Minsk adventures. The inside isn't epic, but the pure age of the building gives you a couple goosebumps walking in. Have lunch out the front in the courtyard.",

          "The church in red brick has a serene atmosphere and lovely colorful rose windows on three sides. Inside there are two stalls to buy candles and other religious things.",
          "By Minsk standards, this is probably one of the top sites. If you compare it against other European churches, you'll be a bit disappointed. It's still a top site for the city, but keep your expectations in line.",
          "I recommend visiting this beautiful church that has an unique atmosphere! You feel enlightened and relaxed no matter what your views on religion are. You can go on Sunday evening to listen to the live music during mass. Nice experience!",

          "We accessed the church easily by Metro and we enjoyed the open space outside the church. The church itself and imposing and beautiful with a lot of old icons and aghiography on the ceiling. Outside the church, on the lefthand side, there is a memorial for Jews who lost their",

          "Very peaceful insight and remarkable outside - this church went through long history of occupation by Polish, Germans, USSR representatives being used as anything but religious object. Now serves as Catholic Church again. Worth to visit and explore insight-out",
          "Oldest Catholic Church in Minsk center. Was not destroyed during Second World War. Presently open for visits. Interesting Architecture. Near metro station and Goverment palace. Close to the railway station and historical building of the main post office. Recommend to visit",
          "It's a stunning building in the middle of Minsk, next to the parliament building. Very interesting design inside and out. It used to be Dom Kino (house of cinema) in the soviet times, and you couldn't get inside unless you had a pass. The doors are open today for all. Nice!",

          "Amazing gothic church for all who likes such type of architecture ;) Just add it to your collection of such churches. It's especially great at night, include it in your night Minsk tour",
          "Definitely give it a good walk around since most probably you will be in the vicinity anyway. I personally do not like the dark blue and red wall decor inside, but this is just my personal taste. I personally like to aura of St. Roch church on Golden Hill.",
          "Firstly it's a great point to find your orientation - if you are stood on the main road with your back to it the train station is towards your right, Minsk Dynamo Stadium is straight ahead (down the side streets) and October Square is towards your left. Arguably one of the most",

          "Here you can see how famous beer brand ALivaria is being produced. The brewery is very old and it is located in the building of that time.. It was very interesting to watch the process of making beer. After you can taste the product and, to be honest, I was surprised how good",
          "There you can know about the beer and the factory in connection to city history. At the end of excurcion you will have some degustation together with master-class about the correct way of tasting beer. That's really interesting. The only one problem is that everything is only",

        "wiki": "The Opera Nova is an opera house located in Bydgoszcz and established in 1956, which also plays the role of a musical theater.  It is one of the 10 opera houses in Poland and the only one of this size in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. Opera Nova also welcomes the scene of the Bydgoszcz Buratino Puppet Theatre.\n\n\n== Location ==\nOpera Nova building is located in a bend of the Brda river between Old Town and Downtown Bydgoszcz. The opera House is connected with a footbridge over the Brda river to Mill Island (Polish: Wyspa M\u0142y\u0144ska): from the surrounding terrace it overlooks Bydgoszcz Cathedral, and Mill Island's granaries and mills.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nOpera Nova is a cultural institution co-administrated by Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage & Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. It realizes artistic activities comprising operas, operettas, ballets and musicals. Its activities also include educational projects, such as introducing opera and ballet to children.\nThe Opera Nova company performs in Bydgoszcz, but also in other opera festivals in Poland and abroad. Since 1989, the ensemble has made numerous tours to Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Malta and Italy.\nOpera Nova extends its cultural influence out of Kuyavia-Pomerania, reaching audience and artists to neighboring provinces (Pi\u0142a, Koszalin, Olsztyn).The repertoire includes operettas, musicals, opera galas; it attracts a very enthusiastic and popular public. Financial sponsors of the Opera Nova, critical for such an institution, come from many financial and industrial tycoons in the area.Maciej Figas is since 1992 the director of the Opera Nova, he is also the conductor of the opera orchestra.\nIn 2014 more than 82,000 people came to the Opera Nova.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First times ===\nThe history of the theater in Bydgoszcz dates back to the 17th century, when was built a special theatre hall in the city Jesuit College, able to accommodate approximately 300 people. In the 19th century, operas and operettas were played in the Prussian Municipal Theatre; from 1896 to 1920, opera companies from Gda\u0144sk, Poznan or Rostock performed in Bromberg. In the years 1920-1939, a cultural institution run by the German minority called Deutsche B\u00fchne (English: German scene) was located in the backyard of Gdanska 66/68. It was a professional theatre, which displayed opera ensembles and orchestra performances based on the local Bydgoszcz Conservatoire located at Mickiewicz Alley N\u00b09. Its popularity matched Municipal Theatre. Deutsche B\u00fchne staged operas, operettas, musicals and vaudeville, hosting German companies (Berlin, Hamburg, K\u00f6nigsberg). On May 3, 1930, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Jan Kochanowski's birth, the theatre premiered \"The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys\" (Polish: Odprawa pos\u0142\u00f3w greckich), as a tribute to the Polish community. After 1933, its repertoire followed the cultural Nazi propaganda diktats.The first Polish opera in Bydgoszcz was founded in 1919. On October 3, 1921, members of Bydgoszcz Municipal Theatre presented the Polish national opera, Stanislaw Moniuszko's Halka. From 1921 to 1923, the Municipal Theatre organized summer opera seasons, with companies from Poznan and Warsaw opera houses. There were also recital singers with eminent artists from the world of Polish opera and operetta. Between 1923 and 1926, series of concerts in Bydgoszcz starred among others, Stanis\u0142aw Gruszczy\u0144ski, Ignacy Dygas, Jadwiga D\u0119bicka, Victoria Kawecka. In 1926, the first recital of New York's Metropolitan Opera's bass Adamo Didur had a huge success in the city. The Municipal Theatre invited several times in the 1920s and 1930s Ada Sari for recital performances with piano.For the season 1925/1926, an institution was created, the Pomeranian Opera Theatre of Bydgoszcz-Torun-Grudziadz directed by Karol Benda. The company included a 36-musician orchestra, a 22-singer chorus, a small ballet and external individuals from Warsaw, Poznan and Lviv. In addition, operetta guests were outstanding Polish artists of the time (Matilda Lewi\u0144ska-Poli\u0144ska, Ignacy Dygas, Stanis\u0142aw Gruszczy\u0144ski, Jan Kiepura, Lucyna Messal). The Pomeranian Opera performed in the Municipal Theatre 15 premieres and 69 operas and operettas, such as Halka, Rigoletto, Tosca, Carmen, Madama Butterfly, Aida, Countess Maritza, The Gay Hussars, The Merry Widow.\n\nDuring 11 seasons (1927-1938), the director Wladyslaw Stoma enlarged the repertoire of operas and operettas performed in the Bydgoszcz Municipal Theatre. In many instances, new pieces from Berlin and the Vienna have been specially translated for the Bydgoszcz institution. Wladyslaw Stoma hired professional singers and the orchestra acquired military professionals from the 61st Infantry Regiment (Polish: 61 Pu\u0142k Piechoty (II RP)) billeted in Pomorska Street. In the 1930s, the theatre staged with its own company forces (soloists, orchestra, choirs) operas Halka, La Traviata (1930), The Tales of Hoffmann, Madama Butterfly (1931), Carmen (1932), in addition to host every year Warsaw Opera performances. The last musical premiere before the outbreak World War II was Susanna, on April 4, 1939. Throughout the interwar period, performances were staged in the Municipal Theatre: Bydgoszcz did not possess yet any opera house.\nIn German occupation times, the Municipal Theatre was intended \"only for Germans\" and manned by a German-Latvian troupe from Riga under the direction of Heinrich Voit. The inaugural session on October 1, 1940, staged von Weber's opera Der Freisch\u00fctz. The repertoire of the theater until 1944 included several musical performances (opera, operetta, ballet evenings), and also Municipal Symphony Orchestra performances. In 1944, the German scene gave way to a decorated cinema building showing propaganda films.After the end of World War II, efforts were made to create a permanent Opera facility in Bydgoszcz, but despite large popular audience, the initiative did not get approval from the authorities, which did not believed in the success of the project. To overcome the situation, opera sessions were held by the Pomeranian Symphony Orchestra, together with Bydgoszcz Choirs, to perform opera overtures, fragments of orchestral and choral opera.\n\n\n=== Opera Studio ===\nOpera Studio (Polish: Studio Operowe), created on December 15, 1955, at the initiative of the Music Society. \"I. J. Paderewski\", was the first step towards a professional opera theater in Bydgoszcz. The initiator of the project was Felicia Krysiewicz, a singer, pianist and animator of musical life in Bydgoszcz.\n\nIn January 1956, an agreement for a working structure was reached with the cooperation of Pomeranian Philharmonic, Arion choir in Bydgoszcz and the Social Music and Ballet department: orchestra was directed by Zdzislaw Wendy\u0144ski, the choir by Antoni Rybka and the ballet by Raymond Sobiesiak. In May 1956, the Citizens' Committee for the Creation of Musical Theatre was established under the lead of Kazimierz Maludzi\u0144ski.On September 21, 1956, the inauguration of the Opera Studio premiered Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko's Flis and Verbum nobile, and Karol Kurpi\u0144ski's ballets The Marriage Fathers (Polish: Wesele w Ojcowie), with 150 people, including 20 solo-singers, 30 ballet dancers, 40 musicians and 60 chorus singers. In 1958 was created an institution called Bydgoszcz Comedy Music (Polish: Bydgoska Komedia Muzyczna) which aim was to perform in summer time operettas and musical pieces with tailored ensembles. Led by J\u00f3zef Szurka, it had realized by the end of the 1980s around 1500 performances throughout the country, mainly in small towns.Opera Studio repertoire gave the lion's share to comic opera and operetta classics. Performances were held in the building of the Polish Theatre in Mickiewicz Alley, in various clubs and occasionally in the hall of the Pomeranian House of Art. During its four-year activity, Opera Studio gave 10 premieres and around 400 performances, including 34 outside Bydgoszcz (Torun, Grudziadz, Inowroc\u0142aw, \u015awiecie) which attracted an audience of 22 000.\nIn 1958, thanks to minister credits, full-time soloists were engaged, as well as half-time choir, ballet and administration individuals. On April 10, 1958, the first ballet was played, The Nutcracker by Tchaikovsky, and on July 2, Offenbach's operetta Orpheus in the Underworld.Opera Studio was renamed on March 3, 1959, Musical Theatre of Opera and Operetta (Polish: Teatr Muzyczny Opery i Operetki), so as to meet cultural expectations of the inhabitants of the entire Bydgoszcz Voivodeship. A year later, on March 1, 1960, the institution was nationalized. In 1963, the Musical Theatre of Opera and Operetta had then its own orchestra established, putting an end to the use of musicians from the Pomeranian Philharmonic.\n\n\n=== State Opera and Operetta in Bydgoszcz ===\nBydgoszcz musical scene, once nationalised, changed its name several times: Opera and Operetta (1964), National Opera (1980), Opera Nova (1990), and from 1996, Opera Nova - State Opera in Bydgoszcz. Until the mid-1990s, the institution did not have its own facility: it used the Pomeranian Art House building and three times a week staged in Polish Theatre in Bydgoszcz. In spite of these unusual conditions, the company gained there its first experience and several artists who started here, appeared later on national stages in Warsaw, Lodz or Poznan: Barbara Zag\u00f3rzanka (soprano), Lidia Skowron, Bo\u017cena Kinasz-Miko\u0142ajczak, Bo\u017cena Betley, El\u017cbieta Hoffmann, Monika Olkisz-Chabros (soprano) Henryk K\u0142osi\u0144ski (tenor), Bronis\u0142aw Pekowski (bass-baritone), and others. Besides, the troupe hosted the greatest opera artists: Maria Foltyn (1960), Antonina Kawecka (1962), Bogna Sokorska (1960), Krystyna Szczepa\u0144ska (1964), Teresa \u017bylis-Gara (1959), Wies\u0142aw Ochman (1965), Bernard \u0141adysz (1960), Bogdan Paprocki (1962), Ryszard Tarasiewicz (1970) Marcin Bronikowski (1994, 2012).\nThe Bydgoszcz opera executed works by contemporary composers, who had their world premieres: musicals Hel of Jerzy Lawiny-\u015awi\u0119tochowski and Ryszard Damrosz (1965), opera Przemys\u0142aw II by Henryk Swolkie\u0144 (1986), ballets Anna Karenina by Radion Shchedrin (1979), Bernadett Matuszczak's Wild swans (1992) and Bogdan Pawlowski's Puss in boots (1997). Many companies from East and West countries came to Bydgoszcz stage and Opera Nova ensembles toured abroad, mainly to Western Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg), performing at numerous opera festivals. These foreign contacts resulted in an enhanced cooperation with opera music centers in Europe.\n\nIn the 1960s, operas and operettas were performed far out Bydgoszcz Voivodeship, in places like Pi\u0142a, Wa\u0142cz, Zielona G\u00f3ra, Konin, P\u0142ock, \u017bary. Most popular couple on stage was then Barbara Zag\u00f3rzanka and Henryk Herdzin. \nIn 1971, Bydgoszcz Opera and Operetta had cumulated 2200 performances watched by 1.2 million people. Guest soloists from socialist countries and outstanding Polish artists were invited, such as: Bernard \u0141adysz, Bogdan Paprocki, Antonina Kawecka, Krystyna Szczepa\u0144ska and Wieslaw Ochman.The idea to build a new seat for the Opera company in Bydgoszcz appeared in 1960 and was strongly supported by the then director of Pomeranian Philharmonic, Andrzej Szwalbe. It was the only solution to avoid performances being scattered in several smaller stages all around the city (Polish Theatre, Chamber Theatre, Pomeranian House of Arts or movie theatre). These scenes were not fitted at all for soloists, choir, ballet and orchestra.\nIn 1973, building started in a picturesque bend of the Brda river. Completion of the facility kept being delayed by high costs of construction and the deficit in materials and contractors. In the 1980s, facing budget cuts for culture, work came to a halt: some attempts were made to use the unfinished building, and realize cultural activities, like the first Bydgoszcz Opera Festival in 1994.Bydgoszcz Opera Festival was a good omen for the future Opera Nova. Staged operas, operettas and ballets helped to appreciate the capabilities of exposing the great forms of stage in a new building, the acoustic qualities of the auditorium, the technical capacities of the scene and the skills of the orchestra, choir and ballet. In 1996, the Opera Nova employed 170 people, including 23 soloists, 30 ballet dancers, 44 chorus singers, 56 musicians and others (conductors, directors...). The repertoire comprised 18 pieces: 8 operas, 4 operettas, 4 ballets and 2 musicals. After 1996, the company realised about 200 performances, including 110 Bydgoszcz and more than 90 abroad (mainly in Germany, Austria, Netherlands and Belgium). Since 1996-1997, Opera Nova performances attract approximately 40 000 per season.On October 21, 2006, the Bydgoszcz Opera House celebrated the 50th anniversary of the opera company in the city, together with the official completion of the Opera Nova building.\n\n\n=== Performances ===\nIn May 2016, Opera Nova had staged the most famous works of opera, operetta, ballet and musical since its inception, among others:\n\n\n== Opera House ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nThe idea of a building dedicated to the Bydgoszcz Opera dates back to the 1950s and 1960s, soon after the nationalization of the institution. The first initiative came from Andrzej Schwalbe, then director of the Pomeranian Philharmonic: for him it was clear from the start that the co-existence in the long run under one roof of two companies and orchestras could not achieve the needed artistic stability. Rationale was the successful attendance at opera performances and the lack of large auditoriums in the city, capable of satisfying the growing artistic aspirations of the public.\nIn 1961, a meeting between representatives of Bydgoszcz Music Society, Musical Theatre, Pomeranian Philharmonic, administrative authorities and architects, agreed to launch the project of a musical theater with two scenes and an art caf\u00e9. Different locations were considered for the future opera house: the place of the former Municipal Theatre, or Ludowy Park on Jagiello\u0144ska street, or again on the heights of Bydgoszcz. Finally the area chosen was the one between Focha street, Theatre square and Brda river. There have been standing large granaries -\"Royal granaries\" (Polish: spichrze kr\u00f3lewski)- which burnt down in the 1960s. Only buildings left in the 1960s were military facilities (warehouses, mess, garrison command).\n\nIn May, the Association of Polish Architects announced a national contest to \"develop the architectural design of the building of Musical Theatre and Drama in Bydgoszcz\". Jury comprised architects of Bydgoszcz, Gda\u0144sk, Poznan, Warsaw, and representatives from the Ministry of Culture and Art and the Pomeranian Philharmonic in Bydgoszcz. The prize winner was a young architect, Joseph Chmiel, who was also the author of the project for the Musical Theatre in Gdynia. The project presented an edifice composed of four intersecting circles, integrated into the meander of the Brda river.In 1962, the design phase of the building started, supported by the Gda\u0144sk University of Technology. The investment was planned in two steps, the first one from 1966 to 1971, the second stage after 1972. Contrary to expectations, construction did not start immediately, due to the delaying design work.The building has been planned to use of all modern technical capacities: extended stage depth and proscenium, designed trapdoor and an external platform, which could lift the stage up to height meters. A panoramic scene portal was designed, with a fireproof front curtain, allowing, if necessary, an increased stage space. In this manner, the auditorium could be able function as a theatre scene and a conference stage. The auditorium itself has been designed on the model of a theatre of ancient Greece, without any partition between loges and balconies, so that the audience could feel closer to the artists. \nIn 1973, building permits were issued and handed over to Budopol, the municipal firm in charge of the work. From 1973 to 1976, National Company \"Hydrobudowa 9\" from Poznan dug into the soil 1100 concrete piles. In the following years, design assumptions changed: from four intersecting rings, plans went down to two then eventually three. Issues to get building materials were recurrent and in 1977, at the time to secure the investment Polish Prime Minister Piotr Jaroszewicz canceled the project for economical reasons. However, local First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party in Bydgoszcz, J\u00f3zef Majchrzak, decided to overrule Warsaw's decision by continuing the construction.\n\nAlthough works were expected to end in 1982, the economic crisis of the 1980s reduced severely state funds allocated for culture, interrupting the construction. Building became a symbol of \"eternal investments\" and few people believed in its completion. It is only in 1985, thanks to an increased effort of provincial administrative authorities and cultural lobbies, that the continuation of the construction was insured through the National Culture Development Fund. In 1986, former military warehouses and Headquarters Garrison were at last demolished, getting the work accelerated. Between 1990 and 1994, the main body of the edifice housing the auditorium and the main stage was glazed, and the work moved to dressing rooms and rehearsal rooms, all of which was carried out by a specialized Company, \"Teatr\" from Warsaw. With the end of communist era, the Fund for the Development of Culture was liquidated, putting another threat to postpone the completion of the building. Construction was then focusing on the third circle, planned to host offices (TVP3 Bydgoszcz), a convention center and restaurants. Around this date, initiative was taken to use the raw building to organize the first Bydgoszcz Opera Festival: main points were to draw attention of the public and decision makers on this important project and to raise funds for its achievement.The first Bydgoszcz Opera Festival took place from 17 to 30 April 1994, in the harsh surroundings of the building. \nThe second half of 1990s brought a major positive change in the socio-political climate, helping out with investment, mainly from the provincial authorities. The construction of the Opera Nova in Bydgoszcz gained modern architectural solutions, new technologies, materials and theatrical capacities. The final stage of the investment occurred in the years 2002 to 2008: government of Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship decided to change the function of the third circle (originally, the area planned for production and decorations storage), so as to create a large convention center, where could be organized symposiums, meetings and congresses. Rationale behind such a decision was money related since the convention center approximately cost 20 million z\u0142 against 60 million z\u0142 for the initial project.\nThe building officially started operating on October 21, 2006, with a gala celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Opera activity in Bydgoszcz. Construction of Bydgoszcz opera house lasted 34 years and 5 months and is considered one of the longest building projects for a theater in post-war Poland. The Lublin Musical theater, however, is second to none in this contest, since its project started in 1974 and has only been completed on November 22, 2015.\nIn the years following its achievement, the Opera Nova has been used as a Regional Convention Center, organizing a number of cultural events and festivals. Since 2010, it houses the international Film festival Camerimage.\nTo be able to accommodate the growing success of Camerimage, a project of extension is currently underway. A fourth lobe to the actual building will be added, comprising a projection room for about 350 seats and an exhibition centre.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe building, by its own size, stands out in the architectural environment of the city centre: it has 6 levels, covers an area of 24 432 m2, has a volume of 120 700 m3 and a height of 34.19 m. Its location along the Brda river provides an opening to the Mill Island. The building, with its three connecting circles, affords optimal conditions for the realization of opera, operetta, ballet and musicals. Because of its original shape and position by the water, Opera Nova is often compared to the Sydney Opera House. The building has an illumination light system, one of Bydgoszcz hallmark by night.The First Circle hosts the main auditorium for 803 people, a large stage, two rehearsal rooms - for ballet and chorus, costumes storing area and a chamber hall with 189 seats (beneath the auditorium). It also houses workshops (clothing, hairdressing, wigs...)\nThe Second circle houses a ventilation chamber in the basement, on the ground floor an actor club, a large orchestra hall and a ballet rehearsal area, two floors for dressing rooms (choir and ballet), and on the top floor administration offices.\n\nThe Third circle is devoted to the Opera Nova Convention Center, with two conference rooms (more than 200 seats each), allowing the organization of large symposiums or seminars. There are also the Department of Promotion (entrance from Focha Street) and the restaurant \"Maestra\".\n\n\n=== Interiors ===\nThe large auditorium has a capacity of 803 seating places and 6 seats for disabled, the scene covers an area of 420 m2 (22 m wide and 25 m deep), and houses theatre equipment and lighting, and a revolving stage (11,80 m diameter). The scene portal is 9,5 m high and 18 m wide. The front curtain is steel and textile made, comprising 6 layers (10 m high and 21 m wide). The hall has an appreciated acoustic; it gives onto the lobby and two mezzanines.\n\nThe Chamber hall named after professor Felicia Krysiewicz, has 189 seats and 3 places for disabled. This Hall is generally used for chamber music, recitals, concerts and cinema projection.\nMain hall and foyer are spaces for the audience to wander during breaks. They house painting, sculpture and photography exhibitions.\nBehind the scenes are a number of workshops, warehouses, rehearsal rooms, dressing rooms. There is also Poland's largest elevator for transporting decorations and set pieces.\nThe Restaurant Maestra is located in the third circle of the building. Its interior is decorated with pictures from Opera Nova performances and a poster collection of the Bydgoszcz Opera Festival.\n\n\n=== Surroundings ===\nOpera Nova close neighborhood includes:\n\nan observation deck connected to the bank of Brda river;\na footbridge joining Mill Island in Bydgoszcz, through which you can reach Venice of Bydgoszcz or the Old market (Polish: Stary Rynek);\nat the bottom of Opera Nova, a summer amphitheater for 200 people giving onto the river. In 2016, a stage will be built on the river from the quay.On April 19, 2013, to celebrate the 667th anniversary of the city charter, a modern sculpture of The archer has been unveiled in front of the opera house, called the \"New Archer\" (Polish: \"\u0141uczniczka Nova\").\n\n\n=== Conference Center ===\nCongress Centre Opera Nova, occupying the third circle of the building, provides professional support for symposia, conferences, trade shows, conventions, exhibitions, anniversaries and performances of small theatrical plays. The Center houses two conference rooms (\"Manru\" and \"Fidelio\") for 300 and 220 people, five seminar rooms and a restaurant, \"Maestro\" with catering facilities.\nBoth rooms are equipped with electrically folding stands, electro-acoustic and simultaneous translation boothes. In addition, equipment includes: \n\naudio-visual capacities managed by touch panels\nmultimedia kiosks with Internet access\nmultimedia presentations capabilities.Combined use of the large Auditorium and the conference centre allow hosting very large gathering (up to 1,500 people).\n\n\n== Musical ensembles ==\n\n\n=== Soloists ===\nOpera Nova company includes more than 50 singer soloists: \n\n15 sopranos,\n8 mezzo-sopranos,\n15 tenors\n10 baritones,\n7 basses,along with actors, assistants, tutors and other staff personnel.\n\n\n=== Orchestra ===\nFrom 1956 to 1963, 40 musicians from Bydgoszcz Pomeranian Philarmonic were playing for each opera performances. A professional Opera Nova orchestra has been established in 1963, comprising initially 36 musicians, in majority graduates from Bydgoszcz Music Academy - \"Feliks Nowowiejski\". Several conductors led this group:\n\nToday, Opera Nova orchestra is 68 musicians strong, and its main conductor is the director of the Opera, Maciej Figas. Its yearly repertoire includes 32 pieces, mainly operas, operettas, ballets, oratorios, musicals from contemporary, popular and classical music. The orchestra always performs to accompany Opera Nova singers, as well as guest stars during galas in Poland and abroad.\n\n\n=== Choir ===\nThe Opera Nova Choir was established in 1956, under the leadership of Antoni Rybka. Most of its members were recruited from the \"Arion\" choir in Bydgoszcz. Consecutive Choir directors of the Choir have been Czeslaw Kaczmarek (1982-1984), Maciej Banach (1991-1992) and Henryk Wierzcho\u0144 (1984-1991 and since 1993). Over the years the choir mastered most of the works of world literature, opera, operetta, musicals and oratorios. Currently, choir band reaches approximately 80 people.Choir is augmented to stage performances of musical works with symphony orchestras: Pomeranian Philharmonic (for Bydgoszcz Music Festival), Koszalin Philharmonic and foreign. It is also involved in tours.\n\n\n=== Ballet ===\nOpera Nova Ballet was founded in 1956, initially with 40 dancers, in majority graduated students from Bydgoszcz ballet music center. Between 1959 and 1989, the ballet ensemble had a training room in the Chamber Theatre, then in the Pomeranian Arts House. Since the 1990s, the ballet working room is located in the building of the Opera Nova. Ballet repertoire includes around 30 works.Since its creation, the ballet premiered 6 times in Poland for The Nutcracker (1958), The King of the winds (Polish: Kr\u00f3l wichr\u00f3w) of Feliks Nowowiejski (1963), Legend of love (Polish: Legenda mi\u0142o\u015bci) of Mielikov (1967), Fairy tale and stone flower (Polish: Ba\u015b\u0144 i kamiennym kwiecie) of Sergei Prokofiev (1970), Anna Karenina by Rodion Shchedrin (1979) and a world premiere, the fairy tale ballet Puss in boots by Bogdan Pawlowski (1997). In 2011, ballet company was about 50 people strong, led by Ilona Ja\u015bwin-Madejska.\nFrom 1995, with the creation of the Opera Nova Ballet Studio, children and youth groups follow shortened course ballet school. Some of their members are involved in performances of ballet and musicals.\n\n\n== Bydgoszcz Opera Festival ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nBydgoszcz Opera Festival was born in 1994, associated with the difficulties to achieve the project of the Opera Nova building started in 1973. From 17 to 30 April 1994, the best troupes of Polish opera performed on the unfinished opera stage - Poznan, Lodz and Warsaw, Warsaw Chamber Opera, but also Askold Makarov Theatre Ballet of Saint Petersburg. \nAll sessions were held in a harsh scenery of bare walls, and the audience was set in 500 wooden chairs borrowed from the military. The numerous audience which came to this unusual event rewarded the artists and the direction, creating a sublime festival. The almost eerie musical environment became one of the main strength of the event. It received a positive welcome from the artists and the audience, and provided a nationwide publicity for Bydgoszcz opera stage. The festival had reached its main goal: to stop a 20-year long procrastination in the construction of the opera house.The success of subsequent editions exceeded organizers' expectations: tickets were sold out long before the first day. With such possibilities, added to the new scene of Bydgoszcz opera house, it was possible to create large-scale performances of opera and ballet. For instance:\n\nGiuseppe Verdi's Macbeth performed by company from the Warsaw Grand Theatre (2nd edition, 1995);\nGiuseppe Verdi's La forza del destino presented by the Grand Theatre of Pozna\u0144 (8th edition, 2001);\nModest Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov performed by the National Opera of Kiev (3rd edition, 1996);\nTurandot by Giacomo Puccini, presented by Opera Nova troupe at the opening of the 3rd edition (1996).For the first time in Bydgoszcz were presented the following ballets:\n\nAram Khachaturian's Spartacus performed by the Grand Academic Ballet Theatre of Belarus in Belarus Minsk (2nd edition, 1995);\nProkofiev's Cinderella executed by the Royal ballet of Antwerp (6th edition, 1999);\nL\u00e9o Delibes's Copp\u00e9lia performed by the Latvian National Opera in Riga (7th edition, 2000).Through the Festival occurrences, other famous companies performed: troupe from Chicago (7th edition, 2000) or the Cullberg Ballet from Sweden which executed a modern choreography of the Sleeping Beauty (7th edition, 2001).\n\n\n=== Characteristics ===\nOpera Festival Bydgoszcz is the biggest Polish review of diverse musical genres in the area of opera, operetta, musical and ballet, both classic and modern.

        "wiki": "Minsk (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a [m\u02b2insk], Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) is the capital and largest city of Belarus, located on the Svisla\u010d and the Nyamiha Rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of Minsk Region (voblas\u0107) and Minsk District (rajon). The population in January 2018 was 1,982,444, (not including suburbs) making Minsk the 11th most populous city in Europe. Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its Executive Secretary.\nThe earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. The settlement developed on the rivers. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom. A good example is St. Elisabeth's Convent, founded in 1999.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Cemeteries ===\nKalvaryja (Calvary Cemetery) is the oldest surviving cemetery in the city. Many famous people of Belarus are buried here. The cemetery was closed to new burials in the 1960s.\nMilitary Cemetery\nEastern Cemetery\n\u010cy\u017eo\u016dskija Cemetery\nNorthern Cemetery\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nMajor theatres are:\n\nNational Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus \nBelarusian State Musical Theatre (performances in Russian)\nMaxim Gorky National Drama Theatre (performances in Russian)\nYanka Kupala National Drama Theatre (performances in Belarusian)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nMajor museums include:\n\nBelarusian National Arts Museum\nBelarusian Great Patriotic War Museum\nBelarusian National History and Culture Museum\nBelarusian Nature and Environment Museum\nMaksim Bahdanovi\u010d Literary Museum\nOld Belarusian History Museum\nYanka Kupala Literary MuseumArt galleries include:\n\n\u040e gallery\n\n\n=== Recreation areas ===\nChelyuskinites Park\nChildren's Railroad\nGorky Park (Minsk)\nYanka Kupala Park\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are more than 400 travel agencies in Minsk, about a quarter of them provide agent activity, and most of them are tour operators.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\nFC Dinamo Minsk\nFC Minsk\nFC Torpedo Minsk\nFC Energetik-BGU Minsk\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nHC Dinamo Minsk\nHC Yunost Minsk\n\n\n=== Handball ===\nSKA Minsk\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nBC Tsmoki-Minsk\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\nIn 2013, Minsk hosted the European Junior Rowing Championships at the Republican Center of Olympic Training for Rowing And Canoeing to the north-west of the city.Minsk hosted the 2014 IIHF World Championship at the Minsk Arena.\nIn January 2016, the 2016 European Speed Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena. Minsk Arena is the only indoor speed skating rink in Belarus.\nOn 21 October 2016, it was confirmed by the European Olympic Committee that Minsk will host the 2019 European Games.\nThe 2019 European Figure Skating Championships were held in the Minsk Arena from the 21st to 27 January.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\nMinsk has an extensive public transport system. Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, Smolensk, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nAccording to the survey in 2019 (were interviewed 1934 people), in Minsk around 811 thousand of adult bicycles plus 232 thousand of child and adolescent bicycles. In Minsk one bike is for 1.9 people. The total number of bicycles in Minsk exceeds the total number of Cars (770 thousand of personal automobiles). 39% of Minsk residents have a personal bike. 43% of Minsk residents ride a bicycle once a month or more. As of 2017, the level of bicycle use is about 1% of all transport movements (for comparison: 12% in Berlin, 50% in Copenhagen).\n\nSince 2015, a bicycle parade / bicycle carnival held in Minsk, during which vehicles are blocked for several hours along Pobediteley (Peramohi) Avenue (one of the main streets of Minsk). The number of participants in 2019 was more than 20 thousand, the number of registrations was about 12 thousand.In 2017, the European Union funded the project \"Urban cycling in Belarus\" in the amount of 560 thousand euros, within the framework of which the public association Minsk Cycling Society together with the Council of Ministers created the regulatory document National Concept for the Development of Cycling in Belarus.\n\nSince 2013, a free public workshop \"Bicycle Kitchen Garage 38\" has been operating in Minsk, where everyone can use the tool and help repairing the bicycle. Free bike school works.In 2020, Minsk entered the top 3 most cycling cities in the CIS \u2013 after Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nMinsk National Airport is located 42 km (26 mi) to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current railway station opened in 1987. It is an international airport with flights to Europe and the Middle East.Minsk-1 opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1 million passengers a year.From 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, Kiev and Kaliningrad. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as Minsk-City.Minsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is located in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges, and 29 higher education institutions, including 12 major national universities.\n\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\nAcademy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus. The Academy was established in 1991 and it acquired the status of a presidential institution in 1995.

It received town privileges in 1499.From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk Voivodeship, in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.\n\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe Old East Slavic name of the town was \u041c\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a (i.e. M\u011bnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European M\u0113n\u012dsk\u016d), derived from a river name M\u011bn (< M\u0113n\u016d). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is Miensk (pronounced [m\u02b2\u025bnsk]).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a or \u041c\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044a), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a) and Polish (Mi\u0144sk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a) as their preferred name for the city.When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names Mi\u0144sk Litewski 'Minsk of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania' and Mi\u0144sk Bia\u0142oruski 'Minsk in Belarus' were used to differentiate this place name from Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki 'Minsk in Masovia'. In modern Polish, Mi\u0144sk without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki; (cf. Brest-Litovsk and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski for a similar case).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe area of today's Minsk was settled by Lithuanians in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The Svislach River valley was the settlement boundary between two Early East Slav tribes \u2013 the Krivichs and Dregovichs. By 980, the area was incorporated into the early medieval Principality of Polotsk, one of the earliest East Slav principalities of Old Rus' state. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form M\u011bnesk\u044a (\u041c\u0463\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u044a) in the Primary Chronicle for the year 1067 in association with the Battle on the River Nemiga. 1067 is now widely accepted as the founding year of Minsk. City authorities consider the date of 3 March 1067, to be the exact founding date of the city, though the town (by then fortified by wooden walls) had certainly existed for some time by then. The origin of the name is unknown but there are several theories.In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The Principality of Minsk was established by one of the Polotsk dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kiev, the dominant principality of Kievan Rus; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n\nMinsk escaped the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1237\u20131239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of Minsk Voivodship (province). In 1441, as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, Alexander I Jagiellon, Minsk received town privileges under Magdeburg law. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged into a single state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was also an important centre for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Following the Union of Brest, both the Uniate church and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of Tsar Alexei of Russia. Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by John II Casimir, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the Polish-Russian War, Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the Great Northern War, when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of Charles XII of Sweden and then by the army of Peter the Great. The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nMinsk was annexed by Russia in 1793 as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1796, it became the centre of the Minsk Governorate. All of the initial street names were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm\u00e9e during French invasion of Russia in 1812.Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti (\"Minsk province news\") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of 2 and 3-story brick and stone houses in Upper Town.Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-Warsaw road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava (Liep\u0101ja) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A municipal water supply was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 Russian census, the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Bolsheviks and eventually the CPSU, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnia. However, the First World War affected the development of Minsk tremendously. By 1915, Minsk was a battle-front city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of the Western Front of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and military supply bases.The Russian Revolution had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, German forces occupied Minsk on 21 February 1918. On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belarusian People's Republic. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the Red Army. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the Belorussian SSR, though later in 1919 (see Operation Minsk) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the Second Polish Republic during the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the Peace of Riga, Minsk was handed back to the Russian SFSR and became the capital of the Belorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000 people, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, Minsk immediately came under attack. The city was bombed on the first day of the invasion and came under Wehrmacht control four days later. However, some factories, museums and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of Reichskomissariat Ostland. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see Minsk Ghetto). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the Soviet partisan resistance movement against the invasion, in what is known as the German-Soviet War. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.\n\nMinsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944, during Operation Bagration. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, power stations, bridges, most roads and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Minsk was rebuilt, but not reconstructed. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1 million in 1972 and 1.5 million in 1986.\nConstruction of Minsk Metro began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.\nThe rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of skilled workers from other parts of the Soviet Union. To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries. Its surrounding villages were absorbed and rebuilt as mikroraions, districts of high-density apartment housing.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an economic crisis and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new mikroraions of residential development have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the Minsk BeltWay) has been improved. In the recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing, and with a third line of Minsk Metro set to open in 2020, the city is expected to change even further. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMinsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river Nioman) to the northeast \u2013 that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern Belarus. The average altitude above sea level is 220 metres (720 ft). The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two most recent ice ages. The Svislach River, which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the urstromtal, an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the Black Sea basin.\nMinsk is in the area of mixed forests typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the Chelyuskinites Park) as the city grew.\nThe city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nMinsk has a warm summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb) though unpredictable many a times, owing to its location between the strong influence of the moist air of the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air of the Eurasian landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is \u22124.5 \u00b0C (23.9 \u00b0F), while the average July temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at 35.8 \u00b0C (96 \u00b0F). Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives annual precipitation of 690 millimetres (27 in), of which one third falls during the cold period (as snow and rain) and two-thirds in the warm period. Throughout the year, most winds are westerly and northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic. Similar climatic regimes are found in Stockholm, Sweden and in Halifax, Canada.\n\n\n=== Ecological situation ===\nThe ecological situation is monitored by Republican Centre of Radioactive and Environmental Control.During 2003\u20132008 the overall weight of contaminants increased from 186,000 to 247,400 tons. The change from gas as industrial fuel to mazut for financial reasons has worsened the ecological situation. However, the majority of overall air pollution is produced by cars. Belarusian traffic police DAI every year hold operation \"Clean Air\" to prevent the use of cars with extremely polluting engines. Sometimes the maximum normative concentration of formaldehyde and ammonia in air is exceeded in Zavodski District. Other major contaminants are Chromium-VI and nitrogen dioxide. Zavodski, Partyzanski and Leninski districts, which are located in the southeastern part of Minsk, are the most polluted areas in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\n* Census\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nDuring its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day Belarusians). After the 1569 Polish\u2013Lithuanian union, the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews (Ashkenazim, who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, many Minsk residents became polonised, adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the Russian Empire. The Russians dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in earlier centuries.At the time of the 1897 census under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of Lipka Tatars had been living in Minsk for centuries.Between the 1880s and 1930s many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a Belarusian diaspora.\n\nThe high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in the Holocaust. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic Belarusians increased markedly. Numerous skilled Russians and other migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector. In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and Tatars (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39% \u2013 in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13% \u2013 from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry \u2013 in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.The Jewish population of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from Tatarstan.Some more recent ethnic minority communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the Caucasus countries \u2013 Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Georgians each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the retail trade in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of Romani, numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThroughout its history Minsk has been a city of many languages. Initially most of its residents spoke Ruthenian (which later developed into modern Belarusian). However, after 1569 the official language was Polish. In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language \u2013 its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the intelligentsia. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president Alexander Lukashenko slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.The most commonly used and understood foreign language in Minsk, especially among the younger generation, is English.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is the exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholics.As of 2006, there are approximately 30 religious communities of various denominations in Minsk.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMinsk has the highest crime rate in Belarus \u2013 193.5 crimes per 10,000 citizens. 20\u201325% of all serious crimes in Belarus, 55% of bribes and 67% of mobile phone thefts are committed in Minsk. However, attorney general Grigory Vasilevich stated that homicide rate in Minsk in 2008 was \"relatively fine\".Crime rate grew significantly in 2009 and 2010: for example, number of corruption crimes grew by 36% in 2009 alone. Crime detection level varies from 13% in burglary to 92% in homicide with an average 40.1%. Many dwellers are concerned for their safety at night and the strongest concern was expressed by residents of Chizhovka and Shabany microdistricts (both in Zavodski District).The SIZO-1 detention center, IK-1 general prison, and the KGB special jail called \"Amerikanka\" are all located in Minsk. Alexander Lukashenko's rivals in the 2010 presidential election were imprisoned in the KGB jail along with other prominent politicians and civil activists. Ales Michalevic, who was kept in this jail, accused the KGB of using torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMinsk is the economic capital of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget. According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15 trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 19.9 trillion BYR. In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two Gazprom's and one Lukoil's subsidiaries), two mobile network operators (MTS and A1), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.In 2012, Gross Regional Product of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).\nGRP of Minsk measured in rubles is 33 billion, or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nMinsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I and especially during World War II. After the last war the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of R&D-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in urban development in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon'). Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR, and the break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991\u20131994.However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under Alexander Lukashenko's government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained. Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the work force is still employed in the manufacturing sector. Over 70% of produced goods are exported from Belarus, especially to Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the recent industrial revival did not lead to updating technologies and equipment (as FDI was discouraged), therefore much of the local industry is not highly competitive by international standards.Major industrial employers include:\n\nMinsk Tractor Plant \u2013 specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS. Employs about 30,000 staff.\nMinsk Automobile Plant \u2013 specialising in producing trucks, buses and mini-vans. Established in 1944 in south-eastern Minsk, is among major vehicle manufacturers in the CIS.\nMinsk Refrigerator Plant (also known as Atlant) \u2013 specialised in manufacturing household goods, such as refrigerators, freezers, and recently also of washing machines. Established in 1959 in north-west of the city.\nHorizont \u2013 specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nIn 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%. During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.\nThe government discourages official unemployment registration with tiny unemployment benefits (70 000 BYR \u2248 $7 per month) and obligatory public works.\n\n\n== Government and administrative divisions ==\n\nCurrently Minsk is subdivided into 9 raions (districts):\n\nIn addition, a number of residential neighbourhoods are recognised in Minsk, called microdistricts, with no separate administration.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nMinsk is the major cultural centre of Belarus. Its first theatres and libraries were established in the middle of the 19th century. Now it has 11 theatres and 16 museums. There are 20 cinemas and 139 libraries.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the Bernardine convent. It was built in the simplified Baroque style in 1642\u201387 and went through renovations in 1741\u201346 and 1869.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Mary was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700\u201310, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;\nTwo other historic churches are the cathedral of Saint Joseph, formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644\u201352 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.\nThe impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Red Church (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906\u201310 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;\nThe largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene;\nMany Orthodox churches were built after the dissolution of the USSR in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom.

Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 trolleybus lines, 2 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892 \u2013 the horse-tram, and since 1929 \u2013 the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport not-for-profit company. As of January 2008, Minsktrans used 1,420 buses, 1,010 trolleybuses and 153 tramway cars in Minsk.The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. Currently the number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level.Public transport fares are controlled by city's executive committee (city council). Single trip ticket for bus, trolleybus or tramway costs 0.6 BYN (\u2248 USD 0.3), 0.65 BYN for metro and 0.75 BYN for express buses. Monthly ticket for one kind of transport costs 27 BYN and 49 BYN for all four. Commercial marshrutka's prices varies from 1.5 to 2 BYN.\n\n\n=== Rapid transit ===\n\nMinsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground metro system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into two lines: Masko\u016dskaja and A\u016dtazavodskaja, which are 18.1 and 17.3 km (11.2 and 10.7 mi) long with 14 and 14 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened; work continues on a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) extension, with one more station slated to open in 2014.There are plans for a network with three lines totalling (based on present expansion plans) 58.3 km (36.2 mi) of track with 45 stations and three train depots. For this to happen the third line should cut the city on a north\u2013south axis crossing the existing two and thus forming a typical Soviet triangle layout; construction of the third line is expected to begin in 2011 and for the first stage to be delivered in the late 2010s. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.As of 2013 Minsk metro had 28 stations and 35.5 kilometres (22 miles) of tracks. Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1 million passengers, in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1 million passengers,\nmaking it the 5th busiest metro network in the former USSR (behind Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev and Kharkiv). During peak hours trains run each 2\u20132.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,200 staff.Currently most of the urban transport is being actively renovated and upgraded to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.\n\n\n=== Railway and intercity bus ===\n\nMinsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the Warsaw-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the Liepaja-Romny railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski vakzal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski railway station was built during 1991\u20132002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There are plans to move all suburban rail traffic from Minsk-Pasa\u017eyrski to the smaller stations, Minsk-\nUschodni (East), Minsk-Pa\u016ddniovy (South) and Minsk-Pa\u016dno\u010dny (North), by 2020.There are three intercity bus stations that link Minsk with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. Frequent schedules of bus routes connect Minsk to Moscow, Smolensk, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev and Warsaw.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nAccording to the survey in 2019 (were interviewed 1934 people), in Minsk around 811 thousand of adult bicycles plus 232 thousand of child and adolescent bicycles. In Minsk one bike is for 1.9 people. The total number of bicycles in Minsk exceeds the total number of Cars (770 thousand of personal automobiles). 39% of Minsk residents have a personal bike. 43% of Minsk residents ride a bicycle once a month or more. As of 2017, the level of bicycle use is about 1% of all transport movements (for comparison: 12% in Berlin, 50% in Copenhagen).\n\nSince 2015, a bicycle parade / bicycle carnival held in Minsk, during which vehicles are blocked for several hours along Pobediteley (Peramohi) Avenue (one of the main streets of Minsk). The number of participants in 2019 was more than 20 thousand, the number of registrations was about 12 thousand.In 2017, the European Union funded the project \"Urban cycling in Belarus\" in the amount of 560 thousand euros, within the framework of which the public association Minsk Cycling Society together with the Council of Ministers created the regulatory document National Concept for the Development of Cycling in Belarus.\n\nSince 2013, a free public workshop \"Bicycle Kitchen Garage 38\" has been operating in Minsk, where everyone can use the tool and help repairing the bicycle. Free bike school works.In 2020, Minsk entered the top 3 most cycling cities in the CIS \u2013 after Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nMinsk National Airport is located 42 km (26 mi) to the east of the city. It opened in 1982 and the current railway station opened in 1987. It is an international airport with flights to Europe and the Middle East.Minsk-1 opened in 1933 a few kilometres to the south of the historical centre. In 1955 it became an international airport and by 1970 served over 1 million passengers a year.From 1982 it mainly served domestic routes in Belarus and short-haul routes to Moscow, Kiev and Kaliningrad. Minsk-1 was expected to be closed in 2008 because of the noise pollution in the surrounding residential areas, but in the mid-2010 it is still functioning. The land of the airport is planned to be redeveloped for residential and commercial real estate, currently branded as Minsk-City.Minsk Borovaya Airfield (UMMB) is located in a suburb north-east of the city, next to Zaliony Luh Forest Park, housing Aero Club Minsk and Minsk Aviation Museum.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIt has about 451 kindergartens, 241 schools, 22 further education colleges, and 29 higher education institutions, including 12 major national universities.\n\n\n=== Major higher educational institutions ===\nAcademy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

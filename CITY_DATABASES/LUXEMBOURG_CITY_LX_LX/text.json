        "wiki": "The Bock (Luxembourgish: Bockfiels) is a promontory in the north-eastern corner of Luxembourg City's old historical district. Offering a natural fortification, its rocky cliffs tower above the River Alzette which surrounds it on three sides. It was here that Count Siegfried built his Castle of Lucilinburhuc in 963, providing a basis for the development of the town which became Luxembourg. Over the centuries, the Bock and the surrounding defences were reinforced, attacked and rebuilt time and time again as the armies of the Burgundians, Habsburgs, Spaniards, Prussians and French vied for victory over one of Europe's most strategic strongholds, the Fortress of Luxembourg. Warring did not stop until the Treaty of London was signed in 1867, calling for the demolition of the fortifications. Ruins of the old castle and the vast underground system of passages and galleries known as the casemates continue to be a major tourist attraction.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n    \nIt was in 963 that Count Siegfried, in search of a site from which he could defend his properties, obtained the Bock and its surroundings from St Maximin's Abbey in Trier in exchange for the land he owned at Feulen in the Ardennes to the north. The Romans, then the Franks, had probably already inhabited the Bock although there is only scant archeological evidence of their presence. There are however traces of a 4th-century Roman watchtower close to the point in the Fish Market where two major Roman roads used to cross, one from Reims to Trier and the other from Metz to Li\u00e8ge.\n\nThe first historical mention of the Bock is indeed in connection with a watchtower or fortification on the Roman road from Reims to Trier  which, in 723, was ceded by Charles Martel, Duke of the Franks, to the Abbey of St Maximin in Trier. Two centuries later, Count Siegfried, who had properties \"in Feulen, Hosingen and Monnerich in the Pagus Wabrensis, in Sarreburg, Berncastel and Roussy in the Pagus Mosellanus\", was looking for a location for a castle able to withstand any onslaught which would serve as a central point for his holdings. After failing to obtain a site near the Abbey of Stavelot, now in the Belgian province of Li\u00e8ge, he approached the Abbot of St Maximin's for the purchase of the property high up on the Bock cliff above the Alzette River, described as a \"castle by name Lucilinburhuc\" (castellum quod dicitur Lucilinburhuc). It therefore seems as if there was already a castle on the site before Siegfried became interested in it and that it was not Siegfried who called it Lucilinburhuc. After the consent of Emperor Otto I had been obtained, the deed was signed by Viker, Abbot of St Maximin's, on 7 April 963. Siegfried acquired the site in exchange for some of his properties at Feulen.\n\nOver the centuries, Siegfried's fortified castle on the Bock was considerably enlarged and protected with additional walls and defences. In 987, the castle chapel was built at the nearby Fish Market. Today's St Michael's Church stands on the same site.  Under Conrad I, the castle became the residence of the Counts of Luxembourg. It was damaged, destroyed, captured and rebuilt on several occasions as the Burgundians (1473), the Habsburgs (1477), and the Spaniards (1555) attacked and took the fortress.As time passed, the fortifications needed to be adapted to new methods of war based on increasingly strong firepower. During the 1640s under the Spaniards, the Swiss engineer Isaac von Treybach significantly reworked the defences. The Bock was also strengthened with three forts, the Large Bock, Middle Bock and Small Bock (from west to east), separated from each other by cuts in the rock and linked by bridges. As a result, little remained of the medieval castle.A little later in 1684, on behalf of Louis XIV, Vauban succeeded in capturing the city of Luxembourg during a month-long siege under which the Bock fortifications were completely flattened. Thereafter Vauban, perhaps the most competent fortification engineer of his day, undertook major additions to the defences, realizing that underground passages and chambers were just as important as the surface installations. The Large Bock, connected to the old town by the Pont du Ch\u00e2teau, was further reinforced. Enclosed by a wall 12 m (39 ft) high, it was the major component of the new fortress.\n\nIn addition to these structures, the Bock also included a system of casemates which originated in the cellars of the medieval castle. In 1744, during the Austrian period, these underground passages were considerably enlarged by General Neipperg. The main passage. which still remains, is 110 m long and up to 7 m wide. Branches leading off on either side were equipped with no less than 25 cannon slots, 12 to the north and 13 to the south, offering considerable firepower. In the event of war, the Bock casemates, covering an area of 1,100 m2, could be used as barracks for several hundred soldiers. Water was supplied from a well 47 m deep.Thanks to its defences, in 1794 during the French Revolutionary Wars, the city held out against a French siege for seven months. When the garrison finally surrendered, the walls were still unbreached. This led the French politician and engineer Lazare Carnot to call the Luxembourg fortress \"the best in the world, apart from Gibraltar\". As a result, it has often been called the Gibraltar of the North.\nThe fortifications were finally demolished under the terms of the Treaty of London in 1867. The demolition took 16 years and cost the enormous sum of 1.5 million gold francs.\n\n\n== Pont du ch\u00e2teau ==\n\nThe two-storey bridge connecting the Bock to the old town was an important component of the fortifications. Technically, it is a rather curious structure. Built in 1735 by the Austrians, it provides no less than four ways of crossing between the cliffs: the road over the top, a passage by way of the four upper arches, a spiral staircase up through the main arch and a tunnel under the road at the bottom.\n\n\n== Famous visitors ==\nOver the years, the Bock casemates have received several famous visitors. These include:\n\nEmperor Joseph II of Austria (1781);\nNapoleon Bonaparte (1804);\nPrince Henry of the Netherlands (1868);\nGrand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg (1936);\nGrand Duke Henri of Luxembourg and his wife Grand Duchess Maria Teresa (2000).\n\n\n== The legend of Melusina ==\nThere have reportedly been people that have seen Melusine in the waters nearby.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLuxembourg City\nHistory of Luxembourg\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "I loved that place! Amaizing views at any direction you turn your head! I was there standing about two hours and watching the incredible view from casamate..Honestly I didn't want to leave! I love this great locations, is quiet but it got too much to show! I will definitely return back!",
          "Lovely place. Enjoyable nature in the modern city",
          "This world Heritage site was very very impressive!\nThe tunnels are very expansive and go on for quite a bit!\nBe prepared to duck, crouch, and potentially get lost!\nBring comfortable shoes and be ready to get comfortable with low lighting.\nAwesome experience and lots of facts on the wall to learn!",
          "A real beautiful historic sight, Unique place. This World Heritage site was very very impressive! Nicely organized, This is priceless to see. Peace and Nature with great ancient architectural significance,  definitely worth a visit.",
          "A great part of a city walk through Luxembourg. Excellent maintained, though some steeper parts are necessary to traverse, generally it easy to do.\n\nLast time was about 13 years ago. The only difference is what part is being restored. In \u2026",
          "Historical part of the city with a very nice walkable tour aournd the Casemates.",
          "We were very sad to learn these were closed to the public due to renovations when we visited. Nevertheless they looked very cool from the outside and we will definitely come back sometime to explore the interior.",
          "Very cool to explore all the nooks and crannies.  If you find an open door with a narrow staircase, just go for it and see where it ends up.  Good job with added safety lighting and handrails that don't detract from the historic character.",
          "It\u2019s something to do in Luxembourg and it\u2019s a heritage site too. I felt that once you have seen the view from both sides, you have pretty much seen it at that point - was just underground tunnels with openings on each side (so imagine it\u2019s \u2026",
          "It's a good place to visit while in Luxembourg city on a not so good day. About 7\u20ac entrance fee and you can explore the vast complex of underground tunnels & galleries, begun in 1644 & used as WWII bomb shelters. Worth a visit if you in the area.",
          "Quite interesting, but hard to know where to go. We almost missed a staircase leading to a whole extra floor and saw at least one other couple standing around wondering where to go (we showed them to the staircase). All in we saw everything in about half an hour, which seemed quite quick, wonder if we missed anything.",
          "The casemates in Luxembourg are an underground network of corridors and caves that were built for defensive purposes from the 17th century onwards. It contributed to making Luxembourg one of the best fortified cities in Europe. The \u2026",
          "Very impressive historical place",
          "Pro tip: If you are in Luxembourg city on a rainy day, then visiting the caves would probably be the best thing you could do!\n\nI was here on (19.10.19) with my mum and a friend and the caves which is an UNESCO heritage site is surely the \u2026",
          "Great to look at, but unfortunately it isn't opened during the winter.",
          "Very nice! Didn\u2019t had time to go inside, but the view already was worth to go there. We will definitely come again an check the city and the casematten out again! We would love to discover it, i wonder how much of the suppose to exist and left 17km of underground is possible to access ? I love to find out ;)",
          "Fine but don't expect anything magical. You pay \u20ac7 euros to walk around underground for as long as you want but that is it really. There's no info or anything else to look at. There are some lookout points where you can see nice views, but it's just similar looking corridors. I spent about 30 mins down there.",
          "The casements were boring and the information boards were not in English making it a waste of time to visit.\nI would suggest paying the extra and joining a guided tour as these are provided in English if you wanted to visit this world heritage site.\nPersonally I would suggest spending the time visiting other areas of the city.",
          "Very beautiful place \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Not the first time we have been here but it\u2019s been 10 years. It hasn\u2019t changed. Great time exploring the tunnels. Kids had fun and it was a relief on a hot day to be inside and cool. Get a map though. Not hard to get lost but to know u went everywhere. It\u2019s a walk so wear comfortable shoes and watch ur step",
          "Luxembourg is very beautiful city. I have amazing time there",
          "Lovely place, shame it's not open in integraty. It's meant to be over 20 km of corridors, but you can only visit 1km.\nLovely views of Luxembourg and interesting to imagine how it could've been used as shelter",
          "Good place to spend an hour.. Mostly walk around to different balconies and few narrow stairs and closed areas. Careful not to get lost.",
          "You need to visit this amazing historic place. Here you will find something which is really carved in stone ;-). In hot summer, even a good place to calm down. Recommendation: Could be an option to buy the Luxembourg card at the Tourist information. Entry fee, public transport and other attractions are included.",
          "While driving back to Germany from Brussels, I decided to take a pit stop in Luxembourg for lunch.  With only a couple hours to spend in town before getting back on the road I decided to take a tour of the Casements.  This is a great \u2026",
          "Nicely organized, definitely worth a visit. Nice walking inside the fortifications. Some spots with nice view but nothing extraordinary.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our walk around all of Luxembourg City including the casements and municipal park. One of the nicest, cleanest cities in our entire European trip",
          "Beautiful views of the city. Great place for amazing photos. You can park in the theater parking garage and walk for few minutes ( and hour or 2 for 4 euros). There is a part outside that is free and if you want to go inside it\u2019s 7 euros \u2026",
          "Fun but could have more history, more explanations, something... This way it is just a nice walk inside a mountain, when it could be a full historical experience",
          "Interesting place and nice view over the city... It is mandatory to visit this place if you are in Luxembourg...Enjoy it! \ud83d\ude0a",
          "A real beautiful historic sight. This is priceless to see. Visit, close your eyes and imagine what life was like.",
          "Perhaps the most historical place of Luxembourg.\n(If you don't have GPS there is not to much signals saying \"Casemates du Bock\".\nThis place is the rest of the fortification that sorrounded the old village of Luxembourg.\nEvery view point has \u2026",
          "The Casemates were a pleasant surprise and dug into the hills surrounding the city. Prior to the visit I didn\u2019t know about the Casemates prior to coming to Luxembourg City. In addition to the intricate tunnel system, the views were fantastic. They do have seasonal hours so be forewarned.",
          "It is really full with nice places wben that it was raining",
          "It was an amazing experience and worth the visit. We even got the coin souvenir and it was so pretty and shiny. I definitely recommend this to visit if you are in luxembourg because this is the gateway to learn more about their past and \u2026",
          "Great price. The tunnels are stunning, be careful if you are tall though as you'll easily hit your head!\n\nIncredible views too!",
          "Not too pricey with only 7 euros for entrance and the tunnels are amazing to walk through (and nice and cold on a hot day). The only thing I missed was some more information (English would be a great addition). Also the lighting in some places was not great.",
          "Beautiful. They are as if they are from a fairytale.",
          "Such a beautiful place! The view is just like a fairy tail world. The cute houses with grey blue roof, the river carries the romantic atmosphere. In spring all the flowers are blooming, which bring bright colors to this place. Love it!",
          "This is an interesting place to walk through. With the Luxembourg card it was free but if we had paid the regular entrance fee, which think is $15EU I would have been very disappointed. Feel they could do a better job with signage so you can easily make your way around. You just kind of wander around without knowing where to go next.",
          "it is UNESCO heritage of 17 k.m. long tunnel with an amazing view. The ticket was 7 EUR per person for the tunnels. It is not wheelchair or pram friendly.The tunnels had interesting spots inside about where people hid themselves. They can \u2026",
          "It was cool, but very repetitive. We went down a staircase that brought us down, around, across, and right back up on the other side of the wall we went down. Also a spot for couples to find private corners to make out in. Views were decent, but you can see the same things without paying from above.",
          "I really recommend visiting the Casemates because it's a very nice experience. The panoramic views are amazing. The tunnels are illuminated and very easy to use. It's safe also for visiting with kids. They don't give you a map for the \u2026",
          "Even without paying the entrance fee and going inside the walls, there is a lot to see just by walking around the ramparts and looking at the plaques. The info is in French  and German, though. Amazing views of the Grund and other ancient parts of the city and its bridges.",
          "Nice visit, but it's difficult to navigate all the sections because there aren't clear signs and direction arrows. You'd expect it to be better organized and maintained for the \u20ac7 entrance fee they're charging.",
          "One of most interesting places in Luxembourg, to visit. Many caves and long tunnels drilled in bare rock. Very nice views from inside.",
          "An interesting place to see if you are visiting Luxembourg. I still go there once in a while at night to just sit and enjoy the view of the old town",
          "A nice place to visit! It doesn\u2019t look so bug from outside, but its totally a surprise inside! The views are pretty cool from inside! Specially the narrow staircases from the olden days are a bit adventurous!",
          "Very interesting! It was a bit busy, so sometimes we had to wait to look at a view or something. You might consider doing the guided tour, there isn't much information in the Kazematten if you walk trough yourself.",
          "Excellent experience with kids, to see the history of the cliffs and castle, but to be able to explore, wander around and see the city from a different view.",
          "Nice and cool place to explore. Interesting part of the city's history.  Be sure to pick up the brochure by the ticket booth if you want information about each part of the casemates.",
          "Peace, Calmness and Nature with great ancient architectural significance.  Lovely place to visit",
          "I would love to give this place the full five stars that it deserves, but it is under construction, so if someone is planning a trip mainly to see this attraction they should consider this.\n\nA good deal of the structure is not accessible \u2026",
          "It's an amazing piece of history, I would recommend trying the guided tour in order to have a better experience",
          "The price of 7 euro is too expensive for what you get in return. The lack of signs makes it difficult to find your way through the tunnels and understand the history of the place. The whole sight can be visited in about 30 minutes. If you have seen castles before, it is not really worth visiting.",
          "I recommend that you get a ticket and visit the undergrounds. This is a three-dimensional maze made in a Mountain. Fun experience!",
          "There are nice views from balconies and cannon holes. The place is badly signed though so we had to circle back a few times. Not much description either.\nOn the plus side, I enjoyed colourful lights installed in the caves.",
          "One of nicest spots to go for a drink near the palace and with nice preserved old town style. You will also find a free museum nearby, an amazing view to grund. Check also the caves during spring or summer.",
          "You have to pay to go inside and it\u2019s a tad overpriced. The passages might be fun for kids to explore but otherwise it\u2019s a bit cramped and repetitive. You can get the idea from the outside without going on. That\u2019s where the great views are anyway.",
          "One more heritage place... What mesmerizes is the restoration, preservation of the age old structures.... Excellent efforts by Luxembourg government and UNICEF",
          "A sneak peak literally down the history of this beautiful place called Luxembourg",
          "Incredible views within and toward outside. Exhausting to walk but totally worth it. I would go again.",
          "Unique place, even more beautiful by night and when it snows",
          "A great way to walk in the history of this beautiful city. You can get wonderful views from the Casemates of Luxembourg City. There could be clearer signage for easier navigation. Definitely take one of the info leaflets to help you get around!",
          "Dungeons under the city of Luxembourg. Nice thing to see and enjoy the view on the whole Luxembourg. In shooting points You will find cannons, nice to take a picture of yourself with them.",
          "Great place to visit. But lot to walk if you want to enjoy the beauty.",
          "Really nice place to explore the history of Luxembourg. The entrance fee is 7e per adult and cash only. I had to go to ATM and the closest one is quite an uphill walk away so be sure not to do the same mistake.",
          "You can discover some cool caves, kind of a mini maze too ! Should check out if interested in history of the place. Also offers some cool views of city ! The whole trip only takes 30mins inside caves.",
          "Interesting tunnels for a reasonable price. Not recommended if you have claustrophobia or if you aren't very mobile because there is a tight spiral staircase, dark areas with uneven ground and thing corridors. \nGood views of the city from \u2026",
          "No comment. Must visit. No dogs allowed. So we didn't. But we understand. Great environment. Good place to walk downtown.",
          "I only had a day in Luxembourg.  This is an easy walk from the train station and was a great experience.  Note- need cash for entry.",
          "The views from going under here are very similar to the views from the top of the museum which is free. Paid zero as had Luxembourg card but would have been disappointed if I'd paid 7 euros for a small exhibit and entrance to dungeon with windows out showing the same 2 view points.",
          "A bit pricy,  not much to see minus the view.",
          "Nice walk across the Wenzel path led us besides these huge defensive structures. Highly recommended, but beware the steep climbs.",
          "Great place to wander and explore! Not too crowded (we got there pretty early). Great for all ages, but be ready to walk and climb up and down stairs.",
          "This site offers amazing views, a must see when in Luxembourg City. The casemates aren't open all the time, but there's plenty to see even when closed. The river valley is beautiful with flowering trees, an open vista and the classic architecture. It's also an easy walk from the city center.",
          "It is the first underground tunnels built in 1644, in the era of the Spanish domination.40 years later they were enlarged by the French military, and in the eighteenth century by the Austrians. It was great to know more information.",
          "Must visit at Luxembourg. \n\nHistory:\n\nIn 963, Count Siegfried built a fortified castle on the Bock promontory, which was soon to become the cradle of the city. In the course of the centuries, on the western side, mighty ring walls were \u2026",
          "A great labyrinth, perfect for young explorers but not too much by w\u00e0y of historical context is provided. I'm sure there must be a wealth of stories about the casements over the centuries ?",
          "Is always a pleasure to walk along this big walls, is relaxing and peaceful.Is fully worth his UNESCO title.Is better to visit this during the autumn or before the summer as this could become crowded",
          "Interesting enough place to visit and see.  Not a lot of information is given about it though.  I learned more about it from Google and Wikipedia.",
          "Amazing history. Lots to explore. Be prepared for many stairs, cool temperatures, and some very narrow passageways. Some incredible views of the city below from the archways of the labyrinth. Definitely worth the bit of cardio.",
          "Beautiful old walls and fortress, it's only been open to the public since the 1930's and had been used in WWll as a bomb shelter for up to 35'000 people! This capital is one of my favourite cities in Europe! Absolutely stunning, like you are walking around in a storybook...",
          "Awesome place to explore in Luxembourg. Works you legs out for a good sit down dinner!",
          "Really worth it! .. But not if you are claustrophobic",
          "Quite a fun time with the family. Great views outside and cool caverns inside. Put it on your list.",
          "Very interesting, affordable and great views of the city. Lots of stairs however so just a heads up. Worth doing for sure.",
          "Must visit when in Luxembourg. WWII bunkers",
          "Like taking a trip back in time! Enjoyed walking through it, amazing views, history is all around you here:)",
          "It was really fun and bit confused. But we should have stamina to walk around the cave! It was like a puzzle.",
          "Super cool area, I would recommend just visiting and exploring all the free areas. Very nice, so no need to pay",
          "Super awesome, enjoyed my cigar looking at historical yet modern view... booked  guided tour the next day",
          "7 euros per person to enter but totally worth it. Really unique experience to wander around the casemates and you get a lot of nice views of the city too.",
          "Beautiful place.. underground ruins are really amazing to visit.. feels like a maze.. a must visit ofcorse for anyone visiting Luxembourg City.",

          "Really nice! Definitely should walk around and visit this place in Luxemberg!",
          "Very impressive to see and experience. The history of how the people defended luxembourg in the past is very interesting. The tour guide was a bit boring but a very nice and wonderful man. The people of luxembourg are very proud of their heritage and culture.",
          "We had not really planned to visit Luxembourg, but are very glad we did. Lots to see and do, very prosperous, just shows what low tax does for your economy. Some wonderful public spaces and facilities.",
          "We took out two girls (3 & 5 years old) into the caves. They loved it the excitement of exploring what\u2019s next or down the steep spiral staircases was a great adventure. \n\nThe leaflet issued to you as you pay is good but there could be a \u2026",
          "Interesting history. Good views. Worth a visit if you have extra time on your hands",
          "The interpretive signage is not in English sadly but there is a small pamphlet in English that guides you through the interior nicely. It\u2019s a very interesting tour within for both the history as well as the amazing panoramic views. I would definitely recommend it.",
          "Old castle of Luxembourg . Nice and interesting experience through the casemates and tunnels .",
          "I advise to take the guided tour (even as a Luxembourger, I learned plenty of stuff) !",

          "A great view to take some good pictures",
          "The best place I have seen in all my travels around Luxembourg. It's wonderful every corner you can visit and you can take very nice pictures from the 4 different facades. Is a must if you visit the country. Don't forget it or you'll miss \u2026",
          "One of the very few places to visit in the city of Luxembourg. \nThe Luxembourg city doesn't have spoken many location to visit this one is worth the visit. \nThe place is very nice to have a visit. \nCassandra dude bock have few caves inside which looks beautiful and must visit with your kids. \nMust wear shoes \ud83d\udc5f",
          "Absolutely stunning. I'm very happy that we made the time for this attraction.",
          "To be honest, there\u2019s nothing in it, just a complex cave or a maze, but costs \u20ac7 per adult. I think it\u2019s not worth.",
          "Interesting with some nice views, but i did expect to see something more about the history. A bit expensive for what it is though",
          "No information given at the reception, everyone gets lost, no English maps or information. It is definitely too expensive (7\u20ac) for what it is. It is completely trash, it's a money grabing strategy",
          "Beautiful we went to luxembourg only for 1 day on our way to paris. Casemates du Bock I found on internet and really wanted to visit people say the entrance is hard to find but that is false! We found it immediately and when you ever are in Luxembourg it is worth a visit",
          "Interesting and quite impressive, there isn't much to see diversity wise.",
          "Lots of nice views, very informative and a nice play to go to get away from the heat on a sunny day.",
          "Useful information they should add on their website and description is that they only take cash, and that there is no nearby cash machine. For that reason, I wasn't able to enter and can only give it 1*.",
          "Its included in the Wenzel Walking Tour. So you may want to skip doing this on your own, if you're booking the tour.  It is a ticketed tour but the price also includes entry to Bock casemates.",
          "Excellent place to visit in Luxembourg city. Luxembourg city is not huge so not lots to see but this is one thing you should visit. It is a series of under ground tunnels and caves which were part of the original fortifications of the city \u2026",
          "Best place to cross from Grund to town",
          "Good view but thats all, a bit boring to be honest",
          "Lots of climbing up and down stairs. Great views. Do it if you have time and nothing else to do.",
          "Very beautiful views, nice historic spot. Adult tickets cost 7 euros. Very recommendable!",
          "The highlight maybe of my trip in Luxembourg!Amazing view down to the valley.You relax with the serendipity caused from the huge amount of green!You can get a lot of photos from above and after that enjoy a walk down to the Petrusse valley crossing short bridges,waterfalls and beautiful parks!Don't miss it!",
          "Must see if you visit Luxembourg. Interesting to explore",
          "So unique. I have never seen such a place like this.  It's a must place to see if in Luxembourg",
          "The Bock Casemates are more than a kilometer in length, and the most fulfilled cave is 110m x 7m. This fantastic complex of caves (which one day was 23 km long) made Luxembourg one day known as Gibraltar in the north.",
          "Lovely place to explore the Casemates. The kids loved going through the various caverns, but there are lots of stairs!\n\nWe probably covered it all in about 1hr, though as we had small children, we weren't able to go on a guided tour which I am sure would take longer.",
          "Lots of history to explore here. We had a guide for a couple of hours and well worth it.",
          "Was interesting but a lack of signage will frustrate how you get through it.",
          "Wanderful country we took bus tour from bruxell in Belgium.. To many wanderful areas.",
          "Interesting place to visit who like history. They are made in 17th century. It is a labyrinth in the rock what seems like was constructed as a shelter in case of a war.\nIt coasts 7\u20ac for adults to visit",
          "Good price at \u20ac7 to enter. It is literally a short stroll under Luxembourg in an area dug out in the 17th century to house canons. Other than that it's a rock face with viewing points. Lasts about 20 minutes.",
          "Very cool!  Definitely recommended.",
          "If Luxembourg becomes too hot for your liking, you can take refuge in these cold passageways for the generous price of 7\u20ac. Otherwise just a couple of scenic cave balconies. Three stars, one extra for the temperature.",
          "Interesting place to walk around. Make sure you get a brochure from the front because there are no other information markers throughout. The place is also cash only.",
          "very interesting",
          "This place is amazing and I am impressed by the way it has been looked after, after so many years.\n\nI was dissapointed to see that there weren't any English translations as with this I would have rated the visit \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",
          "It really  needs more explanation p\u00f3sters and better lights. Luxembourg landmark, do not miss a visit",
          "Amazing landscape. Great place for hiking.Lots of places to discover. Lots of parking lot around (not free)",
          "Interesting old fortress to explore well worth the 7euro. Has good views of the surrounding area.",
          "This place offers some great insight on the start of Luxembourg. Also a nice place for plane spotting. Look out for the majestic 747s and 777s ;)",
          "Great pice of Luxembourg history. Breathtaking views on old town.",
          "The historical point that is important for both eastern and Western European. Hence the castle was destructed in world war and everyone hope to capture this part as the defensive spot",
          "Probably it the best POI in Luxembourg, but I can't say, that casemats are amazing.",
          "7 EUR entrance fee - relatively cheap activity for Luxembourg",
          "Casemates of Bock in Luxemburg city, very nice and restaurated. You may combine with a lovely trip around the city center (old city) and the surroundings of Neum\u00fcnster",
          "Very nice piece of history with a great view over Luxembourg",
          "One of my favorite things about this city. Full of history and has beautiful views over the valley. I recommend taking the guided tour that happens in the spring till autumn.",
          "Historic fort for dating back to 965. Great views",
          "Wonderful place that takes you back several hundred years in history.",
          "If you like wandering around old tunnels this place is perfect. The tour is self guided so you're free to explore every nook and cranny as you please. Beautiful views of the city from every window.",
          "No option for zero stars. Because they wouldn't let me in. I walk with sticks and their rule is disabled people with walking aids are not allowed. I am perfectly able to navigate uneven surfaces and steep stairs but they would not leave it up to me. I will complain and hope they change the discriminatory policy.",
          "Lovely historical sight. When we visited there was a jazz band playing inside and it was amazing. Ensure you have a map when walking through the site as one area is a dead end and requires a long walk back.",
          "Interesting place to visit, quite spacious with many ins and outs to discover",
          "Our entry was included with the Luxembourg card, but if you pay it is well worth the money as we spent such a long time seeing almost everything (one section was closed). Make sure to pick up a map/guidebook at the front desk as there is no information as you go round. Well worth a visit!",
          "Amazing and breathtaking view! You can't leave the city without visit it. Check availability during the winter time.",
          "Nice historical place but need some maintenance",
          "The Casemates are a super cool place to visit, though it would likely be better in the summer when more of it is open. Great views of the city and river at any time though all of which are freely accessible.",
          "Awesome place to visit.great way to experience history... beautiful maintained and givee a out of world experience...",
          "Insane. So old so cool best thing we saw on our 20 day trip",
          "Probably the main attraction in the city, often called 'balcony of Europe'! It's a beautiful place to go to. You can walk through the trails and  centuries old tunnels. There are two lifts operating nearby, one of them with stunning view! \u2026",
          "Very picturesque place but there really isn't a lot to do around the area",
          "Nice and interesting place to see, not much more to it but if you find yourself in Luxembourg city you should visit this place.",
          "Visited this place with guide Alex and learned  lots of interesting facts about the history of Luxembourg. Can only recommend!",
          "Very cool historic defense works! I suggest to take the guided tour because we almost got lost! There's stairways and hallways into every direction so we didn't know where we had been or still had to go. The view is great out of each window \u2026",
          "Fascinating but Also the right place where to cool down when outside are 35 degrees.",
          "The climbing up and down can be a little strenuous but the photos were worth it. It's amazing the work that has been done to preserve architecture.",
          "We took a family trip to downtown Luxembourg to check out the ruins. We took the train from Wasserbillig. (Super affordable with the day fare for up to 5 people!) and enjoyed walking through the streets of Luxembourg. The castle was very \u2026",
          "Amazing history. Well maintained",
          "Very interesting to compare and contrast with the Casemates at the north east corner of Dover Castle",
          "Super cool place to explore. It is a must visit",
          "Great place to visit. Not expensive and very interesting.",
          "Good for a short visit. Its a network of underground tunnels.. It takes a little above an hour to enjoy the place.",
          "Beautifully maintained underground ruins. Tour comes with a booklet with details on different points of interest, but I found the path pretty confusing and had to do two circuits instead. There is also a guided tour available, though I \u2026",
          "Network of tunnels with great views. Lots of steep spiral steps and entrance not too obvious.",
          "Interesting caves underneath the battlements and ramparts around Luxembourg City. You\u2019ll need about half an hour to see them.",
          "Great caves and tunnel constructions. Don\u2019t miss the lower tunnel under the Bridge.",
          "Very nice, caves, nature all in a big city centre",
          "a journey through history! some nice spots for taking photos. entrance fee is reduced if you're a student. there are not many direction signs inside and you may get lost a little bit so don't forget to bring the map with you. also beware of the narrow and spiral staircases.",
          "Cool place to visit with some good views over the city",
          "Good to visit.. with a lot history!\nEntry price for adults 7 Euro.. free with Luxembourg card..\nFor children 4.5 Euro.. free for under 4 years old children",
          "Very interesting touristic activity to walk a path inside a very old fortress. You can do it really fast just to have a different sightseeing of the Luxembourg city from several windows, or taking your time to read all the information and \u2026",
          "Nice surrounding. A nice Irish pub.",
          "Nice for a private stroll with friends/partner. Otherwise uneventful and devoid of content.",
          "It's a absolutely beautiful place to be I highly recommend visiting",
          "Wonderful place to walk around and through. If you want to go inside, there is a fee. However there is plenty to see around and many different trails or paths to keep you busy. Very photogenic place and interesting.",
          "Impressive, good visit, even though the weather was not quite playing along",
          "This was really fun. A little hard to navigate though.",
          "Nice place to visit. Liked all the underground corridors.",
          "Interesting but I wish I'd done a guided tour because there wasn't much information provided. Nice to wander through but easy to get lost (and end up missing parts, or walking the same parts twice) which would be avoided on a tour",
          "nice caves ending on a beautiful city view",
          "This was excellent, but some may think it's not worth \u20ac7.",
          "Interesting network of tunnels which have provided shelter to Luxembourgers in time of need from wars and seiges to a recent heat wave.",
          "\ud83d\ude01",
          "Free to go and quite nice view of the small village below (didn\u2019t know how to get down there from the top tho)",
          "Wonderful place to be in.\nVery well maintained, best place to view the beauty of Luxembourg.\nRiver canal inbetween is next to perfect.\nIt all looks just like a painting.\nThere is a small bridge before entering the place, the view from there is just mind blowing.\nMust and must visit place in Luxembourg.",
          "Really amazing place, the view from each part of the cave Maze is a new discover",
          "We visited these caves thinking that could be more interesting than it actually was. The actual caves are a lot bigger that what if opened to the public. Is an ok stop to visit but you will not loose anything if you spend the time visiting the surroundings instead of the caves",
          "Huge fortress, but no English sign or explaination.",
          "Very unique site to visit, a little hard to follow the markers but that makes it all the more fun for exploring.",
          "Amazing place in lovely surroundings. Entrance cost about 6 euros so very reasonable. Recommended",
          "Interesting place to look around",
          "A must during your visit to Luxembourg, gives you a wonderful view of the old city",
          "Enjoy taking photos here.",
          "A must visit place... They don't take card so you need to get cash which is the sad part",
          "The former fortress of Luxembourg. You pay a \u20ac5 entry fee and are then left free to roam the caves. There is a small section of information on the history and then you can explore the rest for yourself. Looking out of the windows, you get \u2026",
          "Immered into something new. Not all the time you will see and be inside on a prison. Tour guide is very knowledgeable. Good place to visit! Book ahead of yime begore arriving!",
          "UNESCO heritage ... Good place to visit",
          "I wonder why they didnt free entry for this.",
          "Took the guided tour which cost extra. The tour guide Louis was very knowledgeable and able to answer questions. They offer Geman/English tour twice daily and French/English once daily. \nHowever, the front desk was a bit rude. \n\nThe fort \u2026",
          "A must see for any visitor, a little dark and cold, and please not for people with knee problems.",
          "Fantastic viewpoint with even its own photo point. The view from the top was fantastic to look at the lower points of Luxembourg. Didnt go in because of time reasons but would recommend visiting it for the scenery.",
          "An awesome experience. The history is incredible.",
          "It was indeed, like it said, a lot of stairs. And the route could become confusing at some points. But we wandered of the regular route.",
          "This was absolutely incredible to see! Well worth the 6 euros! They had a piece of it closed off for construction but still worth it even without that section!",
          "Worth it to see as it gives insight into the history of Luxembourg.",
          "Nice views from the site. Exciting for the kids.",
          "Nice place to visit and see the history, if you have a booklet or a guide. Inside there is no information about what you are seeing or where to go. Would be a wonderful sightseeing visit if more was done to help visitors understand.",
          "Since I am a native Luxembourger I have been here multiple times. Of course it becomes boring when you visit it too often. \n\nHowever, visiting it every few years is amazing and visiting it for the very first time even more so. You van actually experience a bit of history.\n\nJust be careful as the steps can be very narrow.",
          "Major tourist attraction in Luxembourg City, iportant part of this capital's history.",
          "Signage could be better, but very interesting walk through.",
          "Truly an impressive historical place. This place radiates energy from the past. Very beautiful",
          "One world heritage in kuxemburg",
          "Beautiful views and a reasonably informative narrative (On the train). Could do with stopping at the more interesting locations to take pictures.",
          "Very beautiful and educational but 7\u20ac for the entrance fee it\u2019s excessive! At the end we didn\u2019t go in because we thought it\u2019s not fair for them to charge the same amount for a cave than for the whole gorgeous Vianden castle.",
          "It\u2019s not very overwhelming but given that it\u2019s one of the few attractions in the city, one can spend a good half an hour in the underground fort. Not too far from the central station and the ticket comes for 6euros(5 for students).",
          "Fantastic views of the river valley. Tour is loosely organised, you find your way around in an organic way. Very interesting but nothing in English on the history boards so a bit limiting for my party. Wikipedia gives a good potted script worth a read. Definitely worth the visit. Approx \u20ac8/adult entry.",
          "Is fun, quite a labyrinth \ud83d\ude00",
          "This is a great place you need to visit in Luxembourg, especially in summer, you can hide here for a little bit from the heat outside.\nGreat city views on the lower City and Alzette river.\nPrice to enter: 7 euros, adult",
          "History we should know. A great learning",
          "This is a pretty cool place. Not to recommend if you have a bad knee of hip or similar. I cannot image anybody having fun in there with a wheelchair \u2013 at least as far as all the stair cases are concerned. (There are bathrooms that should be \u2026",
          "If you're in Luxembourg...and you don't know what to do...and it's raining...this is the right place.",
          "Really cool area.",
          "A must see when you visit Luxembourg, but that is mostly because there isn't that much to do in Luxembourg city. Although the casemates might be kilometers in length throughout the city, this part is only 100-200m long. There isn't much \u2026",
          "Cash only. Literally the only time I would have had to withdraw cash. Apparently this place is still stuck in the Middle Ages.",
          "Very impressive defenses both natural and man made.  Gives insight to Luxembourg's long safe history.  Very cool.",
          "Very stunning view a little but off the beaten track. Highly recommend if you like nice views and little peaceful towns.",
          "Really cool tour inside the rock!",
          "Best turist place of Luxembourg. Highly recommended.",
          "Nice experience. Most of the ruin are merely  tunnels leading to dead ends. The view however, from the holes in the wall are a spectacle. Only \u20ac6 entry so it was decent",
          "So fascinating! I thoroughly enjoyed it",
          "Nice if you like history and can understand what must have gone into building this. Some narrow staircases. Unfortunately very \"touristy\" dressed (spots, many signs etc...) However in some spots you do feel you are exploring and curiosity \u2026",
          "It's a must go location when in Luxembourg city.\n\nCost 7euro to get in filled with network of tunnels.",
          "We had a wonderful day exploring the castemates and surrounding area, which is very close to the centre of town. \n\nBe prepared for some walking up and down, but the views are amazingly beautiful.",
          "Fun/very historical Luxembourg landmark all should visit.  Gave only 3 because, altho one doesn't want history marred by directional signs, the \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0fsigns for very narrow stairs need to be easier to see/ID.  The brochure map could be a bit clearer as to to where EXIT is.  Otherwise, great experience!  Thx!",
          "Nice view, must seen if you are here",
          "It was a good place as early morning it was too cold and felt warm inside. It was hidden and secret place.",
          "Take note that they're not open during winter. Check the official website for dates. Even if it's not open, you can explore around to get some pretty good views. It's amazing how integrated the casemates are with the city. Will definitely visit again.",
          "I didn't have a chance to visit the site but by the looks of its surrounding area, it should be amazing",
          "One of the main attractions of the city, a very nice place to visit and to work out after a good lunch. There are trails and tunnels into the rock. They give you a map with the rooms and tunnels but the drawing it\u2019s not helpful. From its balconies there are some great views of the city.",
          "Very nice place.",
          "It's very nice place. Don't miss it. And take map agenda before entering into tannul \ud83d\ude0a. It too confusing place. You can't come out easily. I enjoyed very lot.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude0a",
          "I rarely give places one star. The reason for this is because I didn't even have the opportunity to try anything. We walked in, took a little bit to be seated. After being seated no one brought us menus or said anything to us. We waited \u2026",
          "Just fantastic views!",
          "A cultural heritage of Luxembourg that is worth a visit!",
          "It is okay, not too much to see and do except for a few viewpoints and some renovated rubble. The viewpoint on top is free and is even better. \nFor younger kids this is not a recommendation! They will get very bored and there is nothing to entertain them with here :(\n\nWhat I do recommend is walk beneath one of the bridges, way cooler!",
          "Be aware the place is closed for long periods. My kids were very disappointed. Open in Spring?!",
          "Love the experience, although the place is not that big and the entrance hard to find",
          "Amazing place to visit... great views",
          "Definitely not the coolest thing we saw in the city. Perhaps would've been better with a guide. Excellent views though.",
          "Very interesting place to see. Might be a bit triggering for those with claustrophobia in some places but there is a nice view on the city from that point. I'm giving 4/5 for the price to quality ratio. Overall, good experience and would recommend it to others visiting Luxembourg.",
          "Neverending ways and corners, very interesting",
          "This is a special attraction because of the historic importance, but is quite disappointing. It was recognized as UNESCO world heritage site was built first in 1644 and is stretched 23 km long. Actually this is an underground fortress used \u2026",
          "A view across the valley is absolutely a must for any tourist. Steeped in history this is the ultimate place to stretch your legs and do a bit of a walkabout. I do envy the people who actually live in this valley.",
          "I am not satisfied with the visit, I expected something more than just galleries to walk through. Although, the sights are amazing you can enjoy them from the top of the bridge. Therefore, in my opinion a 7 euros ticket is expensive",
          "The tunnels were closed when I was there but the fall colors were lovely and the green spaces wonderful.",
          "Fun for 30mins.  But no exhibition.  Just a few windows to look out from",
          "Beautiful place with beautiful views. A lot of history hidden under. A must visit place in Luxembourg. Would have been more better if it had an audio tour.",
          "Nice panoramic view of the river surrounding  Luxembourg. The casemates were closed however...",
          "Easily located via buses going in and out of the centre.\n\nBit on the pricey side but it's Luxembourg so it's to be expected.\n\nGet here early in the day to avoid school groups.\n\nBeautiful views of the valley below and amazing landscapes.",
          "They charge 6 Euros for entry, and for the first 10 minutes it's interesting. All you see is the same view without anything interesting in the actual cave part. Don't recommend it",
          "A very easily accessible piece of history!",
          "The view in this place is breathtaking. A perfect spot of a love story in the making \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Very impressive tunnel circuits.",
          "This is a 'must visit' place in Luxembourg. Ticket price is \u20ac6. Place is awesome. Read a bit before going. Guided tour would have been better, but I didn't see any guide around.",
          "Nice to see but could be done better. (The guys in Maastricht, for example, do know how to present this sort of stuff.)\n\nGood views though!",
          "Certainly go here if your are in town!",
          "Alot bigger then I thought it would be.",
          "Fascinating! Try to catch a tour. If not, take a tour by yourself. History is incredible.",
          "Such a nice heritage centre must watch once in ur lyf tym",
          "Interesting spot, great views into the valley.",
          "It's not worth 6 euro's to be honest",
          "Very interesting place where you can make many photos",
          "A very interesting tourist attraction. It looks like just a dungeon in the mountains at the first sight. However, once you start exploring it, it becomes more and more interesting. In addition, it is also quite a good workout if you truly explored every corner of the site.",
          "I didn't go inside the tunnels but looks amazing from the outside so much history.",
          "Nice place..  Relaxed..  Green..",
          "Incredible view of the city! Lots of small streets and a different perspective of the valle on each corner.",
          "A Warren of tunnels and stairs cases hidden inside a wall what more can I say if you love exploring and history then why are you reading this and not in the queue to get in !",
          "Pretty cool place. We didn't do a guided tour but wished we had.  Not for anyone with claustrophobia.",
          "It's cool but gets repetitive. Too many dead ends.",
          "Not a lot of information on display and pretty much all the same. Tunnels and firing holes dug out of rock.",
          "Its a very beautiful place",
          "This was amazing, tunnelled to protect the city",
          "Super cool and historical.",
          "It's quite lovely nice & beautiful casement du bock is a place I recommend",
          "nice view place for sighting. It's a beautiful hilly city and needs lots of climbing...",
          "Cool place to ponder",
          "It's very interesting place to visit in the city centre. However you cannot go with the pram. And they should add more historic items to create better atmosphere",
          "An incredible historical journey.",
          "It's got all the charm of a bunker, with the stunning view of a watch tower. No wonder the Spaniards commissioned its construction in the 17th century.\nNot recommended to people with weak knees, this place has a lot of stairs.",
          "It is very nice to see in here.",
          "Interesting spot, way bigger than expected from outside. I really recommend it.",
          "Excellent cave system to explore",
          "Really neat place with lots of tunnels to explore. I wish there was a bit more explanation of what the various tunnels and chambers were used for, though. Cheap entry fee with historical info in German and French.",
          "loved the place \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "Amazing tunnels through the rock in Luxembourg. Very cheap and definitely worth the money. There's a huge length of tunnel and many viewing spots. Some parts are very deep and dark. You have to be careful when you go down a staircase because some are very long and seem to never end!",
          "Nice leisure activity in Luxembourg!",
          "Absolutely stunning views from a historical site that gives panoramic aspects of the Duchy.",

There are tunnels towards the end that might make you a little claustrophobic and there are stairs that are so slanted that you will easily slip. Views are very scenic and walking the tunnels catapults you back in time.",

          "It is nice to see history of Luxembourg yet it is only caves that was used in the old days. I am thinking of the caves and the graphics in the Cappadocia. This is not even close. But if you are in town you can spend an hour at most for photo taking in the low illimunated alleys.",
          "Definitely worth a visit! Came across this area and was blown away with the beauty of the area and the history behind it",
          "This site was along circular walk, only site that charged a fee for entry (7E). We paid and toured this site. Was a great choice! We thought it was very interesting and really enjoyed touring the old fortress with all its rooms, awesome views and cannons for protection. There",
          "Cool experience but would not recommend for older visitors who have trouble balancing or climbing stairs. The stairwell going down towards the exit gets steep and narrow towards the end and may pose a safety hazard for them.",
          "The casemates are interesting and worth a visit. Note that you have to have cash, they do not accept card. The signage could be better, we got lost a couple of times and followed some other people down some dead ends. It\u2019s quite dark and the floor is uneven. The views of",
          "A good hour should be spent here. Unfortunately there is little info provided about it and none provided in any languages other than German and French which isn\u2019t great for a tourist destination. Luxembourg doesn\u2019t seem to quite recognise this as a potentially large tourist",
          "Free with Lux Card. Easy to walk to if staying in central hotels. There are some nice views from there and some canons to take photos of. Watch out for the v steep and badly lit stairs. Try and avoid having a big bag with you.",
          "So there isn't much information about or anyone to talk to, but you can get a small info leaflet when you get your tickets, 7 euro each. It's not necessarily easy to find but we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Great place to get photos of the city as well. Take your time, there's",
          "This is a must visit when in Luxembourg, as it is something that makes the city quite unique. So much history has passed within these natural walls. Very interesting.",
          "Just some caves. Was nice, but not a must. Was a lot of spiderweb there so watch out. Beutiful view from some areas.",
          "Went here to see if i could get some cool photos, and too se alot of Luxembourg city. It\u2019s definatly worth checking out but it\u2019s not a wow factor, you get to see the views outside there as well! But it\u2019s a cool way to see Luxembourg and its brick arctitecture. A ticket costs 7",
          "If you really want to get into the bowels of this city and explore its history, this is a good way to do it. As a bonus, you\u2019ll get some great views!",
          "Long queue to get in with only one ticket desk. Quite interesting about the history and some great views over the old city, but after a time it did become a little boring without sufficient variety in what we were experiencing. Not expensive to visit (\u20ac6 for seniors) and no",
          "It was interesting to explore the place - I went there with my friends and, in order to make the visit more fun, we imagined that we are knights ourselves and made different scenarios of action while walking/ running around! P.S. You should definitely bring cash when visiting",
          "The biggest issue with experiencing the Casemates du Bock is simply trying to find parking. We didn't plan well and just arrived in Luxembourg City without determining where to park to visit Casemates du Bock. After looking online we realized that parking was a common issue",
          "If you have been to one of this somewhere, you would be too existed about it. It is amazing and full of history, yet it's not really that fun to walk around. I did get a bit bored half way through it. Its locate in the city centre, so if you have time you may go and see it,",
          "Interesting to visit and only \u20ac6 for students! We were super tired though and kept getting lost or climbing stairs to find a dead end. We only stayed 20 minutes but I\u2019m sure if you explore a little longer you\u2019ll find it a bit more exciting- would probably recommend a guided",
          "There was a time when Luxembourg was a heavily defended city, a stronghold that was very difficult to conquer the Casemates du Bock a vestiges of those times - nowadays a tourist attraction.(like the Casemates of Petrusse - those were closed when we were in Luxembourg). So here",
          "These are elevated historic \u201ccaves\u201d in a mountain side overlooking the old town. They were built into the mountain side to help defend the city. Nice views but not much more.",
          "The casemates themselves are interesting, the views that open up are very nice. The student price is \u20ac6 and I think the regular entry costs \u20ac7.50 and I think that\u2019s quite a lot for what you get to see.",
          "Maybe it\u2019s because I was tired from our 22km hike the previous day but I didn\u2019t enjoy the casemates. There is no information inside and it\u2019s very same-y. There are nice views from the openings but you can see those without going into the casemates.",
          "I was very disappointed with my visit to the Casemates du Bock. There was very little to read. One room looked like another. It would have been much more interesting if there were signs to read and a tour that explained what you were looking at.",
          "Essentially just a network of tunnels through the rock. It is quite cool and some of the view points aren't bad but in my opinion they could do much more with it in terms of the information and history surrounding it, which would have made it much more interesting",
          "Good way to spend an hour. Don\u2019t expect anything too exciting as it is a lot of the same but it is still interesting to walk around and explore a place with so much history and at 7 eur isn\u2019t too expensive.",
          "My husband and I went here while in Luxembourg and had a great time exploring this tunnel system that was used to hide people during World War II. It also gives great views of Luxembourg. It's not the most handicapped friendly as it's dark and features a lot of dangerous steps.",
          "Just caves, you don\u2019t know where to go, they doesn\u2019t explain you anything at the entrance. The balcony isn\u2019t by far, the most beautiful in Europe... come on!",
          "If you have time you can do this ,nothing special. It's better to do it with a guide,or if you have time you can just walk if like walking.",
          "So basically these are tunnels inside a rock. Full stop. Nothing else. Oh yes, there are a couple of canons. Entry is 7 euro pp (cash only) for a short walk through the tunnels that have no description at all. Not much to see except the tunnels in the rock. Nothing else, no",
          "You really don't see much more going in that you do in the pictures shown here. It is just more of the same.",
          "If you're heading to Luxembourg City, you need to visit the catacombs. Very impressive from outside but very cool to see the different structures from within. There are a lot of steps and it is pretty dark, but worth the hour or so to walk around and see different vantage",
          "Honestly, this place did not really impress me. It's a personal opinion.For what you can visit, the entry price seems to me a little too high",
          "This is not pushchair friendly, we did a bit and then had to come back because there were too many steep stairs. My advice is to use a baby carrier. Stunning views and very interesting historical facts. Definitely one of the things to do when visiting Luxembourg but not",
          "This would not be everyone's idea of fun but I quite like things that are quirky and different. You enter the casements down a set of stairs and after paying the entry fee you are free to wander in the underground/in wall passages. There are some lovely views over the",
          "This is national history. Earliest records speak of of the year 953, i think Of course many places are shut and inaccessible to the public, but you get to see the parts with the best views of the city",
          "Bought a Luxembourg day pass and got complimentary access into the place, therefore i have no idea what the ticket price is. This place is like a collection of caves and it's cold even during spring time. Beautiful view from the viewing platforms! Absolutely worth running around",
          "Les casemattes is a thrilling location, just imagine soldiers being under siege in that dark, cold, and damp location! Good opportunity for photo shots of Luxembourg's Clausen and Grund quarters from the ramparts. Unfortunately missing the opportunity to providing any",
          "...but essential partof Luxembourg's history and good that they still remain. Much of the defensive city was removed a couple of hundred years ago.",
          "Interesting place to visit. Located in the underground .. several tunnels with different beautiful views...",
          "It was a lot of fun exploring the tunnels and peeking out over the valley. Casemates du Bock are a bit of a maze and the maps and signage weren't the most user friendly. However, it making it more interesting to explore. Recommend.",
          "Something that must be done in Luxembourg city. It is a good time spent walking around and looking out the viewpoints.",
          "Really cool area to walk around and explore. Lot's of history to indulge and stuff to learn. A good visit for bad weather days as well. Over a 1000 year of history and interesting to see the different use of the Bock in that time. We were here on a Monday morning and got lucky",
          "The Casemates were such a mystery! The caves hold a lot of history from medieval times to World War II. It was fun to climb around and explore.",
          "This is a really cool area to walk around. You can get a beautiful view of the city and walk around very old \u2018ruins\u2019 in the city. It was a lot of run to hike around the different parts of it.",
          "Worth dropping into see it. Wear comfortable shoes as it\u2019s uneven surface great views from both sides.",
          "These are so well preserved and there are rooms everywhere. There\u2019s also a few points that have tons of small and narrow stairs. If you dont like small spaces it will have difficulty with the stairs, skip them. There\u2019s so much more to see. We got some great pics overlooking the",
          "There is a fee and a senior discount. It is a maze of tunnels and small cavities, wear good shoes as it is uneven walking. Many of th things Niels lead to dead ends . You can\u2019t get lost but can end up backtracking. I would say no more than an hour would be sufficient to see all",
          "Absolutely a must do experience when in Luxembourg City. My assistant and I had our last day in the country scheduled for sightseeing before hopping on a flight later that night to head back to the states. We spent the whole day walking through every district of this",
          "I would recommend you go here... Beautiful sites of the old centre of Luxembourg. Its a lovely walk, but be aware some parts are not open on the weekend.",
          "Interesting to begin with but then got a bit repetitive and not very well navigated or explained even with the map/handout. I would recommend a visit due to the history of the city but does not need a long time spent there",
          "Allow a couple of hours to walk through the casemates, learn about their importance, history, and take some great photos from openings. At its height of operation, 35,000 people could be protected in this 23 km long cavern. Cannons fired from openings down the gorge could",
          "Try do the tour with the guide and you'll learn more about the place. Love to see the view from here.",
          "From Fortification built by Count Siegfried in 10th century become a tourist attraction, long story and history, attacked, rebuilt, and occupied by different armies after wars and wars to conqueror this stronghold, and then for the neutrality of Luxembourg the fort was destroyed",
          "You may think they\u2019re just some ruins but once you\u2019re there it is a great experience. It is a bit of a maze but the views are great",
          "Casemates du Bock has historical stories behind but currently it is going to convert into parking lots instead It overlooks the river Alzette and the structures below. The ruinsof he Lutzelburg fortress offer great views of the old city befre one explores passageways cut 130",
          "If you have some time over this valey has nice walking path in the valey of Alzette. From Casemates du Bock there is a gorgeous out-look over the valey and the Chirch Saint-Jean-du-Grund on the oposite side. Unfortunately Casemates du Bock has turned into a parking lot that",
          "We found these interesting, but confusing. Provided literature in English had limited information. Numbered signage difficult to find/see, therefore, nearly impossible to know where to turn. Perhaps better directional signage or a guide within the castmates would help visitors",
          "We found about the Casemates while we were in Luxembourg. They are a fascinating network of tunnels that have been part of the fortifications since I believe the 1600\u2019s. They are worth visiting to see what fortifications looked like so long ago, how they figured in the defence",
          "The Casemates du Bock are an essential tourist attraction in Luxembourg City. There are great viewpoints from the Casemates over the city. Aim to spend between 45 and 60 minutes here. Entrance is priced at 6\u20ac, or at no cost for holders of the Luxembourg Card.",
          "Historic well maintained bridge just outside the city centre, it is a UNESCO World Heritage site, also close to the old town",
          "Ultimately its the centre of old Luxembourg, the city that has survived the many attacks over ten centuries and lives on as a unesco world heritage site. Full of history, old buildings and interest. A must to visit.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the city of Luxembourgh and this is one of the highlights.It was a warm sunny day and the trees were in their autumn splendour.The view is magnificent.",
          "Casemates have different areas hat the guide divide in letters and try to be sure to visit them in order. Some of these caves are dead ends to the same or very similar views. Then, there are some hidden areas that go up or down stairs to new areas and if you cannot handle close",
          "We spent about 90 minutes here on a Sunday afternoon. There was no information in English once we were through the turnstile so make sure that when you buy your ticket (\u20ac6), you ask for the free brochure that provides at least some basic information and a map. I suggest you read",
          "Even though there isn't much to do inside, it is worth it paying the fee to check the caves. Not only because of what is inside, but also because of the views you can get from the city.",
          "It is interesting to see the casemates but if you dont go you will not be missing much. It is dark in some places and if you are claustrophobic I dont recommend it.",
          "This was such a fun walk through a maze of caves. Be sure to really explore each of the different areas; while some of them are dead ends to the same or very similar views, there are some hidden areas that go up or down stairs to new areas. That being said, some of the stairs",
          "The Bock Casemates are definitely worth the 6 - Adult or 5- Student \u20ac entry fee. It is definitely a neat experience walking inside all of the caves. Definitely a must-do for a short visit in Luxembourg.",
          "100% worth a visit! Beautiful caverns carved into the valley. Many beautiful view points to check out as as well!",
          "To get the best out of the visit you definitely should take a guided tour. But the problem is that it is not possible to prebook the tour, you just need to come here during the times that can be found on the official website, and hope that you get a place. All the information is",
          "The Casemates require a lot of walking on a not-so-straight surface so be sure to wear very comfortable shoes. Also in some parts they get narrow so I would advise people who are claustrophobic not to visit these sections. Other than that, I think it is a place worth visiting.",
          "Definitely one of the things to do whilst in Luxembourg. It is something you should not give. They give you such an insight on the past history of the country",
          "Another recommendation from the hotel and something I missed on a past trip to Luxembourg. You can spent an hour walking around the caves in the city and wall and can take some very cramped spiral staircases which are nice. The caves have plenty of light since they have open",
          "The history of Luxembourg is here, the statue of a golden lady and the park with Luxembourg flags. Nice and fantastic view. Nice city walk will tell the tourist the history of Luxembourg. Must visit.",
          "It was used as a army base, castle and jail. The cavern oozes history. The views of the GRund, the river, the abbey and the viaduct is also great.",
          "Totally worth the money. Not to crowded with a nice view around the city. You can easily walk around for about 60 minutes.",
          "From here, you get plenty of excellent views of the beautiful city, It is interesting to explore the old fortress and to suck in the atmosphere. A great getaway in the middle of a busy city. A great place to start a day of exploring Luxemburg.",
          "we had a quick visit to Luxembourg city so this was the most famous place in the city which must be seen ,the view was great to walk and see the historic signature but my advice to not ride the tour train it was poring specially if you have children thy get bored and thy don't",
          "We went here only to be told its cash only so had to walk back up a massive hill to find a cash point, they really need to inform you this before you go! But for \u00a36 it was a decent time spend.",
          "This was recommended by our hotel landlady, and quite interesting to find out the history and use of the city walls. There were a couple of areas that were dead ends, not specifically signposted until you got to a closed door, but not insurmountable. Sturdy shoes essential due",
          "My wife and I were walking around the City. We were really looking forward to seeing Casemates du Bock. We were not disappointed. It was amazing. All the different portals that allowed us to see out on both sides were very cool. We absolutely loved it!",
          "We toured this site after reading some of it\u2019s history and quite a history is has. It goes back to 963 and Count Siegfried and the castle Lucilinburhuc (which gave Luxembourg it\u2019s name). Subsequent fortifications were built on this site over the centuries. We paid 16\u20ac (5\u20ac",
          "It's beautiful here, we didn't really understand the history much but lovely to wander around and great views!",
          "This was not high on my list of things to see but I was nearby and had free entry with the Luxembourg Card. It was pretty cool to walk around the tunnels and look outside just as so many people have done for hundreds of years. Lots of steps and uneven walking, as could be",
          "We went early on a Sunday and got there right at opening time (10am). We had the place to ourselves which was wonderful as we could really see everything and admire the views without the crowds. Highly recommend adding this to your tour list of Luxembourg.",
          "A grear part of the city to get an understanding of the history of Luxembourg and to get fantastic views across the city. Takes a while to explore all the caverns and passages and a little more information in the boards would have been helpful but overall, a good place to visit",
          "This is a great place you need to visit in Luxembourg, especially in summer, you can hide here for a little bit from the heat outside. Great city views on the lower City and Alzette river. Price to enter: 7 euros, adult",
          "An underground set of cave to be explored. Great way to experience the past and what occurred in the time when this was actually a defensive position during the wars. Easy to find and entry price was not too much for what you saw.",
          "This is the place that you can see the history of Luxembourg City. It has also very charming view of old city Grund and new city Kirchberg. Do not forgot to go on top of the small tower and take pictures of Red bridge. You can also listen the speech of Robert Schumann (one of",
          "The fort that once stood on the rockes is largely gone as it was demolished long ago, but underneath the rock there are many corridors with openings to the outside, which give the casemates a clear view of large parts of the gorge. If you enjoy a more claustrophobic experience,",
          "A trip into 18th and 19th century underground fortifications. At various points you have views over the town. The main quibble is that the information boards are not in English, so it was a real struggle to pick out the meaning with grade 5 O level French. There are English",
          "Highly recommended to take the guided tour as it gives you plenty of background and history of not only the casemates but Luxembourg city as well!",
          "Unesco certified this place is one of the main attractions of Luxembourg. It really represents what this city is all about and that these fortifications kept Luxembourg pure and free.",
          "This part of Luxembourg is a must.The Bock is built into and carved into the rock cliffs were the past residents lived. It's not a huge area but is still thankfully preserved. The city of Luxembourg has it's own unique layout and has a real quirky kind of charm to it.The Bock",
          "Do take the guided tour as the history if a key feature in this place. Our English guide told the story of this place in a very interesting and clear way.",
          "I did the one hour guided tour in English and the guide was very good. I don't think I would have gotten as much out of it on my own because there aren't a lot of explanations.",
          "We explored the Casemates during our half-day in Luxembourg City. It was nice to see this piece of history. In 1,5 - 2 hours it will give you a good impression.",
          "As a Roman ruin, you must take some time to explore this place if you are going to stay in Luxembourg City. It is a must go and will have some tourists if it is at a peak time.",
          "The paths are surprisingly poorly marked, so you can get lost and end up walking up and down lots of stairs and finding lots of dead ends. Not much is labelled, as you're really mainly just walking through tunnels. If this doesn't sound like your thing, don't bother - but",
          "This is an interesting site, the underground tunnels give a real insight into how the city was defended for so long. The fact that the network of tunnels stretch for 17km around the city means they must be under most of the city. The views out to both sides over the valley",
          "100 % sure to don't skip this attraction. Worth it to walk up and down. Very nice view from up specially when weather is sunny. Very interesting how they built this city :)",
          "There was an entrance fee which was unnecessary as I felt there wasn't much upkeep needed. But worth a look around none the less.",
          "Excellent way to spend a couple of hours and at 6 euros per adult good value. Leaflet available in different languages and useful explaining the history.",
          "Recommended after visiting the tourist information office in the centre. Worth the 10 minute walk from the tourist information and stopped at the palace to take a look on the way",
          "Not easy to find the entrance and maybe overpriced but still worth a visit. It has an interesting history and what is left would have been demolished but for the fact a lot of the city would have been destroyed as well. There are good views from the gun 'ports' and enjoyed",
          "My cousin and I visited Luxembourg City for 1 day and the Casemates du Bock were on our list of what to see. We were not disappointed. We enjoyed this historic site and the views into the old central section of the city were lovely. Be prepared to walk and do some steps when",
          "This is a special attraction because of the historic importance, but is quite disappointing. It was recognized as UNESCO world heritage site.was built first in 1644 and are 23 km long . Actually this is an underground fortress used to defend Luxembourg from the enemies from",
          "It costs 6 euros to enter. You seem to be able to see if from all over but it is difficult to find the entrance. Head for the flags above it and go down the steps inside. It is interesting to look around but also dark and there are many stairs. The staircases are uneven and",
          "THE rock Luxembourg is build on, lots of history which made our day - thanks to our local guide Karin Stephano !!! She knows all about Luxembourg also about the vanlife people from Pataschas world.",
          "This place must visit when you are in Luxembourg , old place with historical events , nice scenery ; you can take a lot of photos over there",
          "Picturesque, this venue is a must visit when in Luxembourg. Take a stroll al around and enjoy the scenery which seems to belong to a fairytale! Equally nice to visit when the sun is down!",
          "Amazing to think of all the people that survived because of these tunnels. take a map before exploring, we didnt!",
          "Worth a visit. The view is amazing. It\u2019s an old castle that was isolated on a rock in the middle of a valley. After the visit head into the lower town for lunch!",
          "From Casemates is nice view. 6\u20ac the tickets,I think not bad,but everywhere stairs and stones, nothing special...",
          "This is a very cool stop in your trip to Lux. You can see the city from some scenic angles. There are lots of little crevices that offer a cool perspective. The ticket is 6 euros and is well worth the price. Just know you will be up and down a lot of stairs during your visit!!!!",
          "It's an old and historical place and you can spend a good time there by walking or doing other activities taking pictures and so many things to do there .",
          "The narrative of the Casemates and how different countries came and fortified Luxembourg is strange but true. There are miles and miles of caves used for hiding armies against invaders, used as a means of invisible transport of cannons and weaponry, and as shelter for the",
          "The views of the city are wonderful from the casemates, and the tour was very informative. Easy to get to from the main part of the old city.",
          "Talk about a walk trough history. Stunning views and interesting sights well worth the 6 euros. Pair with a trip down to the charming Grund district",
          "I accompanied my husband to Luxembourg on Business and at first was unsure of what to do and see here as it is a small city in a small country. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The Casemates du Bock was one of my first stops, and the surrounding area of Grund was simply",
          "The best thing about the Casemates on a scorching hot day is that they\u2019re refreshingly cool inside! That isn\u2019t to say they aren\u2019t worth seeing otherwise, because they absolutely are, although in all honesty, you\u2019d struggle to spend the hour or two here some guides suggest. They",
          "The views of this area are stunning and include the Grund. This is a perfect photo opportunity so get your cameras ready. An old part of history this is a can't miss area.",
          "Whatever else you miss, don\u2019t skip this one, it\u2019s a great fortification and the views of the Grund and of haute Ville are stunning! Take a flashlight though",
          "We really enjoyed wandering this rather odd remnant of Luxembourg's old defenses. There is quite a lot of history displayed around. There are a lot of odd passages and stairways, some leading nowhere, that can get a bit scary, hard to walk up/down, definitely not for mobility",
          "Do take the tour as you will know more of the history of this place The tour guide gave a fascinating history and legends of the city.",
          "This was our first visit of our trip to Luxembourg, & we really enjoyed it. If you are interested in the history of Luxembourg itself, you cannot not do this one! Those who are physically challenged when walking should be advised this could be a struggle. Enquire first.",
          "A great experience, a bit claustrophobic but I think that\u2019s the point of the tour! Not expensive and we can finish in a grass park near the river. Go there and see for yourself s",
          "Amazing ruins of the wall around the city. Not difficult to navigate even for seniors. This is a must see in Lux City!",
          "The views from in side the caves across the city are worth a visit. If you have any problems with your legs a walking stick or a friend to lean on a good idea.",
          "Great place to walk around and visit. Such history and very high above the city. Breath taking views....a must do when in Luxembourg.",
          "Good price, 10 euros for 2 adults and 1 child, we took the guidebook in English and it had a map of the tunnels. Lots of history to the tunnels and we saw a few cannons along the way, great views too. This is a must if coming to the city.",
          "This came up on my app as a castle so I was surprised when I had to go underground to get there. There is a handy leaflet from reception that explains what you can see.",
          "Exploring the Casemates was one of the highlights of our visit to Luxembourg city. We chose to do the self-guided walk (with a very helpful guide issued at the ticket office) and were very glad we did because it meant we could go at our own pace, backtrack, take in the views,",
          "Despite the 10 euro fee, this is really something you have to visit and do when in Luxembourg city, just get lost in the kilometers of tunnels inside the rock and enjoy the views!",
          "This is a must do when in the area. Every level offers incredible views of this beautiful city. Great photography opportunities. We made this a stop on our own walking tour of the city.",
          "It took us a bit to find the entrance since we started in the lower town in Grund. Once we did find the spot on top we entered and immediately joined the 11am tour in English- we really lucked out. Our tour guide did a great job with not just the basics of the history but",
          "This attraction is definitely a must see in Luxembourg. It's a place that feels like you are going back in time, walking around the corridors. It is advisable to wear comfortable shoes.",
          "This very popular tourist attraction was built in the 18th century as part of the city\u2019s defences. There is a maze of tunnels to explore and excellent views of the lower city from the cannon openings. Apart from that, there\u2019s not much to see, only some poorly explained medieval",
          "The casemates are of historical interest, but otherwise not terribly exciting for older folks. Their main attraction must be for kids, many of whom were there, dashing about the corridors and into all the niches. I imagine this web of caves carved out of the cliff feeds the",
          "Though the Casements entrance was a bit challenging to find it was definitely worth the effort. My wife and I spent a couple of hours exploring the interior. It would be a great place for a family to explore- a great way for children to learn about both history and geology.",
          "You can find this place at the end of the chemin de corniche also along the Wenceslas trail. Just look out for the signs and you should find it. You have to take a flight of stairs down from the corniche and you are at the entrance. It costs 6 euros for an adult to enter. The",
          "I have heard many times about the Casemates and the history of Luxembourg. I was finally able to see it for myself. I was certainly impressed. The city is a complex blend of the old and historic and the new and modern. However, it is clear that modern technology has been applied",
          "Walking the corridors of this place makes your mind work overtime as you could not help but to wonder how soldiers could wage battle in such conditions back then. Even though the place only has a few old canons to break up the monotony and the unstable walking condition, it",
          "If you do not have time to visit the history museum, just take a short walk (15 min) from city centre and make a tour of these casemates. A local guide could tell you a lot on the history, but there are also numerous boards displaying information. Nice view both to the city and",
          "It is good to go prepared. Read about and than go. Entry - only cash. We had to find the machine first. For all those with some claustrophobia - there are small corridors, steep stairs with little or no lights. I've seen people going through with little flash lights. I didn't",
          "The Brasserie du Cercle is a great place to dine. We have been there in several occasions and have always left feeling that the food was worth our money. We tried different typical dishes from Luxemburg - all of them delicious- and also dishes the general European cuisine. All",
          "This should be on every visitors list! They give you a pamphlet with English explanations. I felt the pamphlet could have explained a bit more about the history etc but it was better than nothing.",
          "It was a very beautiful walk, with a great view of Luxembourg and the old fortress walls, but I was quite disappointed about the lack of translation on any of the plaques. It\u2019s a shame because I really wanted to learn more about the history of it, but I don\u2019t speak German or",
          "Interesting to see but lacked information beyond the first room. The front desk was unmanned for ten minutes when we arrived. Can use a Lux Card, so that is great.",
          "Hell-O again It's was my first visit in Luxembourg and 1st tourist attractions hahaha... 2 min walk from city center. Very nice view and great place for taking some photos. Of course recommended!",
          "Yes the views are nice but these views can be seen from outside on top of the entrance or on the way down to the Grund. The steps are very small and steep for my size 11 feet. It should be free I do not normally give such negative reviews but I like value for money",
          "We visited here in mid-March. We had a tour guide who was extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the casemates and the history of the surrounding area. It was a nice experience, but if I could redo it, I'd choose to go when it was a bit warmer out, as it was very cold",
          "We visited this place when we had bad weather. It\u2018s a great activity because you\u2018re inside and you don\u2018t get wet. The Casemates are nice to walk around and you can see how they build the old fortress inside the stone. Only 4stars because we also did a privat casemates tour and",
          "I visited the casamates alone. It is good value for money and is definitely worth visiting. There isn\u2019t as much to visit as I thought there would be but nevertheless, it was still good. Be warned though, the steps leading down into some areas are Very steep, small and quite",
          "I really enjoyed this experience but felt often scared when going down the long winded stairs as they were very small and narrow. The experience all in all was amazing and I can see why its considered a Unesco heritage site. I would not recommend it if you are scared of small",
          "one can certainly imagine the grand placement of such a fortified town. walking to see the different sides and views of the walls and castles is fun too. cold in March but a great couple of hours if you make the time",
          "Fun to get lost in Casemates but can definitely skip if you do not have time. Many caves and small lookouts in the path",
          "This is a spectacular historical remnant and part of the absolutely stunning Wenzel walk around the old historic city. The casemates are interesting tunnels carved into the rock/fortifications of the fort, but we thought they were overrated. It would be hard to skip skip the",
          "Tunels and secret passages with more than 3 centuries of history. It is what remains from the old fortification that Luxemburg destroyed to become neutral and Independient. It is amazing and you will also see some structures from WW II when it was used as a shelter.",
          "Great views of the city centre. We paid \u20ac6 to enter and were done within half and hour. Note that there are a number of steep steps here but once you\u2019ve navigated your way around them the sites you see are pretty awesome.",
          "You will walk through the tunnel that was built in order to o protect the city, it is amazing the way this was designed, you must visit this historic place. Vas a caminar por los t\u00faneles hecho para proteger la ciudad, es in legible ver como fueron dise\u00f1ados en su \u00e9poca, debes de",
          "All my children have a significant understanding of history and also enjoy strategy & tactics games. This visit was a great adventure. It took me awhile to conquer my fear of heights but then I enjoyed looking out of the fortifications. What an amazing part of history. It",
          "Visit the Casemates to have an idea of one of the most protected castles in Europe. From the Casemates open spectacular views of the town especially in the evening.",
          "It's incredible in any of the 4 seasons - it's an unique experience, where the past and the present connect. Strongly recommend.",
          "We were lucky to find the Casemates open in February and spent a good couple of hours wandering around the tunnels. We were given a guide printed in English which helped us understand the history of the place. Entry was good value at \u20ac6 each.",
          "Good for tourists, doesn\u2019t take a long time ~1h, and not expensive. Just that I had expected more based on what people had said but it was okay, fairly average!",
          "This place transports you to the old story of Luxembourg, inside it\u2019s kinda scary but you\u2019ll be please to see the beautiful old city through the caves. The point of you is also wonderful. Don\u2019t miss it.",
          "Since I am a native Luxembourger I have been here multiple times. Of course it becomes boring when you visit it too often. However, visiting it every few years is amazing and visiting it for the very first time even more so. You van actually experience a bit of history. Just",
          "Beautiful views from these winding caves. Not stroller friendly or for pets. Floors are a little uneven, but it was carved from rock, so it\u2019s to be expected. Just be mindful of where you step.",
          "Wandering around the casemates you get a fantastic feel of what it must've been like fightes in this fortified stronghold in the middle ages. It's like a fortress inside a mountain... it took centuries to build, but the ruins now offer a fantastic view on the city... and great",
          "We were two visiting the site. It\u2019s a wonderful place to explore. Take the time to look at over and see how that city was protected in medieval times. In the winter it\u2019s cold inside but not too cold to miss. The entry fee is moderate at \u20ac7pp, children have a lower fee.",
          "A very interesting visit to these medieval fortifications. We had a great time exploring the caves and would recommend to anyone visiting Luxembourg.",
          "As a tourist in a very small city this is a good place to visit. It was \u20ac6 entry and we were in there for approx an hour. Opportunity for some great pictures.",
          "Really fun to walk through the caves and get some amazing pictures. Doesn\u2019t take too long but something fun to do for an hour or so!",
          "Interesting to get a better understanding of the defence works and corridors underground. The booklet you receive is self explanatory and the many viewpoints offer nice views of the surrounding areas. Nevertheless, I had expected that one could wander around across a larger area",
          "If visiting Luxembourg is well worth visiting the maze of caves which run underneath parts of the city. Not mind -blowing but interesting and good vale.",
          "I found it really interesting wandering about the tunnels with some fabulous views of the area. Relatively inexpensive. Probably took about an hour to explore. Wear good walking boots as it's very uneven under foot.",
          "Casemates along the Grund is breathtaking and the best thing in Luxembourg in my opinion. I went on beautiful sunny fall afternoon which made it even more outstanding. Take your time and walk along the Grund, explore Casemate an UNESCO site.. have a picnic on the grounds or",
          "I will definitely be back to Luxembourg just to see this park during the spring or fall! It is completely unbelievable to have such an amazing spot just outside of the city centre! Can\u2019t wait to see it in the nice weather during the blossom season!",
          "Nothing special besides the history. Expect alot of walking and closed shops. Just one word for this-Boring.",
          "I loved the place for the amazing photographs we managed to have. The veranda like paths over the city is really lovely. I give it three stars as we weren\u2019t able to see the tunnels as they were closed during our visit and maybe next time we would manage to visit them.",
          "such a beautifull place and most important thing the VIEW of the city. if you want to see the the beauty of the city then this is one the best place to visit",
          "The caves are listed as UNESCO World Heritage and it is one of the nice, unique things to visit in Luxembourg. The historical explanations (not the guided tour) are light touch, easy to digest but enough to put what you see into context. I liked the fact you can get a bit of",
          "While walking from Grund up to town don\u2019t miss to visit the casemates, the caverns under the upper part of the town, that used to give shelter to soldiers and to better defend the forteress. Best in May-September.",
          "The caves are closed during the winter months due to danger of slipping. If you make your way down to the Grund, valley, you can look up to the cave windows.",
          "Discover Luxembourg's subgrounds and learn about out history. Casemates are one of the things to do and see if you come To visit our country. Hope you will enjoy",
          "this is a great place to visit.it shows why the place was so well defended in days gone by.it cost 6 euros to enter.it is like a rabbit warren when you are in there.there are steps going up and down,and many openings in the rock,used as gun points.the views from these openings",

          "The view was gorgeous. It was unfortunately overcast when I was there but I still got some good photos.",
          "Listed at the top of luxembourg attractions, the casemates do not dissapoint. The casemates are shrouded in mystery, and going through you can't help but get a feeling of advancing through a game. Really worth it, if not by the underground galleries, go for the views!",
          "Well. It has a lot of stairs in it. A lot! It's an experience to visit for a cheap price, but it's nothing special. But you can take good pictures and the lights are beautiful.",
          "I did not pay to enter, but walked around at the top and down some stairs. You can look out over the ville base and there are some wonderful things to see. I particularly liked looking out through the barred tunnels.",
          "We didn't have much time to visit Luxembourg but this place looked interesting so we went in. We did not wait for a guided tour but just stumbled our way around ourselves. It's a real warren of tunnels with occasional windows and staircases. Very intriguing and it's a pity that",
          "The Casemates are significant in Luxembourg's history, so I always take visitors for a brief visit. I personally don't spend hours there but enjoy seeing the old ruins on a short visit.",
          "Lovely views around the whole area. A must visit place while in Luxembourg. The climb down was not attempted by us, but there is a lift back to the top",
          "The Bock is a large fortress in the north-eastern corner of old Luxembourg. It is a rocky cliffs tower above a river which surrounds it on three sides. An old castle was built in 963. Ruins of the old castle and the vast underground system of passages and galleries known as the",
          "It's very interesting to walk through the tunnels and wonder what happened here... There was a short leaflet, but these tunnels with such a great past needs more. It would be great if There was something Like an audio tour or more guided tours.",
          "We visited this place on our holiday based on its fantastic trip advisor reviews. It involves a self-guided tour of the tunnels extending under the city and within a beautiful archaic bridge. The place itself is easily accessible and conveniently comes under the cost of the",
          "By visiting casemates we were surprised by the size and the variety of corridors we could walk through. Sometimes it was rather dark and the nobil light was useful. It was difficult in some corridors and staircases (leading to nowhere) to pass the other visitors. from the",
          "it was good to explore the different tunnels. don't worry you can't get lost. the paths are all straight forward either leading to a dead end (so you need to turn back) or to another exit point. Good for rainy day. Just be careful of your steps.",
          "who can guess that this beautiful little town is actually located in the middle of a super busy and trafficy city!",
          "We spend under an hour visiting the Casemates. It was fascinating to see how this system of fortification evolved through many centuries. If I get the chance to go back I think I'll do the visit with a guide as a lot of information was not available.",
          "One of the main tourist attraction in Luxembourg with the Casemates which used to be a self defence site. Wonder around the maze that in 1994 is listed as a UNESCO world heritage site. Just look at the map/leaflet first before visiting. One thing to becareful of it's the uneven",
          "Casemates costs \u20ac6, but it's a fun and interesting few hours if you have them to spare. I enjoyed the time spent here and I would recommend visiting this if you are in the area of Luxembourg.",
          "Amazing work and nicely remained. It's a bit easy to get lost inside, eventually I find my way out. Maybe more indications on the wall would help.",
          "Key part of the history of Luxembourg city, definately recommend visiting the casemates and walk through the old walls of the fortress. Quiet an adventure to walk through the, at times tiny, corridors of the walls, and to imagine in almost complete darkness how history events",
          "This was a must see for me in Luxembourg. The ancient fortress is impressive and dug into the side of a hill. Fantastic to see and some great photo opportunities.",
          "First off let me say that quite unfortunately we were unable to get entry to the actual tunnels and structures of this amazing fortress on our visit to Luxembourg. We did however take many different pictures and get many different views of it from various locations and I have to",
          "The Bock Casemates and the history behind them are all integral to the very existence of Luxembourg City ... so a visit here is a must, especially if you're a history buff! Opening hours are from 10am to 8:30pm, although it's closed during the winter months (do check the",

          "If you have children you know how caves abs castle appeal, on a city break with a 4,7,9 year old and visiting these for a few hours was great. It was not overally expensive. NOTE: cash only! They do tours around but we just wandered, there is a small leaflet that gives some",
          "It was super hot as I got off the plane and my host rolled us to the Casemates du Bock. There it was rather cold. My body didn't know night from day or up from down and here I was in caverns with views of the city. Absolutely crazy. Super cool to get a glimpse of the city and",
          "Our boys enjoyed this. Lots of steps, narrow passageways and little rooms. Good leaflet to explain the different rooms. Only comment would be that the direction could be better signposted! Several times we had to retrace our steps!",
          "We were a little hesitant about entering the tunnels but were very glad we did. It's a fascinating look into the city's history, going back centuries. The tunnel floors are mostly uneven and the spiral staircases steep and narrow, but we found those easy enough to manage as long",
          "27 degrees on a lovely day in Luxembourg and what do I do. I go into a series of caves and tunnels which overlook the old side of Luxembourg. Apart from being a bit unsteady under foot. This trip is a worthwhile visit but not if you are elderly or infirm as the spiral stone",
          "An interesting place to visit to go as we had never seen anywhere like this army base camp before. It was worth a visit but I wouldn't want to be there too long and there were quite a few stairs.",
          "I can only say that it is highly worth the \u20ac5! What an interesting attraction! I shan't spoil it but please do give it a visit!",
          "It is an interesting army base camp where u can imagine that in the past, people were fighting and prisoners were kept there and also canon were there. Pretty eerie with some places having such a small space and there are many stairs going up and down and many dead ends. Very",
          "What's a good thing to do when it's raining heavily? Go indoors or even better underground in very old military defence tunnels. It's an interesting visit and gives surprising views of the city.",
          "We took a guided tour of the Casemates du Golf mid August with a guide. The interesting parts were the historical explenations received. The casemates are impressive as they were carved in the rock and served mainly to help protect the fortress and store explosives for military",
          "We were all excited about this but ended up a little scared as there were no arrows directing you where to go and the stairs were treacherous",
          "Great place to visit there was only one place that I felt a bit claustorphobic. Definately worth a visit.",
          "Feel a bit harsh giving this average but in the grand scheme of cave systems and things to do in Luxembourg there are better. Worth a visit if it is raining maybe or if you are really into history.",
          "A very fun experience to walk through the old gates under the streets of Luxembourg. Be aware that it is NOT a place to visit if you're claustrophobic or tall.",
          "The Casemates du Bock is the best highlight of the military history of Luxembourg. It is reasonably priced too.",
          "This is a very beautiful place right in the hart of the town. The walks through the forest are really nice but make sure that you take sport shoes as the steps are not suitable for high heels.",
          "Well worth visiting if in town for a short break. Our 6 year old son loved it. Great views down into Grund area from the 'balconies' within the cliffs. Worth reading the guide leaflet as you go and don't head down into G Area unless you fancy the climb back up.",
          "Impressing journey through history. Buy a ticket and take a walk through theese tunnels buildt for people and soldiers to take shelter during times of war. Interressting.",
          "But so much fun to explore :-) and a great escape from the heat in the middle of summer. Great views over Luxembourg from various vantage points. This attraction is included in the Luxembourg card if you happen to get one.",
          "Nature in the service of the fortress. The view from the Casemates is excellent and maybe it's the most beautiful part of the tour.",
          "Really interesting part of the old castle walls. Lots of hidden tunnels and plenty of spiral stair cases but well worth a visit. Really good place to let kids explore as there is only one way in and out.",
          "It's so easy to miss a lot of Luxembourg's history so don't! - get on a road train and also visit the military defensive tunnels built into the rocks. All very interesting and does not take long. The bars will still be open.",
          "An amazing tunnel complex. Not for the claustrophobic or those who don't like stairs. Lots of walking into the stone cliffs. Amazing to think it was all built by hand without any machinery. Some passages are large enough for horses.",
          "We followed the wenzel path, which walks through a lot of the old fortifications, including the casemates du bock. It was an excellent afternoon, if a bit tiring. Make sure that you bring plenty of water and are ready for hills and stairs!",
          "When Luxembourg was a fortress city there were apparently 35km of these defensive tunnels dug into the rock beneath the city. Here there is maybe a kilometre to explore. A UNESCO World Heritage Site it's well worth a visit because it is so unusual. The few explanatory panels",
          "There are some tricky stairs but if can manage those the view is definitely worthwhile. It is worth having a guide as well to explain the history",
          "The Bock Casements was an interesting place to visit. You walk through many tunnels and passageways that are part of this fort. You can also see old cannons, and you have several nice vistas of the city. I really enjoyed visiting this attraction.",
          "We visited the casemates on a rainy summer day. It was a very interesting and surprising experience, once you ' d never expect people could have carved those tunnels in the rock. The view of the city from the casemates is stunning and one gets surprised to see the way the place",
          "Discover the underground tunnel network. Wear sensible shioes as stones are awkward to walk on and slippy",
          "The casemates are underground battlements - great protection for the cannons, troops and supplies. The visit is self guided with an explanatory leaflet - unfortunately the rooms are not well signposted and it would be easy to miss seeing sections. Great views of the river and",
          "If you're going to go here, be prepared for a lot of climbing. Be careful when going up or down the stairs as they're slanted. Bring a torch (or phone flashlight) and remember where you've been. It will make leaving easier. It's quite easy to get lost here, there are a lot of",
          "Hi everyone, I visited the Bock in May 2017 and highly recommend it. Apparently a Count Sigfried acquired the Bock from an an Abbey to build his castle. Also archaeologist have recently unearth Roman artifacts. Therefore, there are many layers of history making the Bock a",

          "Fantastic view of the city. \u20ac6 per person. Some tight spaces and stairs. Can be dark in some places so watch your step. Worth the visit.",
          "Amazing tunnels carved into the cliff side but I think six Euros is a little much to pay For the lack of knowledge and literature inside the cassemates. Still worth a visit though",
          "This place has a lot of nooks and crannies to explore. I think kids would have a lot of fun here. We did too!",
          "Very interesting place. Long caves. Lots of very small staircases. Could do with better signs to say which way to go",
          "The casemates are a dramatic settling along the Alzette. Luxembourg avails many stunning vistas and photo opportunities, drawing you further & further to explore.",
          "Very easy to walk from the city centre and cheap to go inside, although me and my friend did'n't as we were running out of time. Deffo on the list if you are visiting!",
          "Good place to get views of the old and modern city. Gardens are well maintained. There are narrow steps to be aware of.",
          "If you like tunnels, mooching about in the dark and climbing stairs then this is the place for you my sister and i had lots of fun scaring each other here.",
          "Firstly be prepared, only cash is accepted at the entrance. We did the self guided tour and you are given an information pamphlet, my problem was that the place is so poorly lit that I could only read it when at places with natural light. There is very little to see or remark",
          "When you like visiting historical places this is a good one. The brochure you receive at the entrance is too limited to get a clear view on the background of the monument and how to visit it. Don't be afraid to walk on turn stairs and unstable, rocky ground. A commented or audio",
          "Great place because it offers something quite different in Luxembourg. A mix of history with a bit of adventure.",
          "If you've explored any sort of underground fortifications or tunnels before, you'll likely fine Casemates du Bock to be a bit underwhelming. It's a small space, with awkward lighting, narrow spiral staircases that lead to dead-ends, and views of construction cranes. It's worth",
          "Luxembourg .. everyone asked me why I was going and once they saw this picture they understood !! Just stunning views stunning country !!",
          "Not going to lie, I got a little claustrophobic and anxious here. But it was also VERY cool to see in person. There are great views of the city, and you can feel the history. It wasn't over crowded with people, and it was a great experience.",
          "Really good to do for a couple of hours, the views are amazing. and it is right in the city centre. Also quite nice to escape the heat!",
          "After listening to podcasts and reading tourism books we knew we didn't want to miss this. It was amazing to think how this sold the test of times. It would've been nice to have a little more information on the TVs.",
          "These are extremely impressive fortifications.Though having read other reviews,and having claustrophobia I don't thing that I would enjoy going inside them.They have left an impression on my mind ever since I first saw then over 20 years ago.",
          "Casemates du Bock is located beneath the former castle, Mont\u00e9e de Clausen. The Bock Casemates is a 17 km long tunnel, initially carved out of the rock by the Spanish between 1737 and 1746. Being a shelter for more than 35,000 locals and thousands of soldiers during the WWI and",
          "Great fun with a four year old. Hit a bunch of dead ends, climbed steep stairs, and found cannons. The stuff of which kid's dreams are made.",
          "A very insightful history of Luxembourg in the casemates of the castle. Never knew it had been fought over so many times and invaded more times than France and Belgium, which is saying something ! Whatever time of year, wear warm clothes as it's a constant 8C. We had a business",
          "I did the guided tour with Lou and it's was one of the best guided tours I ever made. The place it's incredible and be aware with the stairs to not fall down..",
          "This was the most enjoyable activity I did in Luxembourg City. You can explore deep into the casemate. Lots of dark tunnels, with occasional windows that allow you to look out over two different views of the town. It is easy to get lost in the tunnels, but it makes it more fun.",
          "The inside of the Casemates du Bock was surprisingly big with tunnels and spiral staircases winding up and down. If you are claustrophobic some of the spiral staircases are not for you. Great views from the ramparts.",
          "It was nice to walk through the open Bock Casemates. They had some plaques with the history, explaining why the casemates were created, and their varied history (many armies added to the casemates). It was interesting to actually get to walk down and through the casemates.",
          "If you are up for a bit if walking then visit the casemates, they will give you a great view over the city and the cliffwalls as well as a history lesson of the last thousand years and what has happened in Luxembourg to date",
          "A nice place to be in: a little bit cold, but there's not much to do in lux. You can have nice drinks there, yet no food",
          "A beautiful area only a short walk from the city centre. Lots of different perspectives. Historically important.",
          "The place is very nice for visiting but be prepared for a long walk inside. Also small stairs and chambers. The bad part is that is not that many things to see inside and everything ends in a dead end. So, practically, you'll gonna walk the paths twice. I also recommed to use",
          "This is the best attraction in the city in my opinion. You can enjoy a nice walk with some good views of the city. You can explore the tunnels that go throughout as well. It's a nice break from the sun too ;)",
          "The maze of corridors and very narrow passages that takes you into the depths of the fort from the past. The way of construction, complexity and atmosphere are an unforgettable part of this tour. If you are visiting this location with very young children, keep them eye-catching",
          "It is really good to visit it. It will not be the same anymore after you already went in there, but the history is well explained there and you can also walk in. Just be careful of the stairs, as they could be dangerous if you don\u00b4t pay attention at all.",
          "It is impressive that what is left of this structure has datings back to the 900s, who would've ever thought. It's neat to walk through the hallway where cannons and troops marched and imagine the history, but in all, it's a bit boring. I'm glad, for what it is and what I got,",
          "If you go to Luxembourg you have to go to Casemates du Bock. It is the highlight of the city. - Very interesting and fascinating.",
          "A great place in hot weather as you avoid the heat and the sun. We were there about half ten and managed to avoid most of the crowds and tour groups. There are narrow passageways and staircases that could prove difficult at busy times. Great views from the casements, similar to",
          "when you think of Luxembourg city, there is probably not one particular famous landmark that you think of like you would for Paris or Rome. Luxembourg has a lot to offer though, and the 'casemates' are one of those things. The casemates are basically fortifications, but they",
          "We stumbled upon the Bock by accident but the views from it are amazing! It is a world heritage listed site. On one side you can see the Catholic Church with terrace gardens and the river flowing alongside it. On the other side you look over to see lots of picturesque houses and",
          "I was exploring Luxembourg on my own while the other half was working and this was a good way to spend some time out of the sun on a hot day! The history of the place is very interesting and the information leaflet that they give you at the entrance is very helpful. I must",
          "Great historical place, but not much to do after a while. 1h there is more than enough. Wish they would have posters in English . French & German only..",
          "The casemates are 110 m long - 7 m wide and the construction was 1745; the gallery has halls with cannons and loopholes; The Bock Casemates could accommodate some 50 cannons and 1200 soldiers; On your right you can see the last rock of the fortress, called Hollow Tooth; the",
          "As you walk around the upper sections, you get great views of the valleys and the old town as well as some history about the fortress. It's a must-see. Then I discovered that there's an underground section for \u20ac6. This part is pretty short and shows you some of the fortress",
          "Used to be defensive labyrinth and part of them are opened for public. Used as shelter during WWII. Worth to visit.",
          "Visited after 14h, when the temperature was going up in the old town. What a refreshing environment! Nothing too fairy tale though still like in a fairy tale! The views from where the canons were supposed to be, some of them already in place and the explanation leaflet that",
          "I came here with a small group of friends and we spent a couple of hours wandering about and getting lost. It was great. It's historic and good fun for everyone, so long as you don't mind walking",
          "The casemate are nice to see from the outside. The inner side is quite a disappointment as there is nothing much inside except stairs, going up and down,in and out.It like a maze. I do not recommend this place for elderly as it have too many steep and narrow stairs.",
          "Lots of steep and narrow steps ,cool in summers as it was quite hot in May when we were there.interesting to pass through all those caves and tunnels",
          "It is very interesting place with impressive history although we were a bit disappointed since the part you can access is smaller than expected keeping in mind it's initial greatness. Still one should see wile visiting Luxembourg. Prepare for narrow staircases, rough stone floor",
          "i went in forgetting to take the guide/map and was surprised at the amount of paths and tunnels! i got lost several times and hit dead ends...it was fun!! it's like a maze for adults....and kids too. with everything else in luxembourg pretty much boring(bridges, churches,",
          "Amazing architectural job, especially considering that what you see today is just a small proportion of the tunnels that were there historically. Visitors can explore by themselves for as long as they like. I wish there were a bit more information available about the history of",
          "The Bock Casemates are an interesting place to visit - easy to see why they are also called the Gibraltar of the North!' We really enjoyed our visit here, there are great views of the city from multiple spots throughout the amazing tunnel network and caves.",
          "The Casemates du Bock area of Luxembourg City is historically interesting and quaint. The area includes man made caves superimposed by medieval buildings. There are many steep and winding sets of steps to climb to view the features and it is therefore not really suitable for the",
          "Really enjoyed taking a look into the history of the city through this site. The map however needs work as getting around the maze of tunnels isn't easy with a map that makes little sense. Good info and interesting day out. If you're a student then don't forget your card as",
          "This was interesting, but definitely not for those who don't walk well! There are lots of steps, some on spiral staircases. The views are excellent, and as it was a hot day, it was a cooler option!",
          "These caves are unusual but worth a look. We went in the evening and they were lit up and really nice. Built as part of a defence system .",
          "This interesting set of caverns and tunnels is great fun for kids. The views out of multiple windows are fantastic, and the descriptions of rooms and history are informative and short. It's nice and cool on a hot day, and the bathrooms super clean!",
          "There are so many nooks to see as yhou stroll or take the tourist train. Take a little time to leatn some of the history.",
          "Interesting history of war and peace for the last 150 years. My mother is no longer fully mobile, so we asked where there are a lot of stairs and avoided those parts.",
          "The casemates is the foundation of Luxembourg, dated back to the 900s. We joined a tour offered at the ticket office at the casemates, and it is highly recommended! Our tour guide, Robert, is extremely knowledgeable. He tells you the history, culture, and less-known story of",
          "A lot of walking thru narrow tunnels (one person at a time in places), stairs and cannon placements. we enjoyed the walk but know some may have an issue with seeing the full set of tunnels. Even the shorter route without going to the very end is worth the trip.",
          "It's a very centuries old command bunker which was ripped apart by artillery fire. Nice point of view from there on the town but the bunker by itself is just a naked bunker",
          "Part of UNESCO world heritage, the casemates were originally built in 1644 by Spanish domination. Originally there was 23 kilometres of tunnels, or defence passages as they were called. Now there is only 17 kilometres, but the public only has access to a small amount. There are",
          "This is a series of forts and underground tunnels used by armies to defend the city. Certainly the history is interesting and exploring the nooks and crannies in the tunnels can take a while. There are some great views over the old town from various points providing great photo",
          "It was a great place to visit. You can pretty much just wander through the caves, but be aware that the stairs inside are VERY steep.",
          "I bought the guided tour in English with my admission and won the lottery to get Robert as my guide! He is outstanding! He explained the history of Luxembourg and its strategic importance in Europe, as well as detailed the succession of foreign powers that built the",

          "Fascinating onsite to the military history of the city. Costs \u20ac6 . Quite a lot of stairs but through most of the tunnels I could walk upright at 1.8 metres.",
          "What an amazing piece of history and to be able to explore at your own pace made it even better. We spent hours inside going through all the passageways and even paid a small fee to see the rest. Definitely worth a visit while in Luxembourg.",
          "This place is so exquisite, haven't seen any thing like this before. A huge cave network used in the old days to protect the city from raids and invaders. This cave network covers a great area around Luxembourg city center, and had people, food and weapons stored inside. I truly",
          "The gorge running through the city is amazing in itslf but here you can go inside the rock that has been hollowed out for defence purposes. Lots of very claustrophobic steps that lead to empty rooms but it is interesting to see and experience it",
          "\u20ac6 entry fee. You can wander around the tunnels of the city walls. Fun with some lovely views. The info is not available in English, which is a bit disappointing.",
          "Beutifull experience, loads of underground walk paths.. Definitely recommended when visiting Luxembourg.",
          "Grab a map and register the free internet provided by the city, and you would be able to walk from the train station to this place. I spent like 3 hours there as I found it very unique. Nice experience.",
          "Many years ago long before the range of calendar dates suitable for indicting the time of my visit were made available for completing this review I arrived in Luxembourg city. It turned out to be a blessing. I explored the city on foot and I was curious to visit the older",
          "Really enjoyed this visit Extraordinary Well lit Great views A must do I Luxemburg Accessible and easy to find",
          "I did not know much about this when I came upon it during my stroll through the City my first day in from the US. What a pleasant surprise. In parts it feels like caves I've been in Virginia but unlike that, less humidity, fascinating medieval history, winding stairwells leading",
          "The scale of this is impressive of itself. The views, though, are better without going in. It's worth the small entry fee.",
          "I really enjoyed visiting here, there are great views of the city from multiple spots throughout the amazing tunnel network. Inside the temperature is cool and when I visited at 10 (opening time) there was hardly anyone around. Make sure you wear good shoes, there are lots of",
          "If you are into history and love to walk this is the place for you. Even if not into history it's a really cool place to visit. This fort surrounds Luxembourg City and you can walk around it for miles while overlooking the rivers, homes and restaurants below. For a fee you",
          "The Bock Casemates are interesting to visit - but have a plan! There's a lot of ground to cover - literally!! So make a plan so you don't waste your energy going in circles, especially if you plan to combine with the Wenzel Walk (which we did and it made for a pretty strenuous",
          "Toured here while in town for the day. The history of the Casemates was interesting for all of the different nations that contributed to its construction. Worthwhile trip if you are in town.",
          "My review is going to be biased a lot, sorry. In the old days I spent hundreds of hours playing Dungeon Master, Ishar, EOB and others. When going thru various curved corridors with crossroads and staircases carved into stone, it hit me this is a real life experience of those",
          "We only had a view from above, but it was an interesting site. With more time, we will definitely visit again inthe future.",
          "Bock Casemates was more colourful and fun than expected. Also a lot more exercise and staircases than anticipated. The place was like a fun and fascinating labyrinth inside the rock and we really enjoyed the walk and the view. Highly recommended.",
          "It was nice to see a different side to Luxembourg. There are great views, interesting buildings & lovely gardens. There are quite a lot of steps, so comfy shoes are ideal. Most of the signs along the way did not have English on them, which was a pity.",
          "Probably the number one attraction, but you definitely should visit it. If you're also planning to visit a museum you're better off buying a Luxembourg Card as it is much cheaper, available from the Tourist Office.",
          "Allow a couple of hours to be able to get lost inside and read the information on the leaflet (it's better if you follow the letters on the map). Wear comfy clothes and shoes, there are a lot of spiral stairs which are very narrow and the steps are worn. It's a bit chilli inside",
          "Every point in luxemburg are in walking range. Nice place to see all city and understand the history of luxemburg.",
          "Located on the east side of Luxembourg city and is closed to other major attractions such as the Barrio, St. Jean Church & the National Museum",
          "I visited Luxembourg end of March 2017 and chose the weekend when it felt like Spring had really sprung! Visiting The Casements cooled me off after the 25 minute walk from my hotel and the start of the Wenzel Circular Tour. I had printed an online map from Luxembourg City",
          "This ancient fortification provides an insight into medieval life. The fortifications were carved into the rock over hundreds of years, some large enough for horses and some small enough to make you claustrophobic. It was amazing to consider all this work was done with",
          "A lot of people have reviewed this as if it were an 'experience' or a 'ride' rather than for what it is. To appreciate this place, you must have an interest in learning, and be prepared to read the pamphlet they give you and spend time absorbing the atmosphere of the casemates",
          "I like history and old buildings e.g. fortress, castles and I had to visit Casemates du Bock. This fortress is very interesting and you can see picture-perfect views on Luxembourg. You can feel how soldiers had to live in thsi place and had to protect Luxembourg agains the enemy.",
          "I was her on a rainy day. And found it amazing despite the weather. What is left after they knocked most of it down in the 1860's is still amazing. There are some walls and some towers and some bridges. The whole thing is really great.",
          "The tour was cheap which is always a bonus. Not clearly signposted where to actually enter (as there are a view viewpoints above road level that you can view for free), and once inside it's not absolutely clear which route to take, even using the self-guided map. That aside,",
          "One of the best ways to experience the medieval fortress of Luxembourg city. It's an absolute must-go on your trip to Luxembourg! Plunge into history and make great photos of the old town.",
          "We walked through this area. It wa very interesting with beautiful views of deferent parts of the city.",
          "The self-guided tour was pretty interesting, but I'd suggest a paid tour for anyone looking to learn much about the history of the Bach Casements. On the self-guided tour you are able to discover a good amount of the Casements and will find some great views of the old town. I",
          "Amazing crypt that is really affordable and well worth the visit! This takes you through caves near the old town center of Luxembourg!",
          "Our guide Theo Krausch was awesome, he was very enthusiastic about the history of Luxembourg and Casemates. Thanks to him we learned loads of interesting information about war tactics and siege. It is a pleasure to have a chance to listen to someone who is so passionate.",
          "Even though the ticket it's only 6\u20ac there is not much to see inside. It is a good place to visit in a rainy day",
          "It was 6Euro entrance fee. The pictures from the top of the Casemates were better the pictures we captured inside. There was LOTS of stairs (wear shoes with a good grip) and it felt a bit claustrophobic at times, but it is one of those attractions you don't want to miss if you",
          "Although a very beautiful city, Luxembourg City is easily seen in less than a day. That's why it's important to fill up your time with with good visits and acrivities. Bock Casemares is the best option in town, in my opinion. It's a fun ride, with narrow tunnels and an Indiana",
          "The Bock Casements was one of the main reasons I decided to visit Luxembourg. The tunnels carved out of the solid rock was an amazing feat and it was cool to see the cannons placed throughout. The views from the Casements was probably the highlight. Overall, I did not learn too",
          "It is nice to see the views from there, and I imagine if you are really into history. But to be honest, you can actually see the views from the wall without paying any ticket, and not much to see inside, just long caves that used to be used for military purposes. I would not",
          "This sight spot is fairly boring. We went as a group for a day activity. For 6\u20ac it is corridors under the ground, but not really as it is located inbetween two parts of Luxembourg. It is interesting as a dark maze and you do come to an obstacle (maybe by accident) and this is",
          "Good fun exploring the caves with the kids. If you are claustrophobic then you may not want to venture too deep.",
          "We found this to be very interesting and will likely visit again. On rainy days this is an excellent option for guest visiting Luxembourg of if you yourself are a tourist.",
          "Luxembourg or Gibraltar of the North, the never military defeated fortress, the casemattes are part of it, hand digged in rock, with fantastic views on both Sides of the Rock where the castle was build on top. Open now till end of october",
          "Really picturesque! It's quite steep to get up and down but there is actually a lift at the end closer to the city. Great place to take photos and just enjoy the view.",
          "This was a highpoint of our trip. The battlements and its extended tunnels are really worth seeing. Amazing to imagine the history and all the work put into its construction. From the canon ports there are spectacular views of the old city and the rivers. Not recommended for",
          "Good view of valley and bridges near by. Good spot for taking pictures and selfies. It is closed in winter. So I could visit but still worth to pass by for good view of city.",
          "An amazing fortification, built in 963, that was part of a much larger complex. The case-mates were used during times of war to house thousands of soldiers and their horses. What I found most fascinating was how large the case-mates are which enabled blacksmith shops,",
          "Stop by the visitors center and book a walking trip. You will get to see and visit the entire city and also see the casemates.",
          "Because it was winter, this site was closed, but hearing the history and seeing it from outside was good enough. Michaela our guide was so well informed!",
          "The walls of this fortified town are an absolute must see. From Casements du Bock you get a great view of Grund, the old part of town.",
          "Seeing all the cave openings in the cliffs, we were curious to go inside and take a look. It was fun exploring and the views from the openings were lovely. It is hard to imagine a large number of people camped out in those caves. And it was interesting to find out that they were",
          "Lovely to wander along and take in the engineering feat of this structure. Great views from up here. A real historic treat.",
          "view is really good .makes you calm and relax! little city ( country ) has its own beauty ! even people comes from france to work there ! only thing didn't like it lots of strange woman walking around train gar !!!",
          "I was here during December 2016. The views are amazing and it's a pretty nice walk. Pro tip: Le Chemin de la Corniche, Barrio Grund, Casemates du Bock, Viaduc you can do it in all one afternoon, they are located close to each other.",
          "Nice work of engineering, worth a walk around to see the caves and the views. If you have time it is nice to go all the way down to the river and then up again.",
          "The \u201cBock\u201d is a large rocky promontory jutting out over the River Alzette. \u201cCasemates\u201d are rooms carved into the walls of a fortress.

          "Its one of the attractions in luxembourg. Again a place of historical importance Unless you wanna visit the trail or the castles worth spending your time here",
          "Unbelievable what mankind has build in time. Unbeatable strategic area. This was the heart of a great fortress",
          "Unfortunately, it was closed but the view on top is amazing. Tips: 1.many tours , places are close whole winter please check and book them before you go there. But for me it was not a big problem as I only want to spent a lazy holiday with my family in Luxembourg. 2.around",

          "Unfortunately the Casemates du Bock are closed for a good portion of the Fall and Winter. Still it was fun to walk around and on top of them while on a Fall trip to Luxembourg City. Historic and mysterious. They photograph beautifully. It gives you a good idea of why Luxembourg",
          "Very good views of the Grund from the open to the public walk along the top of the fortified walls of the city. However, for a UNESCO site, I don\u2019t know why they would get that status when it is shut for 4 months from November to March. And what signage that there is on the old",
          "if you would like to see Luxembourg, and there are many reasons to do so then the Casemates is one of the great vantage points of the city with spectacular views of the valley named the Grund through which flows the River Alzette, the old part of town which is both quaint and",

          "Self-guided walking tour. A bit confusing (the \"map\" and signage could use some updates in the English version) but well worth it. Stunning views of the city.",
          "Visiting the Casemates is definitely a part of the City, but what you see from the outside is all there is. Some tunnels are available and you can walk up and down some narrow steps but the history and museum could do more to present a greater picture. Perhaps memorable for",

          "Suffice to say, that Casemates du Bock and P\u00e9trusse Casemates are inscribed in the list of world heritage sites by UNESCO. Therefore it is a must to see. For some it can get boring (lots of passages, loopholes, staircases and some narrow areas) but it is definitely",
          "If you don't know what to do in luxembourg, this is a must do. Take confortable shoes cause you will need them.",
          "A very interesting part of Luxembourg cities history. Could perhaps do with a bit more signposting and explanation of the different parts and be warned there are lots of narrow steps to negotiate if you want to see it all. Quite cheap though at 4 euros per adult",
          "This was an interesting place to visit. The tunnels are numerous, but following the plan on the leaflet you can visit them in order. The views from the casemates are good in all dierctions. Some of the tunnels are less well lit than others, but that didn't spoil our enjoyment.",
          "The enterance fee is 4 euro's. The vieuws are great but inside there is no indicated route to follow, so when you take the narrow stairs, halfway there are people going the opposite direction and there is no place to pass. Worth a visit because of the historical importance",
          "You must visit this attraction..my biggest recomendation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the admission fee is only 4 euro for adults..worth every cent",
          "The casemates du Bock are interesting to experience, have great views of Luxembourg city, and present the history of the site. Seemingly like most things in Luxembourg, the thing that would have been the most beautiful (the fort which sat upon these casemates) has been",
          "This is a must see when you you are in Luxembourg, the history is incredible. Make sure that you include going inside the fortress to see exactly how this city was defended.",
          "This is a spectacular place and as a major factor for the development of the city, an absolute must for every visitor to Luxembourg. Take care, it may be cool and moist, especially when you are visiting in fall or winter.",
          "The train through the Grund is a good way to start your exploration of Luxembourg's Grund, with a tale of Siggy and Josefina. The casemates themselves are pretty basic but it's a nice walk. Probably one of the best things to see in Lux.",
          "It's quite an adventurous thing to go inside and watch out for the letter signs to give you directions. I am sure you will get lost on the way once or twice but the entire experience is really worth it.",
          "It was a very interesting place, but we couldn't stay in there too long as in some parts it felt a little claustrophobic. Lots of tunnels, but had great views. It was difficult to find and we seemed to go around everywhere to find the entrance. Very reasonably priced.",
          "We started our free, self-guided walking tour around the walls here. The casemates are a series of tunnels in the walls of the city which used to house defensive cannons. They remain pretty much intact with considerate lighting and provide unique views across the city. The",

          "This place is so amazing and very interesting to visit and explore.. The tunnel construction is so nice and show you the way of Military secrets.. The walkways is very nice and really will make you to explore the ways to defend the old city.. Many rooms and sides to view the",
          "I visited in August 2016 with my friend. We got there a bit before opening time and the man who ran the ticket office brought us brochures to read and pointed us to some pretty views while we waited. He was so sweet. We purchased our tickets and started exploring. It sort of",
          "The casements are very impressive given it is a 21 kilometre network of underground passages with many cannon positions. They cover some 40,000 square metres and once housed thousands of troops, horses, equipment and kitchens. Simply amazing historical site.",
          "Superb experience to be in there!! The history attached to it is amazing. It's a completely different world out there!!",
          "Saw this place only from the outside due to lack of time.It looked very imprsessive from the out side.This building is full of history. Visit it if you can find the time.",
          "This is a must do for the able bodied. You may get a little lost or disoriented, but it's part of the intrigue. The chambers are lettered so you will find your way out. It was fun to explore and imagine what it would have been like to be a soldier in defense of the city so long",

          "I loved this place! A series of caves, tunnels and chambers cut into the cliff face and used by soldiers during the many bloody conflicts the city has endured. You are given a guide and pretty much left to your own devices which is great. I enjoyed the wandering around aspect",

          "There are nice displays explaining the historic significance and role in shaping the country and its identity. There are nice city views, but exploring the interior is mostly looking at dark, old walls and going down stairs into dark holes. It was worth a few euros mostly for",
          "I must have walked by this attraction hundreds of times over the past years. And the look from the outside looks so familiar. Yet, I was still surprised by what is hidden inside the rock. A vast network of tunnels, lots of great viewpoints, ... . Moreover: this is Luxembourg: so",

          "You could probably take a few good looking pics of the landscape being there. Apart from that- you will find yourself in a weird labyrinth where every room looks identical (there's NOTHING) and I realized we followed the plan, which told us to take two curled, long stairs",

          "This is a visit worth making. You can spend as long as you want admiring the casemates. Lots of steps to climb up and down. As solo traveller a bit risky if you fell or sprained an ankle as no else seemed to be around me. No English commentary available. Only the pamphlet given",

          "This is an interesting aspect of the history of the city. Well conserved and easy to reach. Only a pity that the route through the casemates is a dead end, so you have to do most of it twice to reach the exit again.",

          "We were lucky enough to chance on a guided tour in English on the evening of our visit at a cost of 10 Euros each (normal entrance fee is 4 Euros for an adult). The guide spoke excellent English and the hour long tour gave us a good view of this attraction, and we learned a lot",
          "Fascinating site. The views over the gorge is fantastic. Cathedrals and restaurants close by, as well. Enjoy Luxembourg.",
          "Great place to explore. Only costs 3-4 euros and is great fun. Lots of steps and crypts and easy to get lost for a bit. Some bits are a little claustrophobic and there are quite a lot of steps but you can avoid these bits and still see a fair bit. Worth a look",
          "I had been to the Casemates in 2011 when pregnant with my daughter so returning with her in tow was great! 8euro for 2 adults (4 year old free) is a bargain for such a great site that also provides a pretty detailed map in multiple languages and has clean washroom facilities.",

          "Like traveling back in time while wandering inside the tunnels. Pictures don't do justice; you really need to experience in person. On a side note, particularly if you go in the summer, this is an extremely comfortable diversion temperature-wise from outside activities.",

          "While I will not recommend going to Luxembourg to visit these, it is one of the nicest place to visit if you are planning to be there. You can plan a visit for about half an hour. It is very close to the restaurants. Lots of photo ops with nice views of Luxembourg. If you have",
          "You need to pay 4 Euro to enter this and i feel its a waste of money. Its nice to walk in the labyrinth but theirs nothing else to see apart from some cannons. If you like caves and labyrinth then you can visit otherwise we can avoid it.",
          "We never even thought of going here and happened upon it by chance. The entrance fee is low and don't forget the student discount. Once instead follow the alphabet directions and you'll go through amazing parts of the underground area. Some steps are very narrow and go down",

          "We took the tour through the casemates. The guide was great, and give us a lot of extra information! Please note : although the prices are in four (4) languages, the further information boards ar not!! Luckily we were able to catch on to a tour.",
          "Not expensive at all, an interesting little trip to do, the caves offer stunning veiws , however if you suffer from claustrophobia, i wouldnt recomend doing the entire walk as some areas are small and narrow, you can still enjoy the beautiful veiws though :)",

          "Very impressive building. Have a nice walk all around, also by night. They have beautiful lights and it's very romantic to sit at a caf\u00e9 down the river and have a nice view",
          "It was a lot of fun trolling through the tunnels and peeking out over the valley, but the Casemates are a bit of a maze (intentionally so, I imagine) and the maps and signage weren't the most user friendly. It is probably worthwhile bringing a torch for parts of it (your phone",
          "This is the major attraction to see in luxembourg. Was here during winter and now during summer. I can say both has each charm but of course I prefer summer cuz its more pleasant to enjoy the view without being freezing :D",
          "We went there with 2 kids, 4 and 9. While they had fun exploring, it can be a bit scary when you go down the stairs on and on and find some very dark areas. You receive a map with the tickets (cheap, 4 Euros or 2 for kids) but I imagine that if this attraction were in the US you",
          "Our kids loved it and we also found it quite interesting. Offers great views of the city and surroundings.",
          "Just returned from being sent to see these tunnels by the tourist office. We were given a 'sort of' map when purchasing our entry tickets - 4 euros per adult. The floors are very uneven, the lighting very bad and as for signage non existent. The redeeming factors were the views",
          "Hard to believe how they could actually build all this. Super interesting to walk through and it offers awesome places with great views to take Pictures.",
          "Unfortunately I didnt get in the place but outside of it it's amazing. Really breathing taking. If you have time and money just go. It's cool",
          "This is a must-see if you are not scared of the dark; not claustrophobic and definitely not elderly/unfit!! The warnings beforehand from the very thoughtful ticket seller were enough to put me off as though I think I might have managed to get down there, I probably wouldn\u2019t",
          "We visited these tunnels hewn from the rock on a very hot 32 deg. afternoon, and spent an hour in the cool, exploring the labyrinth. The lighting is dim,but this adds to the atmosphere. Great views over city from balconies. Only criticism, the signage to find the entrance is",
          "Despite being interesting, this is a maze of tunnels with NO staff to assist or even signs to orient you in case you get lost. If you have problems with closed spaces I would strongly recommend you to avoid this place or at least never getting away from the main path. In some",
          "In Luxembourg this place is fairly central and there is a great number of views from here. It is definitely worth walking around as there are so many sights. There are bars and restaurants not too far away so if you get tited or bored you can put your feet up somewhere near by"

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Notre-Dame Cathedral (Luxembourgish: Kathedral Notre-Dame, French: Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame, German: Kathedrale unserer lieben Frau) is the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg. It was originally a Jesuit church, and its cornerstone was laid in 1613. It is the only cathedral in Luxembourg.\nThe church is a noteworthy example of late gothic architecture; however, it also has many Renaissance elements and adornments. At the end of the 18th century, the church received the miraculous image of the Maria Consolatrix Afflictorum, the patron saint of both the city and the nation. \nAround 50 years later, the church was consecrated as the Church of Our Lady and in 1870, it was elevated by Pope Pius IX to the Cathedral of Notre-Dame.\nAt the cemetery of the cathedral is the National Monument to the Resistance and to the Deportation. The centerpiece of the monument is the famous bronze monument by the 20th century Luxembourgish sculptor Lucien Wercollier called The Political Prisoner.\nThe cathedral was expanded and enlarged from 1935 to 1938.\n\n\n== History ==\nJesuits from Belgium, which like Luxembourg belonged to the Spanish Netherlands at the time, opened a college in Luxembourg city in 1603, where the majority of young Luxembourgers were taught until 1773. The first stone of the church was laid on 7 May 1613, under Father Fran\u00e7ois Aldenard. The constructor of the building was Ulrich Job, from Lucerne. Under him, the decoration of the columns also took place. The Jesuit church was consecrated and dedicated to the Immaculate Conception on 17 October 1621 by auxiliary bishop Georg von Helfenstein.\nArtistically, it was above all the German sculptor Daniel Muller (died 1623) from Freiberg (Saxony) who contributed to the appearance of the church, his work including the organ tribune. The decorations in alabaster, a favourite material of Dutch Renaissance sculptors, represent early Baroque angels, who play music between leaves and floral decorations.\nAfter the Jesuits had left the city in 1773, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria gifted the church to the City of Luxembourg in 1778, and it became the new parish church under the name \"Saint Nicolas et Sainte Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\". This was convenient, as at the time the old parish church, the church of St. Nicholas on the Krautmaart was small and decrepit, and was demolished in 1779. For this reason, a statue of St. Nicholas stands over the cathedral entrance in Rue Notre-Dame.\nIt received the name \"Notre-Dame\" on 31 March 1848 under the apostolic vicar Jean-Th\u00e9odore Laurent. His successor, Nicolas Adames, had the Baroque interior refurbished from 1854 in a neo-Gothic style. When Luxembourg was elevated to a bishopric by Pope Pius IX on 27 June 1870, the Notre-Dame Church became Notre-Dame Cathedral.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThough a noteworthy example of late gothic architecture, the cathedral has many Renaissance elements and adornments.\n\n\n=== 20th century enlargement ===\nFrom 1935 to 1938 the cathedral was enlarged and expanded. This enlargement, which influence the silhouette of the fortress city of Luxembourg, went ahead according to plans by and under the supervision of the Luxembourgish architect Hubert Schumacher. The expanded area, which connects to the two choir bays of 1613\u20131621, characterises the image of the former Jesuit church both due to its spaciousness and through the architectural unity. The rebuilding of the exterior architecture on the Gothic-style cathedral presented a challenge, since the goal was to harmoniously integrate the church with the surrounding buildings, such as the former Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e building from the 17th century, the national library, the old church of St. Maximin (1751) (now the Foreign Ministry), as well as the old residential houses.\n\n\n=== Towers ===\nThe cathedral has three towers: the west tower, which was the tower of the Jesuit church and which contains the bells, the east tower, and the central tower, which stands over the transept.\nWhen the cathedral was enlarged in 1935\u20131938, the east and central towers were added. The central tower, which is only a third of the height of the other towers, consists of a wide, pyramid-shaped base and a narrow peak covered with copper. The roof itself is carried by a steel frame, consisting of two PN20 beams from ARBED-Belval.\nOn Good Friday, 5 April 1985, around mid-day, work on the roof caused the west tower to catch fire. The church bells, i.e. the Virgin Mary bell, the Willibrord bell, the Peter bell, and the Cunigunde bell, were destroyed in the fire. When the tower collapsed, the roof of the central aisle was also partly damaged. It took until 17 October 1985 for the tower to be repaired.\n\n\n== Burials in the crypt ==\nThe crypt of the cathedral contains the remains of Grand Dukes and Grand Duchesses of Luxembourg. The following people are interred here:\n\nMarie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde I, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg (1894\u20131924)\nMarie Anne, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, born Infanta of Portugal (1861\u20131942) \u2013 Consort of William IV\nFelix, Prince Consort of Luxembourg, born Prince of Bourbon-Parma (1893\u20131970) \u2013 Consort of Charlotte I\nPrince Charles (1927\u20131977)\nCharlotte I, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg (1896\u20131985)\nJos\u00e9phine Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, born Princess of Belgium (1927\u20132005) \u2013 Consort of Jean I\nJean I, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (1921-2019)\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoman Catholic Marian churches\nList of Archbishops of Luxembourg\n\n\n== References ==\nThe information in this article is based on a translation of its German equivalent.",

          "The outside of the church is very nice, but inside, apart from the structure and the very gorgeous stained glass windows, doesn\u2019t offer much. The cathedral in Trier is much more elaborate and the stonework and statues are amazing. If you like churches it\u2019s definitely worth a",

          "Okay, it's not the Notre Dame of Paris, but it is a beautiful building. It was originally a Jesuit church, the foundation stone of which was laid in 1613. It is a remarkable example of late Gothic style, revealing various components & ornaments inspired by Renaissance style.",
          "The cathedral is localized in the central part of the city of Luxembourg and is definitely worth to spend a few mins to step in. Maybe the cathedral doesn\u2019t look as spectacular as Norte dame in Paris or Marian church in Cracow, as it\u2019s much smaller etc. however the walls inside",

          "Perhaps the cathedral was heavily damaged during WWII, but I unfortunately would have to admit that I was rather disappointed, the cathedral was very plain and didn't feel quite coherent. The location is somewhat sad too, being tucked away between bigger more modern buildings.",
          "Do not expect too much ; one of these secondary belonging formely to a Benedictine cloister has become the cathedral of Luxembourg and a few people had in middle ages the idea to initiate a Maria worshipping and many Luxembourgers pilgrates there around Easter times. In these",

          "Not the most impressive cathedral in Europe, but a must stop in in your trip, gothic, nice stained glass, and access to the crypt free of charge. Fully functioning worship temple, consideration is advised if only sight seeing. I have seen larger churches and smaller cathedrals,",
          "Beautiful old church , amazing history and stained glass windows. You can feel time slipping away just opening the doors and walking inside to it's majesty .",
          "lovely cathedral, polite and knowledgeable staff on hand, free attraction that only takes a short time to see. right by most of the other attractions, so you do not have to go out of your way",
          "Great building even for non christians - beautiful windows and an amazing church overall - worth a visit",
          "We popped in for a quick look, free to enter which is nice as so many these days are not. Lovley stained glass window over the alter, and a nice cooling break from the hot sun",
          "The cathedral has the most lovely windows and some impressive ceiling paintings. There are two periods reflected in the interior. Its worth a visit.",
          "Very interesting place with history. Superb windows and well maintained. Some work ongoing actually inside.",
          "If you come to visit Luxembourg this cathedral is absolutely with coming to visit. It's located in the city center, so after that there are lots of other places to walk around and see.",
          "Very beautiful this place. Nice view. Good for a rainy or dry day. Good for a trip with little children.",
          "Interesting place, lots of history, unfortunately we couldn't go on a guided tour ad it was fully booked \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Compared to the churches in Italy, this one is sober. Little woodwork, little statues, very nice and colorfull windows.",
          "It's nice to visit this cathedral when you are in luxembourg. Not a very special place. You can burn some candles and it's free of charge. You can donate some money for them.",
          "The Cathedral is right in the hart of the town. You could visit free of charge- make sure that you take appropriate decent clothing. Voluntaries are present in the cathedral and are happy to offer information about the place or concerts and other events in the cathedral.",
          "In short Luxembourg is a treat to visit. Friendly people, lovely restaurants and a variety of places to see. This is a place for a short term trip if you want a view and break type experience.",
          "A lovely peaceful retreat in the heart of the city. The architecture is stunning with beautiful stained glass windows. There are people begging outside the doors - they look intimidating but are no bother to tourists.",
          "Absolutely amazing. The pictures and stained glass windows are incredible. Well worth a visit. Words cannot describe this Cathedral.",
          "As a monarchist and history buff, the Cathedral Notre Dame was without a doubt on my list of places to visit. Being in the centre of the city, it is very easy to reach. It is also something of a guiding point, with its large, dark spires dominating the city's skyline. As a place",
          "Looks fairly uninspiring from the outside buthere is some interesting history just inside the door, some beautiful stained glass windows and if you can negotiate the stairs, it is worth going down into the crypt as there are some interesting fatures down there",
          "The stained glass windows alone are worth seeing. Very impressive. The downstairs chapel is lovely and also houses the royal crypt.",
          "The Notre Dame of Luxemburg cathedral is a hidden gem in the old town. The tapestries and paintings as well as the stained glass windows in the oldest portion of the church are really beautiful.",
          "I've been to many cathedrals in Europe but this one was the most peaceful. Quiet, and tranquil if you go early. We were there in the morning and it was nearly empty with just a few locals praying in the chairs. Beautiful architcture, we'll kept and cleaned. All around incredible!",
          "The charming huge window panes tell a story in themselves and every step within this building is so peaceful, the architectural beauty would change you and it's grandeur will certainly leave a long lasting mark in your memory.",
          "I have to be honest, I've seen more beautiful churches. However, visiting this kind of places (mosque, churches, temple) bring a sense of peace. It just feels different. So yes, I would still recommend this place.",
          "Beautiful church, the workmanship is unreal. Stop and light a candle. Would Recommend seeing it.the location is great right in the city center",
          "The baroque-inspired Notre Dame cathedral has a magnificent main altar with a gilded statue of Mother Mary and is called \"Crown of the old town\"",
          "A beautiful Cathedral in a beautiful city !! Special treat of a heart shaped piece hanging from the ceiling ! Ever time it moved the light shined thru !!",
          "I was looking forward to this and it did not disappoint.Very Beautiful I have visited Notre Dame in Paris so it was good to compare",
          "An understated interior but saying that beautiful stain glass work. Free to enter. Stonework of entry is very intricate.",
          "Amazing place to see in Luxembourg. Don't pass there without going inside! Is very nice inside and the coloured glass is gorgeous.",
          "The designs in the stain glass windows are great. The rest of the interior feels like a bit of a let down. No access to the tower like some churches have.",
          "Well, it is one more cathedral in Europe... :) It is not like the Notre Dame in paris (which I liked the most) but still worth a visit.",
          "The stained glass is lovely. Try and avoid the tour groups if you can, you will have a far more pleasant visit if you do with more time and space to take in the feeling of the cathedral.",
          "Relatively small by some cathedral standards but beautiful inside. Lovely stained glass. Worth a visit inside if you are passing by.",
          "This is a great church in Old Town. The stained glass is beautiful and there is an area where you can light candles. Definitely recommended if you are in the area as a place to visit, reflect, and take some nice photos.",
          "It's large but not particularly so. The stained glass is good but not outstanding, although the knights at the back are done well. The columns are the most interesting as they have patterns cut into them. It seems to be popular with tour groups. But it's a nice church, a",
          "Notre Dame du Luxembourg is a large cathedral with plaques about the history of the cathedral and the area. If you're walking around the city centre, make sure to drop by here",
          "Likes to visit churches with stained glass works and what a beautiful and calm place.dont compare with the one in Paris just feel the peace",
          "Worth a visit. The stained glass windows let in beautiful light ( not dark like some cathedrals) and the atmosphere is peaceful and contemplative.",
          "was decent and proper. lotsa tourist all the time too. however you will not be impressed if you have seen the notre dames from france(marseille, lyon, strasbourg, paris) worth to take a look though since it's well located and free anyway.",
          "A lovely 'spired' cathedral with beautiful stained glass windows, both old and modern, in the heart of the city. Very peaceful and free to enter. Worth a visit - 30 minutes - an hour.",
          "Beautiful stained glass windows and a very nicely kept cathedral. The usual lighting of candles and works of art",
          "I love visiting churches of all faiths and denominations. This one does not disappoint. We came as part of a walking tour and the guide really knew her stuff to make the visit interesting.",
          "After a month of traveling through Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic and seeing so many churches and cathedrals you start too get a bit blas\u00e9 but this is one of the most impressive with very beautiful stained glass windows.",
          "It's a cathedral, of course it's worth to have a look. In less than 30 minutes you have seen everything and continue your walk through town. Don't miss the crypta in the lower part and the historic panels next to the stairs that go down.",
          "I was in Luxembourg for the weekend and attended the Sunday morning mass. The cathedral is beautiful with stained glass windows and the music during the mass was exqusite.",
          "This is an impressive building , free to enter. Worth an hour of your time when in Luxembourg. Fantastic stained glass and impressive roof.",
          "Clean, pretty building. Worth a visit & some pictures - whether u r religious or not. Stain glass window is something else.",
          "We visited on a Sunday morning so were half expecting a service to be on, we weren't dissapointed as there was a huge gathering of people worshipping, ( as well as us tourists at the back) it must have been a special mass as later in the day we saw them marching through the",
          "Been to many cities over the years & this was very nice & well worth a visit if you are in the area.",
          "A big gothic structure, really impressive. The altar was a bit fussy for my taste but I did like the fact that it felt like a working cathedral with services proceeding on spite of the heavy tourist presence. Some really impressive archir=tecture - worth a 20 min visit",
          "Doing a partial trip, we came here and we're in awe of the history in this location, overall a must see.",
          "In the heart of the city, so you shouldn't miss it if you are in Luxembourg. As the city center is not so big, you can visit all the main attractions in a day or an afternoon. This cathedral is not so big, but inside it's bigger that I expected. Wonderful place, I really loved!",
          "We saw a service in progress with all the bling and the organ was playing too and with all the colourful glass and icons, it brough the cathedral to life. The decor is outstanding",
          "It seems that there are two types of cathedrals in most Francophone countries \u2013 Notre Dammes and Sacre Cours. Well, I couldn't find a Sacre Cour in Luxembourg city, but there was a definitely a Notre Damme, or church of Our Lady. Like many of them, this one is pretty large, and",
          "Like other people have commented; this is a fairly average European cathedral. Not bad, but not great either.",
          "Really nice place. It has got a lot of history. What I enjoy on this kind of attraction is to wonder how people could build it and what kind of skills they had.",
          "a fairly average european cathedral worth a wander if you are in the area but not a lot to see. Interesting tomb in the crypt",
          "The stained glass windows were very impressive. A lovely cathedral to visit. Didn't see any information, but we didn't enter via the main door.",
          "We spent our April Bank Holiday weekend in Luxembourg and managed to visit this beautiful cathedral, very quiet and peaceful. there was a service on so unfortunately we were unable to take any pictures inside but its very well looked after clean and beautiful. id recommend",
          "A very short walk from our hotel so it was a no brainer to visit. Folding church and no close access to the altar. Numerous old fashion.confessional. Nice organ. Much plainer than many European catherals",
          "I have seen a lot of churches and this one doesn't make it to the top 10. The alter and staindglass windows are ok but the rest is pretty standard. The cripte of the royal family however is very beautiful and definatly makes a visit to this church worth while. You only get a",
          "This may be a WOW factor for someone who is seeing Notre Dame for the first time. For them, it is really impressive, but for one who has been a regular visitor to Paris and Brussels, it looks like the repitition. It does not take away the glory of grand architecture, the",
          "I had many reasons to praise Luxembourg City when I visited it many years ago long before the range of calendar dates suitable for indicating the time of my visit were made available for completing this review. One of them was the cathedral. There was a certain attachment with",
          "This National Cathedral is very nice. Seats are folding chairs and is quite large. It has old fashioned confessionals and even has a crypt. It is attached to the National Library or biblioteque. It has some interesting items inside.",
          "A very quiet and peaceful cathedral. Nice to pay a visit here whilst visiting Luxembourg. Beautiful building.",
          "Upon entering the building, the map of Luxemburg in former times took me by surprise in terms of the much larger size of the country. The crypt is a very interesting place with some unexpected corners and items. Clearly the most important church in the country.",
          "It was a nice place to visit and as a part of the history of the city very pleasant. I found the crypt most interesting and the mosaic windows in the church nice to look at.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral both inside and out were they still say mass. There is a crypt downstairs were some of the Royal family are buried.",
          "It's a large cathedral in the middle of the city. Some interesting stained glass, etc. Not worth a special trip, but if you are there already a nice side trip.",
          "The only cathedral in Luxembourg, and admission is free so no excuse not to visit. The cathedral is a mix of styles some from the 17th century to the new extension and spires built in the 1930s. The stain glass windows are beautiful. The cathedral is quiet and a lovely place to",
          "Still a working in-use place of worship, with the ability to just walk in through the main doors and visit at your own pace. Impressive structure.",
          "A very nice architectual style is dominant in Luxemburg, without many excessive decorations this beautiful cathedral stand out in the city. Free of Charge, easy to find and with a beautiful view outside of it, you can visit this place. If you're very short of time you can",
          "If you like stained glass windows then Luxembourg's Notre Dame Cathedral is beautiful. We lit candles for friends and family",
          "Very pretty and has lots of opportunities for great photos. There is also a few informative panels providing details of it's history.",
          "This cathedral is definitely worth a visit. The architecture is late Gothic with some Renaissance elements. It was made a cathedral by Pope Pius IX.",
          "We came in here on a whim, but we were glad we did! Really beautiful interior, though my wife wouldn't go down into the crypt with me. :P Definitely worth a visit for history buffs of the area. It's also free to enter, so take your time and enjoy the cool interior air!",
          "We visited this nice old Cathedral and we were impressed not only from the huge size but from the interior decoration with a lot of statues and vitreux. It is a working Catholic church and a lot of visitors come to confess and pray. The status of the Apostles are well preserved",
          "Definitely an impressive Cathedral. Much like the other Cathedrals in Europe, it has the ability to generate a lot of awe for a variety of reasons. I would suggest going into the catacombs in the basement level.",
          "No charge, quite a quiet time when we went. The stained glass windows were amazing and it was a easy place to find. It may look closed but I don't think they ever lock up. If you go on a sunny day you get some great photos of the glass",
          "Beautiful church, with incredible crypt in the basement. It is very well centrally located in near a hub of restaurants.",
          "The Cathedral is not very old. However, it has some nice epigraphies and the glass look interesting. It is in the centre of the city near to many tourist attractions.",
          "This Cathedral is close to a number of attractions, mainly the war memorial. From this cathedral you would have a great scenic view of the viaduct, garden and parks.",
          "This cathedral is huge! Although, we couldn't get into it as it was closed. So I'd recommend doing a little forward planning before visiting it!",
          "I've seen a lot of cathedrals on my travels and although it's beautiful it's nothing amazing. Close to the center and you'll no doubt pass it anyway.",
          "Gorgeous building, definitely worth a visit and if you can catch the end of a service and hear the organ music, all the better!",
          "Beautiful church, easy to locate and a must see while visiting the centre of Luxembourg. Stain glass is amazing.",
          "A must see if in Luxembourg. The iconic building can be seen from all over the city and the inside is stunning and well worth a visit.",
          "A lovely building with interesting features - well worth a visit to look around or for a few moments of contemplation.",
          "Very beautiful church integrated in the centre of the town. It has the crypt of Saint Peter in its basement. Instead on benches it has chairs for people to sit in! It is a simple church.",
          "Nothing special. It is one of must see attractions in Luxembourg. There are many other attractions close by.",
          "Go in and take a look it is worth it. The leaded glass is very. Beautiful and also the crypt is worth taking a look",
          "Lovely little cathedral open all day. No admission price and you're free to walk round at your leisure. A really good history of Luxembourg on the wall as you walk in and be sure to visit the tomb underground.",
          "Despite being small, this Notre Dame has a character of its own and the stained glass windows were very impressive. We were fortunate enough to be there during mass and the choir singing. So beautiful!",
          "An architectural excellence right in the town centre of Luxembourg.Calm,peaceful divine atmosphere overlooked by beatiful pillars and domes.Huge pipe organs is one of its biggest.",
          "The stained glass windows are worth visiting for. Absolutely stunning. The cathedral is very small and feels surprisingly modern. It is worth going down into the crypt to visit the burial chamber of the Dukes of Luxembourg. The lion statues are stunning and the blue mosaic is",
          "Do not miss visiting this cathedral if you are in the vicinity. It's beautiful inside, the painting,windows, etc...",
          "Another really beautiful cathedral in Luxembourg city. The crip down below was really beautiful and had a had beautiful artwork and statues. Cathedrals have always just had a special place in my heart.",
          "The cathedral is quite beautiful, and there is also an undercroft worth visiting. Not a lot to do in Luxembourg, so make the time to enjoy this lovely church",
          "This is easy to access from the main road. The view is nice from out side. We did not go inside. Many people were going in side. Probably it is open to public.",
          "You will find here many elements that you would expect any gothic cathedral in Europe to have : stained glass windows, high ceilings, organs. The building was extended in the 20th century so one can easily spot the layout of the original church and later extension.",
          "Very beautiful cathedral both inside and out. Very peaceful inside and very quaint. Definitely worth visiting",
          "This cathedral is absolutely gorgeous! It's quiet and awe-inspiring inside with beautiful vaulted ceilings and striking stained glass windows. It's very easy to spend lots of time wondering around taking in all the beauty. Definitely a must see for anyone who loves cathedrals or",
          "This cathedral left me speechless and amazed. The cathedral is inspiring and definitely worth a visit. I am not a practicing catholic myself, but I very much appreciated the cathedral.",
          "Lots of history and beauty at this church. Tours held for anyone walking in off street. Small entrance fee well worth it. There is hand held audio devices for those who don't want to join a tour group.",
          "This cathedral is built in two different styles because it was renewed! Yet, these styles fit well together! There you can see superb superb stained glass windows which enlighten the cathedral. The ceiling is quite high as to reach Heaven and to make us feel we are connected to",
          "We arrived to the city early in the morning. As it was cold and raining, the beautiful cathedral was just perfect to spend some time.",
          "Old Gothic church with interesting architecture. Worth a visit during the day if you're around the city area.",
          "Luxembourg's Notre Dame Cathedral is a pleasant, quiet cathedral with some beautiful stained glass windows. It's not as large or spectacular as some cathedrals elsewhere in Europe, but the lack of crowds is a definite plus. We made a quick 20-minute visit while walking around",
          "Very beautiful cathedral. It has everything one expects in a catholic cathedral and is open for visitors during the day. Inside the cathedral one may light one of the provided candles or pray. I especially loved the old, colored windows.",
          "We went here on the city tour and I was glad to see it. The inside is lovely and it wasn't as cold as some Cathedrals are. I would definitely recommend dropping by and seeing it.",
          "Interesting Cathedral, it was free to get in. Lovely candels to light. Worth popping in. There were books you could buy as a guide book for a few euros.",
          "Stands tall as a gate to Luxembourg township. Not too touristy so take your time walking through the artefacts and take in the history of the place.",
          "Luxembourg played it safe with Notre Dame. It follows (I won't say copies) the classical patterns of catholic european churches of the region, and thus didn't risk failure. A necessary part of a traditionally catholic country",
          "If you are in the neigbourhood than visit the Notre Dame. If not, you would not miss a thing. Perhaps we are spoiled but we certainly have seen much nicer churches, cathedrals, etc.",
          "The beautiful cathedral in the centre of town features stunning lead glass windows which light up when the sun shines through. In December the cathedral hosts a free mid day concert.",
          "I have been to cathedrals throughout Europe and this one was unspectacular. If you miss it don't worry. I would have liked to attend Mass there;maybe that would change my opinion.",
          "It is a large and beautiful church and it has a great history; I have seen it several times and I recommend it to all lovers of architecture, art or religion. The stone design, the stained coloured glass and the distribution of areas inside create a special and spiritual spot",
          "We had an excellent tour guide to explain this beautiful cathedral and it greatly enhanced our visit.",
          "I arrived five minutes after a concert had been. I was not allowed in and persuaded to buy tickets for the evening one! Churches I gather are in crisis as are not so popular!",
          "This cathedral has a feeling of space and openness providing a haven from the hustle and bustle outside. A brief history on the wall as you enter tells you about both the Cathedral and the development of Luxembourg. I know very little of the history of Luxembourg and found this",
          "As with most older church the design and trimmings are beautiful and the Notre Dame Cathedral in Luxembourg is not exception.",
          "Wonderful architecture and a pleasant place to visit. Doesn't take long to walk around but a must if you are here to take in the culture and understand some of the local heritage.",
          "Popped into this lovely church whilst visiting family for the weekend. The church is massive, we donated some money to light some candles and walked around. Also bought a postcard. Would have loved to have seen a service.",
          "Cathedral is beautiful but not outstanding. A much more interesting facet is the map of the the original duchy of Luxembourg and the Protectress of the country in the cathedral. Most of the territory has been taken over by other countries so only a quarter of the original size",
          "We passed in front of the cathedral three times, before realizing it was indeed the cathedral of the capital. Similarly to the city (and the whole country) it's a very unremarkable building, neither beautiful nor ugly, and oddly similar to thousands of other churches around",
          "Cathedral in the heart of Luxembourg City was built between 1613 and 1621. It has a beautiful stained glass and is a \"must visit\" for all lovers of history.",
          "The Notre Dame Cathedral is quite beautiful and, if opened, I strongly recommnend a visit to the Crypt.",
          "when touring the city stopping here on the way to the place de la constitution/gelle fra is a must. of course if you have the possibility, attend a service, it gives you more insight into the spirit of the Luxembourgish notre dame.",
          "Beautiful cathedral we visited on a Sunday morning during services. I loved the bells and seeing the children leave their Sunday School classes. A must see!",
          "Ok for wet day.not much to say because not much to see.concerts on regularly,organ almost deafened ng",
          "This is an amazing and beautiful cathedral in the middle of the city. Enjoy the vitrals and the ambiente inside. It is a gorgeous place to be and free of charge.",
          "I enjoyed looking at the stained glass in the cathedral. It is quite dark inside the cathedral as they don't use masses of modern lights, and this adds to the atmosphere inside the cathedral.",
          "When visiting Luxembourg, you'll probably end up here because it is a Cathedral, it is free, and there isn't a huge amount of other stuff to do. Apart from the lovely doors and interesting stained glass, the main level isn't particularly spectacular. Downstairs, however, there",
          "Not breathtaking compared to many other European cathedrals but surely you can stop by during passing.",
          "I love looking around churches and this was no exception. However it was incredibly dark in the church so difficult to see some details. I particularly liked the carved pillars in the nave and at the church entrance there were votive candles which gave off quite a heat as you",
          "The cathedral is very attractive, well maintained and in spite of the number of visitors manages to remain peaceful. It was a nice place for a reflective few minutes having spent the morning walking around the walls.",
          "OK, many Cathedrals in Italy are probably more impressive and so is the Notre Dame in Paris but we appreciated the Luxemburg very much for its beauty and beautiful location, overlooking the city and the Vall\u00e9e de la P\u00e9trusse.",
          "This surely must be one of the essential visits to the City. A beautiful space with some interesting history. Take time to enjoy the peace and spend time with your God (whoever you conceive him/her to be)",
          "We were expecting to pay to go in, especially as most places like this in the UK charge. But it was all free. The stained glass is beautiful and it's all very ornate in true catholic style. People were free to wander around, take pictures and pay a few cents to light a candle. A",
          "We visited Notre Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg as couples. The church interior and exterior was magnificent even though it was not as big as the Notre Dame Cathedral France. One of the must see iconic places in Luxembourg. Also, the entrance fees is free. Overall: 4 Stars",
          "Attractive cathedral that's worth a quick visit if you're in the neighborhood. Organ music played at 11.00 on Saturday mornings",
          "We had a very short visit to the cathedral during a walking tour of Luxembourg City. The stained glass windows are lovely",
          "This notte fame Luxembourg strategically located in the Main Street close to down town... It's quite similar with notte dame in other cities like Paris but smaller in size.",
          "This is an old cathedral, as old as the city itself and has grown with the city. It is not as beautiful as the other classical European churches but it has an aura of its own. I believe people from nearby countries also come here to pray.",
          "The altar is bejewelled with windows, candles and lights while the rest of the cathedral is left bare in a beautiful contrast. Meditative spaces at the back for prayer and contemplation away from the tourists.",
          "A beautiful and serene church, a must visit, if ever in Luxembourg. Fantastic Stained Glass windows with religious pictures all over. Amazingly beautiful. The church is full of history. Well worth a visit, even if you have no religious connections, but for the sheer beauty",
          "The outside is rather plain but the inside is overwhelmingly busy with very dark and heavy stained glass windows, nothing special about the ceilings, and the cathedral itself is very dark inside. The altar is overwhelming with so much stuff everywhere. Maybe I've seen too many",
          "If there is one place you visit when in Luxembourg then it has to be the Notre Dame Cathedral. With such beauty and serenity you can almost forget that this is a place of worship and has served the spiritual needs of thousands over the centuries. It is breathtaking and you must",
          "People say don\u2019t judge a book by its cover. I\u2019ll say the same thing about this cathedral. From the outside, it looks rather nondescript. But inside, we were stunned. The whole interior is delicately painted \u2013 on the columns, the walls and the ceiling. There\u2019re stained glass",
          "Typical European church. We thought it rather beautiful though there are much better in Europe. We found the crypt area with the monarchy of Luxembourg buried to be rather interesting.",
          "Amazing place full of history of the country. The best is to take a guide. There is so much to miss unless you have guidance.",
          "A place of must see while in Luxembourg. It's simply beautiful with wonderful paintings all over. If have time don't miss the choir singing. It's awesome you will feel as God is there somewhere near you.",
          "The church was beautiful and had a stunning altar. I was impressed by the baroque carvings in the back by the organ loft.",
          "Being a non practicing Catholic, the Cathedral's visit brings me back to my cultural background (Judeo Christian). It gives time to reflect on my life (71 years old) & reinforce my feelings toward the basis of our Civilization: Sharing, Compassion, Empathy, Forgiving, Together",
          "An absolutely beautiful cathedral. Went to Sunday mass and was overwhelmed by the beautiful organ music, Gregorian Chant sung by the choir and inspiring service. A must see for all church-going Catholics and anyone inspired by the old world cathedrals.",

          "Lovely place centrally located and very peaceful. Beautiful interior. Only downside nobody available to purchase good for sale in display cabinets which was a shame",
          "A must see for anyone who enjoys church architecture. The stained glass windows are very different from what you would seen in most cathedrals",
          "Attend mass here and experience the soul stirring organ music. Surely God must be listening. The cathedral itself is very nice, but not one of the most beautiful in Europe. You'll find a good time line of the history of Luxembourg in the foyer of the church. Take a look at the",
          "This was our first attraction that we visited in Luxembourg. What a gem! The windows are magnificent and worth a visit. It's free to the public too.",
          "I visited the Cathedral as part of a two hour walking tour of the city. It is very impressive and if you are in Luxembourg it is very much worth a visit and you should note that there is a basement area with the crypts that you can see as well",

          "This cathedral is representative of the country. Yes it's a real state, (cathedral), but it is easily dwarfed by all it's neighbors in grandeur and beauty.",
          "Another beautiful European church. Stained glass is very nice. Altar is very beautiful as well. Organ in the rear is very impressive.",
          "A nice place to relax and gather your thoughts. Wonderful interior in very serene surroundings. The Cathedral is located near the Luxembourgish parliamentary houses as well as an array of other interesting sights",
          "This is a must if your are in the city. Our small and beutiful cathedral should not be missed. You can either visit youself or as part of the Luxembourg City Tour, which is available in English, French or German. Information of the the tour can be obtained at the Luxembourg City",

          "...impressing from inside and outside too... ...during Octave weeks you find many believing persons and ceremonies...",
          "A strange catholic catedral. With only the chairs resembling that faith. It is interesting to visit and a new thin to add to the doversity of the humans",
          "Very ornate and beautiful inside. The doors were massive and very heavy to open. With lots of people visiting, the church was still quiet.",
          "certainly worth a visit, the tomb of the royal family in the crypt is certainly worth the visit alone",
          "Pretty impressive . Small compared to other cathedral in Europe but has good architecture and window paintings . Do visit basement of cathedral if this place is on your visit list.",
          "Some of the features of this cathedral are unlike most others, such as the engraved pillars and the elaborate Our Lady display with all the swinging incense burners. There was a sign saying there were tours in English, so I asked, and as the only English speaker there I was",
          "My friend and I were walking along toward Hotel de Ville and found ourselves in front of the beautiful Notre Dame. Free to enter and look around (and take photos). Beautiful architecture and you can help but just stare at the amazing stained glass windows. Worth a visit as",

          "This was a wonderful cathedral to visit. It had a very reverent atmosphere and every acted accordingly. Make sure when you visit that you are dressed appropriately as they do have signs that denote proper attire. The sanctuary itself was beautiful and the altar and windows took",
          "A beautiful cathedral like most of the Notre Dame's. Nice to visit. Very central it has a spectacular organ. Situated next to the cities' Bibliotheca.",
          "I could have sat in this cathedral for hours. It was so relaxing and tranquil. Rustic, with impressive lighting and some beautiful frescos. Definitely worth a visit. Point of difference is the dressing of the altar... almost Boho style.",
          "Much more beatiful inside than outside. Not so beatiful and big as Notre Dame in Paris. The only cathedral in Luxembourg.",
          "Relatively smaller than some of the cathedrals in other big cities in Europe. Again not small in itself and beautiful too but others I've seen in Madrid and Prague were massive compared to. Worth a visit in Luxembourg though, located at the city centre.",
          "This is a really nice cathedral. Not too grand but it has its charm. Too many tourist group today though so ruin it a bit :D",
          "Interesting architectural attraction in a city of contrasts. Modern and old blend together in a unique style. It's a must on your list for visiting attractions in Luxemburg",
          "This Cathedral was stunning. We have visited many churches in Germany, and this by far, is the most beautiful.",
          "A centre point of Luxembourg is the Notre Dame Cathedral. It is s very imposing attractive building with an even more impressive interior. We visited just prior to a service and sat in the congregation centrally which gave a brilliant view of the alter and fabulous stained glass",
          "It is decorated incredibly, the light around the altar and all surroundings of the altar where amazing. It is located very close to the Palace of Justice and right in front of the viaduct.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral with awsome stained glasses. If you are in Luxembourg it us worth of seeing, just in the center of old town",
          "We saw everyone going in, so we did too! It's another beautiful church in Europe! The altar is impressively large with stained glasses! It's free and good on a rainy day!",
          "Again this was part of our Luxembourg walking tour and similar to the other Notre Dam Cathedrals we have viewed in other countries.",
          "Really beautiful church, and very good location. Just behind the town hall. And insithe the building its really beautiful, i stay there for coulpe minutes.",
          "This church is my favorite Notre Dame and it is in one of the hidden gems in Europe, Luxembourg. The shops, food, people, and this church make it a must SEE!!!",
          "nice cathedral, not overdone and accesible. recommand to visit during the festivities for the holx Mary in summet",
          "I enjoy visiting churches and cathedrals and stand inside/outside in awe admiring what a man is able to create with ones hands. Not to mention that usually such architectural masterpieces were done hundreds of years ago. Then you have the sculptors and painters who decorate the",
          "Impressive from the outside, however due to national holiday, visitors were not allowed. We will definitely visit inside at a later visit to the city.",
          "Admission is free and that's a bonus. The stained glass is beautiful. Having been to the Notre dame in Paris and in Strasbourg this one isn't in the same league.",
          "Even though it is a smaller scale cathedral, this Jesuit church was built between 1613 and 1621. The cathedral also contains the crypt where many members of the Grand Ducal dynasty are buried.",
          "It's a usual, common in shape and decoration cathedral as in many European cities. I think that is poorer in impressions than other cathedrals in Italy or France.",
          "Though not huge the cathedral in Luxembourg is worth a visit. The decorated pillars are interesting. When entering the building the nave seems of a moderate size but when you get to the front you will find the extension and the two large transepts make an imposing sight. The",
          "The church is nice, but the major point for a non religious person is to go on Saturdays (not every Saturday happens) and listed to the organ concerts... Fantastic!!",
          "The Cathedral was peaceful and welcoming to all, The alter was one of the most unusual and beautiful Ive ever seen. We lit a candle and read the history of Luxembourgh through the ages...We were reluctant to leave.",
          "This should be in everyones list of things to see in Luxembourg. It is The only cathedral in Luxembourg and is baroque style.",
          "This was a very peaceful place to visit- I enjoyed just sitting and appreciating the reverence, as well as lighting a candle for my family. The stained glass windows were beautiful, too!",
          "A very nice cathedral with wonderful history and stained glass. Free entry, but it is a working church, so silent touring after the services is the way to go",
          "We have beautiful churches and cathedrals in the US, but to see the huge cathedrals in Europe built in the 1600's or earlier, well, they just take your breath away.",
          "Arrived here when the walk was on. Sat in on the service - terrific way to be reminded about the Christ was about.",
          "Free trip inside the cathedral, which is lovely especially in rainy weather. I particularly enjoyed the lions' faces on the pedestals at the enterance.",
          "This is a spectacular structure, built around the 16th Century, love the Gothic architecture with some Rennaissance elements. Great stonework and Steples.",
          "We did not do the tour, we just had a walk around. The cathedral is impressive with some amazing carvings and stained glass. And so peaceful.",
          "This is easy to find in the old city and worth a visit. It's not the most stunning of cathedrals on a world scale, but as the place of worship for the Grand Dukes, it's full of interest. Check out the crypt in particular.",
          "The Jesuits did an amazing job with this one. A truly beautiful place of worship, take time out to sit and take in the beauty.",
          "Very pretty church. The stain glass is very pretty especially when the sun is shining through them. It is also a nice place to rest after touring the city.",
          "The church is beautiful and quiet. We enjoyed the stained glass and took a moment to light candles in honor of our family.",
          "We've passed the tour so we probably did not catch the best of the church, as building looks good, well maintained. The place is pretty touristy, so be prepared for large crowds",
          "A 'must see' in the heart of Luxembourg. This is a beautiful cathedral. If you do the walking tour from the Luxembourg Tourist Office, this is part of the tour.",
          "Notre Dame Cathedral happened to be the first sightseeing object we met in Luxembourg - as soon as we left our hotel and crossed the bridge to Old Town voila there it was so after we just looked at each other it was obvious we couldn't merely pass it without entering. Don't miss",
          "I visit the Cathedral at least once a year with my wife. It is very peaceful and calming to be in this great building.",
          "Because it wasn't built as one but as a church and then a school and then became a cathedral... Therefore, the style is very different. And the stained glass are all in excellent condition. We were lucky enough to see the Virgin Mary still dressed for the pilgrimage following",
          "As soon as you enter the cathedral you smell the incense, what adds something extra (although, for us, we love the scent). Tranquil and peaceful place in the hustle and bustle of the capital.",
          "Cathedrals are very often admirable. This one is no exception. It is absolutely amazing and definitely worth a visit. Remember to bring small change in case you want to light a candle for someone...",
          "Don't get me wrong, this is a nice cathedral, but if you travel thru Europe, this Notre Dame will not impress you. Not the size, not the architecture.",
          "We walked in during a service, so we didn't stay long. The stained glass windows are gorgeous and so was the rest of the building - inside and out. A must-see for your time in town.",
          "We only stopped into the church for a few minutes to take a look inside, but it was really lovely! A good stop off to see some wonderful artistry.",
          "Pleasant atmosphere and beautiful paintings in the glasses! Very good place to go when you are in the Luxembourg centre.",
          "Worth a look and quick visit. Impressive, as churches go, but seen grander Cathedrals. Some good historical notes within on the founding of the Cathedral and the development of Luxembourg.",
          "It was the start of Pilgrimage Week and so not open until the afternoon, but well worth the wait. The alter area was draped and decorated in Yellow and gold to take your breath away. But the stain glass windows that greet you are absolutely amazing along with the architecture as",
          "We have visited the Notre Dame Cathedral in Luxembourg virtually on each visit, which is yearly however this is experience I recommend to anyone. It never ceases to overwhelm and a calm descends upon one in these peaceful, awe inspiring surroundings. Beautiful glass stained",
          "Is an amazing place to visit in luxembourg! Great architecture! The inside is very interesting and beautiful!!!",
          "We happened to stop by here while exploring the city. Very pretty church, stained glass windows were gorgeous. Loved being able to sit in here and look at the architecture and interesting history.",
          "I'm sure it's a must see if you're in the city but it isn't the most spectacular that I've seen once you park your car you might as well see you as much as you can it's funny that they sell souvenirs here if you think about it",
          "This cathedral, as with all places of worship was magnificent. The stained glass windows catch the light really well. A truly beautiful place to visit and have a quite reflection.",
          "Our Lady of Luxembourg, as this cathedral is also known, is a nice cathedral in it's own right, but not on the scale of Ulm, Munich or Cologne. Perhaps it's its \"newness\" (started in the early 1600's), or the fact that it's not in the Gothic vein, but it lacks the \"wow factor\"",
          "My wife and I easily walked into this impressive cathedral whilst out for a stroll. Not overly opulent thankfully, but just right. Lovely stained glass windows and spacious. We found the whole experience very peaceful as we lit candles in memory of loved ones passed on.",
          "This building must be seen. Wander around the entire exterior; there is a gorgeous park at the back of the building that will provide a completely different experience of the structure. GO EARLY. My friend actually attended a Mass before 8am and she said it was one of the most",
          "Fine place, interesting decoration, but nothing special compared to the level of other cathedrals you see in Europe",
          "It is a gorgeous church with great panting on the walls. The wall carpets, which are unusual to see in a church, are very impressive and should not be missed",
          "Nice place to sit and watch for a while. Quiet and respectful, modern ish building with not much to excite architectural or history buffs.",
          "Very large church/cathedral even though I'm not religious I found this place impressive. Not a place to spend a great of time, but worth a visit if in Luxembourg City",
          "If I am going on a trip to a new city, I always visit the churches of the town. I would rank this one as an ordinary one. There are better churches which are located in a better surrounding. Even if the church is beside a street, it has a quiet atmosphere, which is good.",
          "Lovely cathedral. Impressive looking. Worth having a look at. In the main city area anyways so worth a stop off.",
          "As it's the largest church in Luxembourg, it was definitely worth a stop. We were lucky enough to go at a time when we could hear the organ playing.",
          "Excellent place to stop, also, check out the Saints Tomb. Very close to all the other sites around the Grund.",
          "Attended Friday evening Mass. It was a beautiful experience. The line was not so bad to get in and then afterward we had time to take in the whole cathedral.",
          "Close to all main attractions of the city, it is worth a visit. The main altar and stained glass windows are gorgeous.",
          "Extremely beautiful and well kept cathedral! I love the stain glass windows and architecture. Definitely walk towards the front of the church.",
          "This 17th century cathedral is originally a Jesuit church. When Luxembourg became a bisdom in 1870, it was elevated to be the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. It has interesting historic decorations, and the 20th century enlargement goes well with the original 17th century parts.",
          "It is a traditional stop on Your visit in romantic Paris. And it is not hard to see why with its long history, importance and dominant place in the heart of the most romantic city. As cathedrals goes it is not as unusual and I would recommend Metz, Strasbourg or Reims more. But",
          "It's worth calling in, but nothing spectacular here. The crypt is interesting, and there's a good overview of the building history"

        "wiki": "The Grand Ducal Palace (Luxembourgish: Groussherzogleche Palais, French: Palais grand-ducal, German: Gro\u00dfherzogliches Palais) is a palace in Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg.  It is the official residence of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and where he performs most of his duties as head of state of the Grand Duchy.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was first the city hall of Luxembourg from 1572 to 1795, the seat of the prefecture of the D\u00e9partement des For\u00eats in 1795, and then the headquarters of the Luxembourg Government in 1817.From 1817, the palace became the residence of the Governor, the representative of the Dutch Grand Dukes.  As such, it was used by Prince Henry, during his time as Lieutenant-Representative of Luxembourg.  The building's interior was renovated in 1883, in preparation of a visit by Grand Duke William III and his wife, Grand Duchess Emma.\nWith the accession of the House of Nassau-Weilburg in 1890, the palace was reserved exclusively for the Grand Duke and his family.  Under Grand Duke Adolphe, it was comprehensively renovated and a new wing, containing family rooms and guest accommodation, was built by the Belgian architect G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bordiau and the Luxembourgian state architect, Charles Arendt.During the German occupation in the Second World War, the Grand Ducal Palace was used by the Nazis as a concert hall and tavern.  Much of the palace's furniture, art collections and jewels were ruined. Large swastika flags were hung down the front. With the return of Grand Duchess Charlotte from exile in 1945, the palace once again became the seat of the Grand Ducal Court.\nUnder the supervision of Charlotte, the palace was redecorated during the 1960s.  It was thoroughly restored between 1991 and 1996.  The interior of the Palace has been regularly renovated to match modern tastes and standards of comfort.\nFrom 1945 to 1966 the Grand Ducal Guard mounted ceremonial guard duties at the palace.  From 1966 to today soldiers of the military of Luxembourg perform guard duties.\n\n\n== The Palace today ==\nAs the official residence of the Grand Duke, the palace is used by him in the exercise of his official functions.  He and the Grand Duchess, together with their staff, have their offices at the palace, and the state rooms on the first floor are used for a variety of meetings and audiences.  On Christmas Eve, the Grand Duke's Christmas message is broadcast from the Yellow Room.\nForeign heads of state are accommodated at the palace, as guests of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess, during official visits to Luxembourg, and the Ballroom is the setting for state banquets in their honour.  Throughout the year, numerous other receptions take place at the palace, such as the New Year's reception given for members of the Government and the Chamber of Deputies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of castles in Luxembourg\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLe Palais Grand Ducal",

          "Not as grand as palaces in other countries, but still very interesting to see, at least from the outside. The architecture is nice and it's pretty easy to reach from the main road. You can probably spend at most 10 minutes looking at it from the outside, but that's fine because there's other stuff to see nearby.",
          "Probably the best palace in all of Luxembourg.\nI don't know how many palaces there are but it would have to be pretty good to beat this one.\nAlso it has guards that march around a bit similar to Buckingham palace but less intimidating and with out the bid furry hats.",

          "This is a pretty building and considering there is not much in Luxembourg to see, this is a must for any tourist. People often ask what there is to do in Luxembourg and I say, Place D\u2019arms, the Grund, and the Grand Dukes palace. If he\u2019s in the building you will see",
          "It is huge and beautiful. In fact it seems that the hole street and all it blocks belongs to the Duque.",
          "Palace of the Grand Dukes is a nice structure but of a much smaller scale when compared with other palaces. There are two guards at the kiosks outside the building. Nearly all the tourists take photos on these guards while visiting this spot.",
          "Found it round a back street , doesn't compare very well to other Royal residences . Only 2 guards outside",
          "A beautiful building located in a small square. In my opinion, the house is a bit confined, so that you can not get a proper impression.",
          "The building is beautiful. It\u2019s just around the corner of the cathedral. Cozy space that allows you to have a sip of hot chocolate while looking the at guard marching.",
          "Beautiful building in the city centre of Luxembourg in the upper town, very popular among tourists and change of guests ceremony is nice",
          "This is the Grand Dukes palace. Nice to look at for a few minutes, get some photos. Magnificent piece of architecture",
          "Plenty of tourits take photos daily of this monument. It is a unique building in Luxembourg. Is also well maintained and kept in good conditions.",
          "Palais Grand Ducal is situated in the heart of Luxembourg City. I have never seen a royal/ducal palace so close to the center of a city with shops, bars near to it. Interesting. Be aware, the Palace is open over the Summer months namely July and August only. If you are in",
          "Grand Dukes Palace is definitely worth checking out! Its quite stunning and you may even catch the changing of the guards while you are there! It is also close to the Chocolate House where you can get the most amazing hot chocolate!",
          "The Grand Ducal Palace is an official residence of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. Under the Grand Duke Adolphe, the palace was completely renovated and a new wing was added containing family rooms and guest quarters. During the WW2, the Germans used the palace as a tavern. Much",
          "Luxembourg as is mix of Gothic and Baroque architecture and you would many building in the similar lines. Really nothing great to see Place that too alone from outside . its under maintenance till Mid Nov. Also Guard of honour is so simple that can not hold you. Square is good",
          "We took the 9am English speaking tour of the palace. It was scheduled in advance so we could make this particular one. We went through their security and had to check our backpack. Photos were not allowed. A docent conducted the tour and talked much about the family/families",
          "We were visiting Luxembourg for a weekend visit and managed to reserve the very last tour of the season (2nd September) to the Grand Ducal Palace. Situated in teh heart of Luxembourg City, you make your reservation on-line and then pick-up your tickets, swapping your on-line",
          "I was just walking and taking photos and i passed this building and it looked beautiful. Only a day later i realised it is a tourist point when i checked my tripadvisor. It is just another beautiful building.",
          "Beautiful details on this hidden palace:) Didn\u2019t get the time to go in as we were in a very short visit, but it was impressive architecture and made us feel royal (which the guardian patrol & etc) and \u201cback in time\u201d. Next time surely we\u2019ll explore more of it! ( I understood it\u2019s",
          "Passed the Palace during a day trip to Luxembourg City. This is perhaps one if the most beautiful palaces that I have seen in Europe. Try to get a peek of the palace if you are in the area.",
          "The Ducal Palace is small but packed with interesting furniture, art pieces and history. Located in the middle of Luxembourg city, it is easy to find and visit. Booking is necessary since the demand for it is pretty high but it is worth of the visit. Perfect for history",
          "I read that the palace is only open to the public in July and August, you must book online or through the tourist office (which I did) and there are just 2 tours per day in English, at midday and 5pm You go to the back entrance to meet the guide, Michaela was knowledgable and",
          "The visit of an 1 hour was short but the guide was very motivated and friendly. It was super exciting for the adults and even the kids were thrilled by the visit.",
          "This is a small but really nice Palace. Different decoration styles coming from the different periods where it has been built. The Grand Duc still works there so practical and well furnished. The guided tours are lasting 1 hour. Perfect timing. Some really interesting old guns",
          "I am not writing this review to rate this but to tell other travelers to BOOK online before heading here as you can not go in without a ticket. If you aren't staying for too long, then just admire it from the outside.",
          "Finding information at this site is really hard - there are a couple of signs outside locked gates which don\u2019t really tell you anything helpful. A guard told me to come back at 2pm but then the tour was already full - my neutral rating is based on this - it might be great",
          "So glad I went when it was open for visiting. Outside it is not outstanding, but so interesting to see where it is, just right there on the street . The guided tour was fascinating, but then I love places like this. The security was good, and the tour guide very entertaining",
          "We saw this Palace just to the right of the city center and saw some guards. Later they did the changing of the guard and after it was finished we tried to go inside but we weren\u2019t allowed. It was a bit disappointing but that\u2019s life so we moved on to the next attraction.",
          "This is one of the places that you do visit when you go for a tour to Luxembourg ....I did not go with any tour I was travelling solo but as I got down at the station I pick chappal brochure with the places to see in Luxembourg and I found my way to the same ....this Palace is",
          "The Palace is not far from the main shopping areas in the city centre. It is a large building with lovely ornate architecture and soldiers standing guard outside. We did not have time to visit inside the palace so I can only comment on what I saw outside.",
          "So first we were there in June and it is only open to public visits July and August, so can only comment on outside The Palace is quite pretty but pretty small (you can walk around the whole outside in a few minutes) and next to Parliament. One can watch guards marching and",
          "Very nice, gorgeous architecture. A must see in the heart of the city where the Prince comes. Good bars and restaurants in this area. Nice to relax amidst the beautiful building!",
          "Quite a grand building with beautiful architecture. You can visit inside and even view the changing of the guards or just sit in a cafe and admire the structure from outside.",
          "Just a nice architecture building. I could not see the guards though the guard house was empty. Only when the flag is up the Prince is there",
          "Quite grand building with the architecture typical to Luxembourg. You can visit inside and even view the changing of the guards. We preferred to admire the building from the chocolate and cake shop outside!",
          "Very nice building, impressive architecture and historical value. It is very close to Place Guillaume and the Notre Dame Cathedral. You feel so normal, no impressive security measures, not too many guards (i saw none, in fact...but maybe because it was a rainy day...). To be",
          "Visited yesterday . Palace of the Grand Duke was closed so can't recommend how it inside. Outside building is nice build 1572-1795 headquarters of the government 1817",
          "A wonderful place to visit even if just to watch the guards parade and protect the building. Worth walking round to admire the grandeur of the building which I believe is still active as a main residence. Also next to a fabulous cake shop!",
          "We took pictures and visited the palace from the outside...didn't go in and not sure if there were tours or not actually. It was a chilly and rainy day when we were there and we popped into The Chocolate House across the street for hot chocolate which was nice. The changing of",
          "We were here on Easter Monday and it was good to see the guards march up and down then a new guard came out and they changed Brill to watch. We really enjoyed it",
          "This building really empowers the city! It is really nice and beautiful! You should definitely cross the bridge to visite it",
          "One of the highlights of my trip to Luxembourg! Interested in sights and history, and this does not disappoint. Very clean and majestic in its surroundings. Worth the visit.",
          "Lots of great architecture and the changing of the guard. Great for pictures but not much happening. Still it is a must see for your first trip to the city.",
          "You won\u2019t miss this place on your route around the historical center of Luxembourg. Smallest palace I\u2019ve seen in my life but very nice.",
          "Fantastic building, but when visiting in Winter is closed to visitors so I can only comment on the outside!!",
          "In all honesty we only took a look from the outside. A guard was on duty and not really approachable but we saw all we need too to appreciate the historical value of the Grand Duke of Lux's residence.",
          "In its function as the city residence of the Grand Ducal family, the Palace is a beautiful creation situated right in the core of the Old Town. Well worth a visit to see the soldiers marching in front of it. It's only open for the public in the summer.",
          "This is a cute little palace, with two soldiers marching in front of it. This is a very interesting sight. make sure to pass by, it is amazing.",
          "To be honest, I didn\u2019t recognize the palace until i am in front of the gate. It was the security guard who made me realize that was a palace (who else\u2019s have a royal guard?) It was hard for me to recognize it because the palace is a little bit small for a palace. It\u2019s more like",
          "Walking tour of old city is a must went to this building , not able to enter, pedestrian area outside so able to take photos and learn about from guide",
          "Not much to see / There are guards outside sometime . Building is nicely restored. If your in a area its worth a walk by .",
          "The palace is nice. A gothic style and there is a cafe in front where you can have a cup of hot chocolate",
          "Only during summer months I think around July can you get inside. Other times you only look from the outside.",
          "The architecture of the palace is elegant and understated. It goes very well with the rest of the city. We sort of walked past it without noticing it, which is kind of funny but great to see that the palace is so accessible and close to people. There are very pleasant guards and",
          "The Palace of the Grand Dukes is very pretty and definitely should be on your to do list of Luxembourg!",
          "this is the home of the grand duke of luxembourg and is a very impressive building.it is almost fairytale like in it's appearance.it is a big building standing out amongst it's surroundings.if the duke is in residence,the flag on the roof is flown at full mast.got to be seen if",
          "This building is ornate and makes for a nice photo opportunity. It's definitely worth catching a glimpse before heading to the center for dinner.",
          "It was one of the most boring historical visits I have ever done in my life. The guide was also not particularly good, so it made things worse. Nothing much to see and learn except fact about the Luxembourghish royal family. Definitely not interesting!",
          "i liked this place. a lot of history around. nice and colourful buildings. a lot of shops and cafes near. u can walk here and see all those easily. clean and nice area.",
          "This area of the historic centre is home to all the arms of government for Luxembourg; certainly a slimmed down set of buildings befitting the pint-sized nature of the country. The palace is particularly prominent and while a charming enough building the most prominent sight",
          "Beautiful palace from outside in the center of Luxembourg. Unfortunately it was not possible to go inside. Around the area there are a lot of good bars and restaurants.",
          "I agree with those who have commented that this is a beautiful building with little else going for it.",
          "Like a fairy tale palace, but closed to visitors. Watching the changing of the guard was a real treat - only one guard!",
          "Officially Palais Grand Ducal, this is the residence of the Grand Duke and his family, when they are in the city as they also live in the country. The building is conveniently located in what is called downtown Luxembourg City. When the building is open to the public, you will",
          "This is the official residence of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg and the state rooms are used for a variety of meetings and audiences. The exterior of the building is very nice, however since it is not in an open square it is very difficult to take a picture of the whole building",
          "We just walked by and saw it from the outside but it was incredible. There was an armed guard patrolling in front. We can only imagine what it must look like on the inside.",
          "The building itself is beautiful, in an interesting area as far as \"palaces\" go. Right across from a Chinese restaurants and a souvenir shop. It's unassuming, and easy to get too on foot. Interesting history behind the building, especially during the nazi invasion of",
          "This palace is more beautiful in person than the photos show. It like Cinderella's Castle laid out sideways. My wife was lucky enough to see the Grand Duke and the Prime Minister coming and going from the palace. Very impressive.",
          "This Palace is the city residence of the Grand Ducal family, it is located in the Old Town. Formerly it was built as the town hall of the city, but destroyed by a gunpowder explosion (1554), the Parliament was built as an annex in 1859. Since 1890 the main building has been the",
          "Tours of the Palace of the Grand Dukes during the summer months (you must buy your tickets in the Tourist Information Office on Place Guillaume II) and provides an in-depth look at the public function rooms. Interestingly, the Royal Family does not live here - it is a 'working",
          "Only open during the summer, great fa\u00e7ade, elegant interiors and modern compare to other elaborated palaces ... great art, tapestries and tasteful furniture .",
          "I was pleasantly surprised at the beauty of the palace and the artifacts. Situated in the main market area and surrounded by loads of restaurants and other establishments, one is bound to find the palace really a pleasant surprise. You need to take a guided tour which is offered",
          "The Palace of the Grand Dukes is a worthwhile visit in the centre. It is easy to find and walk around (when i went in August construction work was happening round a part of it). It is not as old as some palaces but still impressive and for a short window guided tours are",
          "Not as old looking as other European palaces but non of the less is an attraction in the centre of Luxembourg.",
          "Not as large as others, but access to all rooms and viewing the great colour schemes of various rooms a delight",
          "Being in the centre of the city, the Palace is easy to see from the outside and can also be seen from around the back as you walk through the cobbled streets. Tours are worthwhile doing but seem to be only available during the summer months.",
          "The Ducal palace is in the city centre in a lovely square - the building looks like it has been recently restored. If you want to go inside you need to book. You can do this at the tourist information office.",
          "We didn't get the chance to do the tour inside as we were rushing through Luxembourg but the outside is stunning to appreciate.",
          "Ducal palace of the Grand Duke in Luxembourg. Available for tours in the summer months when the Duke is on holiday. Must buy tickets in advance from the city tour office ~5 min walk away. Tours book up quickly. Lovely building with great tour guides. Cost is 12 Euro. No",
          "Interesting to see this palace, it is the only palace of a ruling Grand Duke in the world after all. In the summer you can also go inside with a guided tour, which they offer in different languages. Remember though, you have to book beforehand at the tourist office. I saw people",
          "The tour lasts about an hour and they have tours available in different languages. Tours are only on during the summer months during July and part of August, so you would need to plan ahead. The tickets were easy to get; however, you need to email the tourist office to get",
          "The Palace of the Grand Dukes tour was informative with some comic relief. It gives history of the royalty of Luxembourg",
          "We booked the 1h tour and visited the palace but we were a little disappointed as our guide spoke English with a funny german&french accent and most of the time it was very difficult to understand his explanations. The palace is quite big but the tour will go to one room on the",
          "We booked onto a tour with the tourist information office. The tour lasted one hour and you get history of Luxembourg and the grand duchy from an informative guide and get to tour the state rooms.",
          "Every summer when the Duke is on holidays with his family, it is possible to visit the palace. The Guide are very Professional et make us feel the atmosphere of the palace. I recommend to book in advance in order to have a chance to do the visit.",
          "In a corner of the shopping area lies the Castle. Take a break from shopping and take a look at the palace. An impressing building, but only to take a quick look.",
          "As a monarchist with a passion for history, this Palace was certainly on my list of places to visit when in Luxembourg. There are three tours in English per day at 09:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m. and 17:00 p.m. These tours must be booked in advance, with tickets available from the",
          "Thanks to delayed trains, we only had two hours in Luxembourg, and my brother took us here. The Palais itself was not that interesting, but the surrounding views and statues were lovely.",
          "Highlight of my trip to Luxembourg. Cost 12Euros for a guided tour. 3 in English each day. Buy your tickets from tourist information. We booked the day before. Excellent guide. Very interesting information and beautiful building. Really quaint. Treat yourself to a hot chocolate",
          "The guided tour is a great way to learn about the history if Luxembourg and the palace. Lovely visit- worth remembering that this is not a museum but a royal residence",
          "Beautiful Palace, that is very nicely decorated but not too extravagant. You can watch a soldier marching back and forth. Not a lavish palace, especially considering is the official residence of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, very beautiful, worth the visit.",
          "I assumed this would be a big draw and we headed there straight away - no access - you have to pre-book a tour Given our general disappointment with Luxembourg City and its lack of interest in tourism this was not really a big surprise",
          "I wouldn't know. You can only see it 3 weeks out of the year during the summer when the Duke is off somewhere else. The first day they were opened for tours this year would have been the Thursday of the week I was there. I was there on Tuesday. Missed it by two days. If you're",
          "Im aware that most people would recommend to visit places like palaces or churches. I must admit that some palaces n churches are very beautiful. Palace of Grand Dukes in Luxembourg for me is only worth a walk because there is not much to see. It stands out because of its",
          "Great to see from outside but shame there was no guard to see. Fascinating architecture. Easy to find.",
          "The guard out front is relatively unremarkable for being low key and less drama to ceremony than many in Europe and at Arlington Cemetery in the states. If the Chamber of Deputies is convening or some special occasion, security tightens and the press will appear. Interesting",
          "Right in the middle of the city stands magnificent piece of architecture, Palais Grand Ducal, home to the Royal family. A Chocolate shop right opposite to this palace is a must for famous Hot chocolate drink.",
          "This is the Grand Dukes palace.Nice looking building but that's about all there is.Buck Palace it ain't.I felt sorry for the poor guard who was marching up and down in this hot weather.There are a couple of blue and yellow Derry boxes outside.",
          "We walked around downtown and came across this castle. It's not really too special, except that its big and detailed and of course that Royalty lives in the center of the city.....",
          "I guess tourists will always put this on the list, but it is a little disappointing. You can only walk past and at best take a photo. Lots of better places in town to spend time.",
          "Another must see place in Luxembourg is the Grand Ducal Palace at the centre of town. Get there early if you want to take pictures as it gets very crowded during the day.",
          "Nice to look at for a few minutes, get some photos, then move on to to more interesting scenic views.",
          "Well,nothing great about it but yes it makes you think that how can a duke live with such small security ,there was only one guard",
          "Worth a look if passing by - a photo opportunity. One guard at the main entrance, marching in front of palace occasionally. Not allowed inside.",
          "Wonderful international environment! Small and convenient. Nice atmosphere and many different choices for food and bars. Enjoy",
          "Kids liked to watch the marching guards. I studied the stone carved facade and balconies. We didn't go inside.",
          "when the grand-duke is here , and not in one of his other castles , you will see the luxembourg flag, and admire the soldiers",
          "could not go in and I don't think you ever can. An interesting building with a soldier standing outside. Don't make the effort unless you are in the next street",
          "Probably the most democratic palace in the world. The facade looks like just another house in the street. Love the concept of the monarch living in the middle of his people.",
          "The Palace is like a small but charming fairytale building. Charming like the city itself. But what is truly wonderful is the streetlight on the little square in front of the Palace. Come in the evening after dark and watch faces of light follow you around. Great fun and",
          "Easy accessable in the city-centre. Nothing special to see, as the building looks alot like the surrounding ones. Guard walks outside all the time.",
          "The story of the palace is intriguing and the place is nicely kept. The different architecture elements are nice.",
          "If you stroll around you will just walk up to the Palace. Used for official state function now and worth seeing for aphoto",
          "After living in Luxembourg a few years I visited the Duke's Palace and it worth it... in summer there is guided visits (very cheap or even free, I can't remember). It is nice if you are visiting the city",
          "This palace is close to Place Guillaume II square and other attractions. This building have such a great architectural structure.",
          "Inbetween other buildings there is located the palace. You can distinguish it by the two little houses for the guards and its slightly better decor but otherwise not grand. It might reflect the concept of a Luxembourgian culture. It is informative to see, just don't expect",
          "The Palais Grand-Ducal is so beautiful and grand. When I was there the Romanian president was visiting and I get to see the official ceremony which was so cool. I also got to talk to one of the Luxembourg\u2019s lady official/minister and she told me in Luxembourg they like to give",
          "Easy to find in the centre. Fun to watch the guard do his march back and forth. Unfortunately, facility was not open to the public.",
          "I lived in Luxembourg for 6 years and never once did I get an invitation to visit the palace. ;) It's beautiful and a great place to get a couple touristy photos. Sometimes they have a palace guard out front wearing his boots off marching to and fro.",
          "Lovely building in the heart of the Old Town. Unfortunately tours were not available whilst we were visiting but it is open to the public during the summer months.",
          "Our guide Michaela was excellent at explaining why the turrets were all different and why there were varying amounts of guards on different days. We could not go inside, but from the outside the ornate embellishments made it a worthy sight to see despite the temperature being",
          "There are soldiers here who perform their stylised parading outside. It interesting to note the different periods of construction which is reflected in the architecture.",
          "Reading the reviews, it appears to be closed most of the time, so it's a walk by, wave to the guards pacing back & forth, take a photo, and wonder why you bothered.",
          "This is definitely worth walking by which is all u can do for most of the winter. It however is a very pretty building and we'll worth walking by.",
          "How can you go to Luxembourg City and not see the Palace? Its amazing to see it in the middle of the city and experience the changing of the Guards. We were lucky enough to see an official car with one of the Royals leave the Palace. But don't miss having a hot chocolate in",
          "Not sure if you can go in on some days but not when we visited. It is nice to talk past. Great cafe outside you and sit and have a hot chocolate and see the view",
          "This is the official residence of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. The head of state of the Grand Duchy does most of his work here. There are honor guards in front (very impressive) and it is a beautiful building though hard to see with good perspective since its surrounded by",
          "A very nice building externally, although with the word \u2018palace\u2019 in it, a bit disappointing. And with no entry, although we obviously knew that, hardly a significant attraction.",
          "Beautiful castle for the Duke of Luxembourg. There was a military guard in front, indicating the Duke was inside. Being in the city for the Christmas Market we had no time for a guided visit. We will come back for sure in summer time. Luxembourg city centre is beautiful",
          "Pretty, even cozy, dolls' house. Perfectly situated in the center of the city of Luxembourg, it is a pretty spot, necessary in Luxembourg",
          "The palace of the gand dukes is such beauiful architecture although we did not go inside. would have loved to see interior",
          "Guided tours are offered during the summer while the great-ducal family is on holidays. It is the most emblematic building in the country and the guided tour helps you to better understand Luxemburgish history.",
          "It is the official working place of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. during the day, if you have 2 soldiers, than he is in the palace, if one, he is in the country and if none, he is outside the country.",
          "lights and building all decorated for christmas made worth the walk there. really nice, right across from the ice skating rink.",
          "Worth seeing, not a highlight. Does not take very long to take the tour. Experience probably depends almost entirely on the quality of the guide - ours was friendly and interesting.",
          "Poor soldier had to march up and down the front.Nice place to live and looks well wired and refurbished. Certainly no evidence that there are only three residents there! Much redevelopment in the city centre.",
          "Its no more than an ornate building with a guard marching in front of it. You cant go in, no public access or tours offered. Worthy of a picture as you are walking by.",
          "After a pretty rainy day, I had the opportunity to walk in the afternoon for a few hours in the old town of Luxembourg. It was cloudy and windy. Suddenly I saw the Palace of the Grand Duke located next to the Chamber of Deputies of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The palace was",
          "What an impressive place. A credit to the city of Luxembourg. The locals seem very proud and you can see why. Well worth a walk too. Just don't upset the guards!",
          "You can't go inside, so really all you're seeing is another cool building in Luxembourg. There's a guard outside that marches every once in a while, which is also cool, but I wouldn't go out of your way to go see this if it's not already in your path.",
          "Go have a look at the Grand Dukes palais and know right away whether the owner is in or away by noting the guards pacing in front of the door (or not). you might even get a glimpse of the Grand Duke or his family. And don't fail to notice the interesting lights across the palace",
          "Interesting building but no public access.we saw changing of the guard when the one soldier was replaced by another,probably significant part of the Luxembourg army.Well worth detour for excellent chocolate.house and bistro de la presse opposite.",
          "this is a nice building with guards outside and that is about it nothing else. the arquithecture of the building is nice but not much than that.",
          "If you are visiting Luxembourg, you should definetely visit it. It's a must for a every visitor and I strongly recommend it.",
          "The palace is a nice building adjoining the Luxembourg parliament. That's it. No information, no entrance, etc. Luxembourg is small so you will see it whether you try to or not, so don't make it part of your plan.",
          "I have been several times at the palace. Everytime, someone is visiting me, this is a mark on our map. Even though it is not possible to go inside, it is beautiful to take look at the building itself and the ornaments on the wall.",
          "Nothing really special as you only see the fa\u00e7ade of the building without being able to go in. There are a few black poles opposite the building where an artist has carved faces at the top where the eyes seem to follow you as you walk along. It symbolises guards keeping watch of",
          "It was a nice building Nice surrounding area.. However, cant go inside to see !! The area is very enought to enjoy walking as part of your day walk",
          "Looks nice from the outside, we got to walk around, but no where to get in. Just nice to see from the outside.",
          "We walked all around trying to get inside but we were unable to do so. I don't know why this would be something to visit if you can't get in and see it as the outside looks like so many other European buildings. I'd skip it and take the train somewhere else.",
          "We just walked around the front and side of the building and it is quite beautiful but it was not open to see on the inside. They two guard houses but there was only one there. Interesting to see while sightseeing but no need to go out of your way.",
          "There are so many sights to choose from and this is one of the sights you must visit. When you understand the history of Luxembourg and how it evolved over the centuries then the seat of power of this principality becomes very interesting. If you have a vivid imagination then",
          "Even though we were able to see it only from outside, it is such a lovely building,was so glad that we saw it.The shapes of the roofs, are like in a fairy tale castle in Disneyland. Well worth a visit. The outside is so very clean and very beautiful.",
          "The Duke's Grand Palace is open for visiting only in the summer months. So there are quite some people wanting to visit when it is the time. I recommend to buy tickets in advance, especially if you would like an English tour. As we got the last two places on the tour.We booked",
          "Unless you're lucky enough to be there when you can go inside, it's just nice to take a walk by. The palace is open briefly in the summer, and this year I was lucky enough to get inside. You can easily imagine the Royals entertaining here. The photo history at the beginning of",
          "We stumbled upon this tour when we visited the information office. It seemed the tour sells out quickly as they have set tours with set languages. The tour itself is 45mins. We have to queue at the start to get bags and coat checked. You cannot take photos inside the palace.",
          "Located in the middle of Luxembourg , where u can get acquainted with a lot of tourists visiting the palace and the district which is the main district for shopping , eating or even going for a quick beer .. The chocolate house by Nathalie Bonn facing the palace is a must visit",
          "In Summer there are visits of the inerior, there are guided visits for approximately 45 minutes; photos and videos is not allowed inside. 1418 it was the Town Hall., next century it was destructed, and recontructed, and 1992 -95 complete transformation of the palace; it has a",
          "Very nice place with a bite of history from charming guide most probably at the age of palace itself ;) It is possible to book a tour in different languages and spend an hour in Duke's residence which is worth spending of 10 euro. Mind a very narrow window when open to visitors",
          "Although there isn't really much to do it's a short walk from other city sites so I'd definitely say worth the walk to look at.",
          "You can purchase the tour tickets for tours in various languages, all sold at the tourist information office on Place Guillaume II. The English tour was guided by Rene, who truly adored the Grand Duke and the Grand Duchy's history. This is no Louvre but still interesting and",
          "The guide spent a lot of time telling us about the history of this monarchy. The palace was underwhelming as palaces go. The tour was saved by being short and sweet. Definitely not worth the 10 euro price.",
          "It is a building in the center of the city. I was hoping at least will have some nice dressed guards and I can take some pictures with them. But no guards and no dofferent building from the other ones",
          "My friend and I were disappointed that you can only go inside the castle with a guided tour that costs 10euro, we thought we had read differently online. Neither of us like tours so it just wasn't worth it for us. We took a few photos of the outside and kept going. It is",
          "Visits are possible in several languages. Tickets to be bought at the Tourist Office. Can be reserved online. Duration: 1 hour. Nice overview of Luxembourg history",
          "Duke of Luxembourg palace, you can probably have a tour inside, not really sure. Definitely a \"must\" in Luxemburg.",
          "While walking around in the city center, I came across this building and realized its the palace. Good architecture from the outside and even surrounding buildings are also impressive. But nothing more to do, you can see this and more important places that are in the city center",
          "Really pretty building. Great architecture. Unfortunately there were no tours on the day we choose to visit. Would love to come back and get a tour of the inside.",
          "Guided tour only, no fotos, costs 10 euros. Book in advance. Can only buy tickets in the tourist center a couple blocks away. We had to take a tour in German because English was all sold out. Groups of about 40 people. Inside is decorated very nice from 300 years ago to",
          "Not a kind of Royal Palace as I have used to see. The Palace kind of pop uo behind the corner. However Palace is always a Palace.",
          "\"Great but a shame had to see it from the outside.\" The title says it all. I heard that it's open only during a certain time of the year, though thats very understandable as it's the grand duke's place. But as a tourist that's always a bit disapoointing I guess :P",
          "Although it was closed this still is a must see for the visitor to Luxembourg. The old world architecture is impressive and there are many excellent shops and restaurants nearby. Don't miss!!",
          "Again part of our walking tour and our great guide gave us a great narrative about the palace and its' history.",
          "The building it's ok. Great place. I saw the small changing guard, but there's another changing guard happens just in july and August. In this period, you can also go into the palace that is not free entrace. It's not like england changing but it is nice. Reccomend you to go",
          "This was, in a way, quite funny to see. One soldier marches from left to right, without stopping. Made me wonder, what would happen if I would cross that rope. He'd probably just yell at me to stop. That's it. But I didn't do it. It's probably a main attraction there. The",
          "This palace is truly a tribute to the people of Luxembourg. It didn't seem that one could get inside, but from the outside it's simply magnificent.",
          "Nice building and the soldier in front of it walking up and down looks a kind of fancy. Worth to walk by and stop for a picture.",
          "This palace was built around the late 15th century. Love the architecture of this place. Great Spanish Renaissance style. Very impressive place for all those that are architecture fans.",
          "The Palace is easy to find in the old city and you can watch the guard for a while. Having a photo taken with the guard and the sentry box in the background seems to be a favourite passtime for many tourists.",
          "Unless you're into architecture you won't appreciate this building. There was a guard outside just like most palaces have.",
          "The Palace is very close to the upper town centre. It is very nice to find a Palace you can be so close to.",
          "There building is lovely, the metal door designed and the golden looking make it impressive whenever the sun decides to show up in Luxembourg. The place is nice, but I think that is not properly used so far to bring it to its full potential.",
          "you won't be flabbergasted to see this palace, as a palace it looks quite \"ordinary\" however, the location is pretty and the sculptures are nice",
          "As the family was in residence, could only view the outside. Pretty dull, all told - there are prettier buildings elsewhere in the city.",
          "It's a former palace and current administrative office for the Grand Duke... The changing of the guard is very lame. Can't be visited unless it's the summer when the Duke is on vacation.",
          "The Palace is not very large however the visit is worth the time and money. You will get to know a bit more about the Grandduke's family and the system in Luxembourg. The chateau quality of the Palace is also very nice.",
          "The palace is only open for a brief time during the summer when the Duke and family are away. Still interesting to see from the outside with the official guard on duty.",
          "Nice place, great view..especially during night with lighting! A part of the luxembourgish history to know.",
          "small beautiful Palace. You can take a photo in front of palace. If you see the flag on the top of the palace that mean the king stay here.",
          "This Palace is quite remarkable in the sense that it is situated in the middle of the city, close in proximity to other nearby buildings. Usually most palaces are situated away from other buildings with a bit of open space and room. However this is like \"right in the city",
          "Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy. Palace of the Grand Dukes (Palais Grand-Ducal), Situated right next door to the Luxembourg Parliament, is the official residence of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg and used for all official functions.",
          "Unfortunately we took a day trip and there was a strike at the same time. We got to see the apartment only which was disappointing but at least we got to see some statues and the secret garden.",
          "I thought it was an odd location for the Palace. It was very pretty from outside, and neat to watch the guard outside. It was June so it was crowded outside but still neat site!",
          "We could not get into the palace. From the outside it looks like a nice townhouse. As a palace it's not very impressive.",
          "The palace is set in an unusual location and we originally passed it and thought it to be a really beautiful building, it was later we discovered it was the palace - so it's set in an unusual location but is very picturesque!",
          "It is the official residence of Grand Duke of Luxembourg and as such has a historical and symbolic importance for his people. The palace was built in 16th century and has been renovated many times. Various items (e.g. artifacts, decorations etc) were allegedly lost or ruined",
          "there was a time that our dukes and duchesses slept thee, now, they come a few days a year , to receive , most foreign guests",
          "It was quite tricky to find, but it's good to say that you've seen it. I think I was a bit underwhelmed to be honest.",
          "Me and my family we enjoyed the visit, it in English and French , the tour guide is very nice old lady ,photos are not allowed inside ,it will give a very good idea about the country , the city and the royal family",
          "this is a lovely building in the heart of this small city, with a Ruritanian guard on view to the delight of tourists. everything in this small, compact but lovely city can be seen in a day",
          "It is a must to visit place in Luxembourg, but please do not have high expectations... The guard is nicely stands in front of the palace, but not to compare to other places, like London or Athens...",
          "Beautiful little palace/castle in the middle of this medieval city. Don't forget to tun around and also enter the \"chocolate house\", just in front of the palace (it's a must for chocolate lovers)",
          "Well nothing much to see here. A palace with a single guard holding fort outside. Also it was cramped between many other modern buildings",
          "just a regular building, nothing special about it. you can't go inside. the view from outside is not very special as well.",
          "The castle is in the city center located near a number of government buildings. I wouldn't say it's pretty and it seems to be packed in between a number of modern buildings",
          "Only looked from the outside but it's lovely. Located in the central area so you can't really miss it! The guard was patrolling outside. Recommend the 'House of Chocolate' across from it for nice hot chocolate and cakes!",
          "Go there at sunset in the summer, walk around, breathe history and enjoy the atmosphere. One of the jewels of Luxemburg",
          "I visited it several times but I like it most at evening when lights are on. It is kind of stamp for Luxembourg - small but nice. Kids liked the guards walking.",
          "It was neat to see the outside of the building since that's all we were able to see because the Duke's residence is available to be toured during a few weeks of the summer (not in February).",
          "should the grand duc be in, you can see the guards patrolling in front of the palace. but even in their absence, you can see his domicile from the outside and maybe have a hot chocolate in the chocolaterie just across",
          "It is a very beautiful palace, but when one thinks of a palace, usually assumes it is huge. Not the case here. My children were amazed by the soldier guarding its entrance.",
          "It is worth visiting it (outside) when taking a walking tour of the pedestrian area of the city. You can take pictures and, if you are lucky, you can see the Grand Duke.",
          "Small state and small head of state residence. But definitely worth seeing. One can almost see himself sitting behind the big windows looking down on ones kingdom. It is welcoming but it does not offer much things to do...",
          "Absolutely stunning building. The architecture is very impressive and the history of the building is also very interesting.",
          "This, quite impressive, building is located at the city center. It is mostly closed for the public, and like the Brits, they have a guard posted outside it. The Luxembourgish Grand Duke however is actually rarely here, so your chances of seeing some royalty are pretty much zero.",
          "Picturesque setting for amazing shots. Stand on Casemates dy Bock, on both sides one can see marvels of french/dutch architecture.",
          "If your thinking of a mini break that's dripped in history,beauty and panoramic views, then Luxembourg is the place for you.It has a calming effect that's contagious. It offers the sophistication of Italy for shopping with an added quaintness of boutiques. One of my favorite",
          "The building is ok. Not much to see. It is close to the center, so, easy to find and close to your way. Otherwise it is not worth visiting.",
          "We were on a guided tour of Luxemburg, and part of the tour was the Palace of the Grand Dukes. A very notable building it is too, it also has an ARMED army guard parading/marching up and down in front of the Palace (very smart as well). The guide informed us that the Grand Duke",
          "Nothing special. You just see the same things as in the photographs. There is a restaurant opposite to the palace, which is a must try.",
          "Is not every day open for public,so if you are lucky,go to see it!You have seen maybe other palaces much bigger and more beautiful but this is like Luxembourg: small and charming!Is a part of history still alive,sometimes Grand Duke is here!Can't take pictures,so be open eyes ..",
          "Historic, charming open court encircled by historically charming structures. The architecture alone is worth the visit, which we have many times.",
          "Well woth seeing when you are in town. Good for sightseeing and lots of shops nearby. Take your time and maybe a coffee to enjoy the view.",
          "Unless it's not the Grand-Dike's home (which is Castle Berg) it is the official residence of the world's last and unique Grand-Duke. Watch the flag, and the number of soldiers (1 for normal guard, 2 when the GD is in the house), nice to see as well the backdoor entry where in",
          "Nice building architecture stands out briefly went passed as was due to fly back some only briefly toured the city.",
          "Unfortunately not open to the public in winter, it is still very much worth viewing from the outside. Stunning building home to their Royal family that is guarded 24/7.",
          "Wonderful to drive through the city. If done on a Sunday you can avoid all traffic and see the infrastructure and architecture.",
          "This is not the most magnificent castle you will ever see but still make time to see it if you can as it is a fantastic building of its kind and the Grand Duke still uses it as his main office.",
          "The Palace is only open for the public during the summer months, so after some waiting was very eager to look how it is inside. Unfortunately is nothing special if you have been to similar structures in neighbouring countries. You get a sense of the history of the place, but",
          "Worthy of walking past and admiring, even if you are there when the guided tours of the inside are not available. It is not particularly large or imposing, but the architecture is lovely.",
          "We viewed the palace from outside while walking through central Luxembourg City. The building is beautiful & fits in with the charming old architecture of the city centre.",
          "Didn't get in, only saw it from the outside, impressive and looks in harmony with the surroundings. Right in the front of palace there is Chocolate House with nice chocolate spoons.",
          "In the summertime, during the administrative holiday the palace is open for tourists. It is important that tickets can only be purchased in the tourist information office at Place Guillaume II (10 euros for adults), and that there are only two English-speaking tours per day.",
          "We took a short 40 minute guided tour of the interior recently. It is essentially a small but grande official reception residence. The tour was limited to only a few rooms and we spend the first 20 mins of the tour in only one room learning the history of the family. The tour",
          "Luxembourg city is a small but beautiful, peaceful and a picturesque city. A small walk and you can see everything in half a day. Worth a visit to all free sites.",
          "Stunning architecture and rich history. Beautiful well-maintained grounds and lovely gardens. A must see while in Luxembourg City!",
          "Visites in the summer for tourists. must only tourist visit it;(45 minutes 5 euro) 1418 Town Hall first mention in the documents; 1554 Destruction cause by a terrible gunpowder explosion and 1573 reconstuction of the present palace. The Gran Duc et la Grande-Duchesse",
          "You get to see a few decorated rooms in what is just a public building, the Duke and his family live in a castle 25km away. The guide just spouted the history of the royal family. He told us of the connections with other royal families around the world which is obviously",
          "Beautiful building and a nice square, with lots of souvenir shops and cafes next to the palace but we didn't feel like going inside",
          "We chanced upon this at the Changing of the Guard which is not as lavish as London, or Stockholm but interesting nevertheless. It is close to the Tourist information centre",
          "Beautiful palace, nice to see a castle where someone actually lives there! They don't let you take pictures inside, but it's very beautiful. Make sure you plan your trip accordingly-they only let you in a few weeks a year!",
          "We visited the palace as part of a booked english tour - and had been looking forward to the visit for two years. It lasted 45 mins and was the most boring tour of a stately home imaginable. The guide was appalling. The displays were amateurish in the extreme. Questions were",
          "IF you walk around the old town it's small enough that you'll see everything there including the palace. Picturesque and worth a brief visit",
          "The Palace and the next door chamber of deputies are well worth finding. Unfortunately we did not have time for a tour and there were no guards on duty but it is a great photo op. Very interesting architecture style. Close to all the shops and cafes.",
          "The front gate shows a beautiful Luxembourg coat of arms that has a double-tailed lion before a background of silver and blue stripes. The Luxembourg flag takes the colors of the coat of arms that dates back to the 13th century with its three horizontal bars of red, white and",
          "Done the tour inside that lasted 45 minutes and even though it was good with nice artefacts and pictures to see it didn't really do much for me. But for little more than 10\u20ac you can't complain to much.",
          "For a tiny Duchy, impressive indeed, especially the golden spires. It is one of the smallest royal palaces I have seen in Europe but sure has character. It is a pity that it is not accessible to the public at all hours. Wanted to go inside but was not possible. Check in advance",
          "The Palace of the Grand Dukes is (rightly) located in the heart of Luxembourg City. You can literally walk right up to it. Unfortunately there must have been no one in the residence because we did not get to see the guards march, but it still did not disappoint.",
          "Beautiful palace, just next to parliament and the place Guillaume ii. Normally not open to visitors. There are guided tours in the summer though. It is worthwhile to wait for the changing of the guards.",
          "We enjoyed seeing the guard march back and forth in front of the palace. My daughter had the opportunity to tour the inside. If you are there in the summer while the royal family is away, there are tours of the inside.",
          "Worthwhile visiting. Well maintained and interesting to see within gard change. Located in the city of Luxembourg, between a 15 to 20' walk from central station.",
          "The architecture in the whole city is amazing! The palace is beautiful but I couldn't believe it was right in the middle of the shopping area. Not a lot to see but cool to walk by.",
          "The palace is very beautiful, and we arrived just at the right time as the Duke was leaving his palace in a black car, we saw him waving to us!! Although we couldn't really see his face clearly... The guard was nice and was marching up and down. It's a pity we can't visit inside",
          "The Palace of the Grand Dukes is (rightly) located in the heart of Luxembourg City. It is a building that one can get up close and have a good look at the wonderful architecture and adornments. It is a shorter stop that other sites in Luxembourg, but it is still worth the quick",
          "One of the closest-to-the-people royal palaces I've ever seen in Europe. It should be your first stop in the concentrated sight-seeing radius Luxembourg offers.",
          "Is it really a must in my city tour? Well, if you have available time it might be part of your plans, however you will not see anything really special here. The guards are the only attraction (when they are not only standing as a statue).",
          "Beautiful city! This Palace is huge,located in the middle of the city, right across from the Chocolate House. There is a Soldier pulling roving guard 24/7. Pretty to cool watch. We visited on a Sunday and it was quite a few ppl out and about that day.",
          "We saw this building whilst on an organised tour of the city at the end of our River Cruise. The Grand Duke of Luxembourg was in residence as the flag was flying. There was one guard outside marching up and down. He was very smartly dressed but eyed me with suspicion as I took",
          "This was the original residence for the Royal family, these days it is only used for formal receptions, an amazing piece of architecture situated in a square in the heart of town, sadly not open to tourists except in the month of August, check out the guards",
          "Centre of Lux City is so small, that you can't miss this if you are wandering around for awhile. We were lucky enough to be there were there were soldiers in their uniforms \"changing guards\" . Beautiful place, so worth of visit",
          "Not a must-see but it's a nice place in Luxembourg city; as it's very close to the golden lady or the cathedral it's hardly possible to miss it. you should also take a look into the old-school record store in front of the palace..",
          "The Palace is a very quaint building - lots of character. On the edge of a square near the heart of town. Occasionally see the \"Changing of the Guards\" - without the fanfare you find at Buckingham Palace! Definitely worth walking past.",
          "Look, you are in Luxembourg fora reason....to see the Grand Ducal Palace otherwise you are here for work......and still you will want to see it. It is nice and I'm sure of State occasions the centre of this amazing country.",
          "The appellation of Palace is a bit of an overstatement . It's an imposing mansion with uniformed guards and assorted family crests. Would not plan a separate trip to visit it but It's conveniently located between Norte dame and Place Guillame .",
          "looks very good,it was not open for visitors in february.guarded by guards.it is in the center of the town.",
          "The Duke's Grand Palace is open for visiting only in August, unfortunately we visited it back in October. Still the front looked impressive, especially the place guards which are a sight to behold",
          "This one actually has someone still living in it, unlike most we saw in Europe. Guarded by soldiers this was a neat sight to see.",
          "A beautiful building in the city easy to stumble across although only the front is visible from the large square. There are a few coffee and hot chocolate caf\u00e9s opposite and is a nice place to sit to soak up the Palais Grand Ducal on a warm sunny day, although when we visited",
          "More like a large posh town pad rather than a what you would think of as a palace? Still, good tourist draw with the armed army guard ( not guards, due to cut-backs!) marching up and down outside the front door, all day!",
          "Always read about Luxembourg so when we had a chance I jumped at the offer to take a train ride from Brussels to Luxembourg. Once off the train we walked across a long high bridge to one of the cleanest cities I have ever been. The palace was glorious with it's one guard. It",
          "As we visited in December, the palace was not open to visitors. The only way the palace is recognisable is by the armed soldier standing guard outside. It is also worth a look at the back entrance as it has a lovely gate.",
          "Tucked into the edge of town you could overlook this as just another pretty building but the soldier matching up and down outside alert you to its grandeur. Looking up it almost seems like a Disney mock-up until you realise that this is a real fairy-tale palace.",
          "But the eleven months of the year all one can do is stand on the pedestrian mall in front and look at a beautiful building. But it's just as beautiful as thsands of others in Europe. Fortunately, it's found on almost any random stroll arnd Haute Ville so it's not as if there",
          "The Duke's Grand Palace is open for visiting only in August. So there are quite some people wanting to visit when it is the time. I recommend to buy tickets possibly a few days in advance, especially if you would like an English tour. They can be purchased at the Luxembourg",
          "The Grand Palace is only open to tourists during the month of August. Tickets need to purchased in advance at the City Tourist Office ( 30 Place Guillaume II) at which time you choose the language of your tour. We have done the English tour twice with guests. There is a",
          "But still worth visiting and listening to interesting stories hidden behind the courtains and pictures",
          "A simple Royal palace but so very beautiful One solider need to walk all the time but the solider will have 2 if the king is in the palace",
          "45 minute tour of some of the interior rooms in the Palace. Book a week in advance for the English version. Our guide knew a lot about the Royal family and their significance during important historical battles as well as which pieces in the home were acquired from important",
          "I love this city to be honest. Everything about it. I love the Palace being right kurplunk in the middle of it. The lights with the faces that follow you as you pass. The guard, pounding the ground back in forth in front. I am out and about a lot in Luxembourg. I have heard",
          "The building was nice and you can watch the guards pacing up and down and we were lucky enough to see the guards charge. The best part was watching the Chinese tourists trying to get their photos with the moving guard",
          "Located in the heart of Luxembourg city. NIce architecture, I liked changing of the guard outside the palace.",
          "We went on the guided tour of the Grand Duke's Palace (in English). The tour guide was very knowledgeable about the history of the Grand Dukes of Luxembourg. we found it very informative. It is worth booking this in advance, which can be done by email (to the Luxembour City",
          "The whole family went for guided tour one rainy afternoon. The tour guide is a senior man but was very entertaining. He explained in a very detailed manner every information we need to know about each room. I didnt enjoyed it much because I continued to run after my little",
          "We were lucky to travel to Luxembourg on the final weekend of the summer visit season to the palace. The tour was fantastic. The guide took you through the palace and introduced in great detail room by room the significance of the various items as well as the history of the",
          "The tours are only available for about 6 weeks during the summer when the palace is not used for functions etc, The Grand Duke and his family do not actually live at the Palace, but use it for receptions, functions. The history behind the palace is interesting and there are",

          "We took a German tour as the English one was full (warning: pre-book your tour!) and although we didn't understand much of the guided tour, we enjoyed looking at the beautiful interiors of the palace. They have been tastefully kept up to date with modern trends and standards.",
          "We did not go inside the Palace, but from the outside it is gorgeous, with lovely architectural details, and is right in the center of the city, not far from the statue of Guillaume II on his horse. I love the detail of the Luxembourg crest on the gates. I understand this is",

          "Being used to the pomp and ceremony of London the palace of the Grand Duke is charmingly understated, almost tucked away round a corner, with just one soldier keeping guard. You can do a tour inside but as part of a city walking tour just seeing the outside is great. Good",
          "I prefer to be able to explore historical buildings at my own pace, but here you can only visit it as part of a guided tour. Our guide offered a wealth of information on the building and the history of the royal family of Luxembourg, but being talked at for 45 minutes was a",
          "Luxembourg city has only so many attractions, and the Ducal palace is one of them. The only way to visit is to take a guided tour, which is available in many languages and at various times a day - all are posted at the entrance of the palace and at the tourism bureau just a bit",
          "Once you come upon this intimate square, you will notice a serious uniformed guard marching up and down. He's certainly surrounded by tourists taking photos. Then, if you look further on, you may notice a couple at the top of the steps. \"The royal couple!\", I heard someone say.",

          "It is the official resident of the grand duke and we were there in October and the guards were parading outside. I think you can only tour in July and August so we missed out. Wonderful though to stand outstide and admire the architecture of this beautful building.",
          "Just saw it from the outside. It was a lovely building. Very interesting architecture. For sure worth a visit even if you didn't go inside.",
          "One of the great monuments in Luxembourg. Must see attraction when you visit this little country in Europe.",
          "All the tourist books and info from the tourist office and the hotels lists the times open to visit the palace as being from July to the 2nd week of September. This is incorrect the palace closes to visitors on August 31st. So we wasted time on our vacation trying to visit",
          "The palace can only be visited during a couple of weeks in summer, but it's definitely worth the visit. The palace is really not big, but the guides will show you the main rooms and have you travel through a couple of centuries of history, based on the guide you go with, you",
          "In the centre of town a large semi ornate building I would hardly call it a palace from the outside nor would I go out of my way to get here but still if you are in the vicinity and are passing by it will make a nice photo of an easily forgettable building",
          "If you want to know more about Luxembourg's history and its royal family this is the place to be ! A 45 minute guided tour that will resume centuaries of ruling.",
          "The building itself is absolutely stunning, the interiors very well kept. However the ticket seller at the tourist office didn't mention that the tour was in German, so I spent the hour-long tour not really fully appreciating the intricacies of the Palais.",
          "As the duke and duchess do not spend the summer months in Luxembourg,the palace is open to the public for visits. Part of the palace dates from the Renaissance a period of the 16 th century. Another part is from the Napoleonic period and part is the congres of Luxembourg.",
          "Since 1890, the Grand-Ducal Palace is the town residence of the Grand Duke. The building is one of the most beautiful architecture in town and it was first the city hall of Luxembourg until the year 1795. The style is from Renaissance. It can be visited during summer month and",
          "Just saw it from the outside - lovely building. Very interesting architecture. Worth a look. Close to William II Square, so not too far out of the way.",

          "Beautiful building, nothing special, didn't get to see the interior but I believe it worths a visit while in Luxembourg city. Mostly enjoyed the walk around the castle and the perfect chocolate across the street at the chocolate house.",
          "The palace of the Grand Duke is fairly easy to miss as it does not look particularly royal. Nevertheless there are some guards in front of it from time to time, although they were not there when we passed by. Our guidebook had quite some info on the Grand Ducal family. Did you",
          "It was lovely while in the town square to be able to just look at the palace, a very pretty building, on a lovely street.",
          "This palace partially constructed in the 16C and amplified in the following two centuries has a very nice front, good for a quick visit. Being Luxembourg City a small place, it definitely worth a visit. Please, note the nicely decorated iron coat of armes over the entrance on",
          "Fantastic architecture in the heart of the city. Take a guide or find some information yourself before visiting, because the stories we heared about the royal family and palace itself were really interesting. :-)",
          "This is a residence of the Duke. It is nothing compared to the style of the many other palaces of Europe. You cannot enter. The only thing that is of interest is the guard out front. Stop by and take a quick picture but I promise you it will not be in the highlight reel",
          "Of the European \"royal\" palace, this building is among the smallest and, located in the very center of the old town, itslef built as a fortress, does not enjoy a large palace-square. this implies that, however you look at it, you always have sort of a \"macro\" perspective. Good",
          "Honestly the only cool thing about this is the armed guard outside marching back and forth. It is a nice looking building but truthfully there are nice looking buildings everywhere, this one happens to have a guard in front. I am sure it is packed with history and cool stuff",
          "The bad news: During most times of year, you can't tour this building. (You lucky folks who get in during the 15 July - 31 August tour season need to tell the rest of us what you saw!) The good news: You can't miss it when you're wandering though Luxembourg \u2014 and you shouldn't.",
          "I don't understand how this attraction can be rated so highly when you can only review from the outside! I have been told tours are available but I could not track them down. But anyway - nice facade and the guard on duty does do a march -both worthy of a quick view.",
          "Opposite the Chocolate House - also worth a visit. Only takes a few minutes to walk around and has a very central location.",
          "If you are taking a day to just meander around the city, this should be on the itinerary for something to see. the architecture is very pretty, and it's a cool building to see. Outside of that, there's not much to it. You cannot enter the building, so walking around the",

          "The palace has some nice architectural features but is quite modest. The lovely Chocolate House cafe is across from the palace and there are nice cobbled streets to walk around in the area.",
          "Not much to see. An ornate building, closed to the public, with a single guard marching back and forth. Next attraction!",
          "There is a guard, but it is nice to have a grand duke in the city. I even got the pleasure of seeing him in his police escort.",
          "They knew how to live in the old days. A very well constructed building in the heart of the city, it dominates its surroundings.",
          "Interesting to see once. You can get a tour with some of the history, it used to be a townhall and most marble etc are imitations. Only valuable items on display are some Russian vases, and French carpets given by France as Napolean or one of his officers were a bit dismayed by",
          "I am new in town, living in Luxembourg for one year and all can say is that \"masks\" on the top of the columns that are in front of the Palace, are simply amazing! The watch you along your way!!!",
          "If you have bought the Luxembourg tourist card, be sure to join the city tour for free. The palace is actually built within 3 time scales where significant differences can be seen clearly. Pity the army that need to march in front of the palace back and forth for no reason.",
          "This Palace is actually a place where the Grand Duke has his office and works from there..maybe if you are luck, you can get glimpse of him .",
          "After careful consideration and a lot of research via the web, we were totally disappointed on this trip. The palace web site did say that it was open to the public on the dates that we chose to visit. After 4hours of train journey which made it worst as one of the Belgium train",
          "I can say that this was the highlight of our trip to Luxembourg City. We had a wonderful tour guide. We had reserved our tour in English ahead of time. One issue with the English tour is that most other nationalities also sign up for the English tour, thinking that they will",
          "We attended the tour of the Palais Grand-Ducal today and were left fairly disappointed by the experience. Yesterday, it was strongly suggested to us by the tourist office that tickets sell out quickly so we should pre-purchase, as we did. They offer only 2 English tours per",

          "We had a chance to visit the Palace the last day of the trip. it was very outstanding as you see a lithe bit of the inner life of the Grand Duke's and get a certain historical overview of Luxembourg itself. We had the English Guide who was truly very dedicated and put",

          "Well, one of the Grand Dukes places! This one is in the City and easy to get too - it was recently renovated and cleaned - worthy of a quick look and some nice photos - look at the golden masks on the poles opposite the Palace - they are convex - but when you stand directly in",

          "You can visit the palace during August. All visits are guided. The tickets are sold in the Tourist Office only. It is a very modest, no frill palace, a part of which was used as a pub during WWII:",

          "If you are in Luxemburg, you have to see the palace, as it is an important part of the history. The visits are on some weeks in summer, times and dates are posted in front of the palace, you can get the tickets at the tourist information, that is only 5 minutes away. Luxemburg",

          "The palace is a working building. To get a tour in the language of your choice, book at the Tourist Information office - our guide told us the money goes to charity. Group sizes are restricted to about 30 which is understandable when you get in the rooms. An internal lift",
          "You aren't able to enter on your own, you might need to have a reservation or a tour set up. From the outside, it almost looks like a large upscale apartment. Photos of the interior look very nice but from the outside it isn't very impressive.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Adolphe Bridge (Luxembourgish: Adolphe-Br\u00e9ck, French: Pont Adolphe, German: Adolphe-Br\u00fccke) is a double-decked arch bridge in Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg.  The bridge provides a one-way route for road traffic across the P\u00e9trusse, from Boulevard Royal, in Ville Haute, to Avenue de la Libert\u00e9, in Gare.  Its upper deck is 153 m in length and carries two lanes of road traffic, and two pedestrian footpaths. Its lower deck, opened in 2018, suspended beneath the upper deck, is 154 m in length, and carries a dedicated bidirectional bicycle path, with access provided for pedestrian use. Following the completion of the third phase of the construction of the City Tram Line 1, expected in 2020, the bridge will carry bidirectional tram traffic on its upper deck.The Adolphe Bridge has become an unofficial national symbol of sorts, representing Luxembourg's independence, and has become one of Luxembourg City's main tourist attractions. The bridge was designed by Paul S\u00e9journ\u00e9, a Frenchman, and Albert Rodange, a Luxembourger, and was built between 1900 and 1903.  Its design was copied in the construction of Walnut Lane Bridge in Philadelphia, the United States.The bridge was named after Grand Duke Adolphe, who reigned Luxembourg from 1890 until 1905, and was the first monarch to hold the title not in personal union with another.  Although it is now over 100 years old, it is also known as the New Bridge (Luxembourgish: Nei Br\u00e9ck, French: Nouveau pont, German: Neue Br\u00fccke) by people from Luxembourg City.  The 'old bridge' in this comparison is the Passerelle, which was built between 1859 and 1861.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nWith the demolition of the city's famous fortification, under the 1867 Treaty of London, and the decline of its strategic importance, Luxembourg City reverted to the normality enjoyed by other cities.  The city's built-up area spread southwards from Haute Ville, over the P\u00e9trusse, where Luxembourg City's railway station was already located.  However, the only existing link to the south bank of the P\u00e9trusse was the old viaduct, which (at 5.50 m wide) was too narrow to accommodate all the traffic that would be expected between two halves of the city.In 1896, the government hired Albert Rodange to draw up plans for a new bridge.  Rodange identified the future bridge's position, connecting with the main axis of Boulevard Royal, and drew up initial plans for a large stone viaduct.  However, as Rodange lacked experience in bridge building, the government invited a foreigner with specific expertise in the field to help design the bridge.  Paul S\u00e9journ\u00e9, a Frenchman with years of experience designing similar viaducts in southern France, was chosen.\n\n\n=== Design ===\nAlthough S\u00e9journ\u00e9 concurred with Rodange's site and basic design, he made many major modifications.  Instead of several medium-sized arches, S\u00e9journ\u00e9 sought to build the bridge around a large central arch, flanked by smaller arches.  The plan, which was adopted, called for:\n\nTwin parallel 84.65 m arches in the centre, surmounted by eight smaller arches of 5.40 m each.\nTwo arches of 21.60 m flanking the central arch.\nTwo further arches of 6.00 m outside the medium-sized arches.In total, the bridge would have a length of 153 m.  The plans were audacious for that day and age; at 84.65 m, the central span was to be the largest stone arch in existence.  The roadway was constructed of reinforced concrete, a material that had only recently come into use, the weight of which was carried on the columns of the smaller arches, thereby saving the heavy infilling used in a conventional arched bridge.  The arches and columns were constructed from sandstone, quarried locally at Ernzen, Dillingen, Gilsdorf, and Verlorenkost. This design was later replicated by S\u00e9journ\u00e9 in a bridge over the River Garonne at Toulon and was copied in concrete for the Walnut Lane Bridge in Philadelphia.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nThe foundation stone of the bridge was laid on the 14 July 1900, and it was inaugurated just over three years later, on 24 July 1903. Originally, the bridge carried both road and rail traffic; two rail/tram tracks over the bridge formed part of the railway route from Luxembourg City to Echternach, which was opened on 20 April 1904.\n\n\n=== Renovations (1903-2003) ===\nIn its century of operations between 1903 and 2003, the bridge faced four periods of renovation. Minor changes were made in 1961 and 1976, including the removal of rail lines following the end of the first generation of trams in Luxembourg.  In 1990, the Luxembourgish government launched an investigation into the state of the bridge and found that it showed signs of extensive damage, to both the stonework and steel.  Between September 2003 and August 2004, the central arches were strengthened by the addition of 258 prestressed steel bars, with a total force of 25,600 tonnes (251 MN).\n\n\n=== Conversion to a double-decked bridge ===\nIn concordance with the reintroduction of trams in Luxembourg, major redesign and renovation work occurred between 2014 and 2017, with a temporary bridge constructed parallel operating in the interim. The Adolphe Bridge was widened and reinforced to accommodate the new tramlines installed on its upper-deck. Additionally, a 154 m long and 4 m wide lower deck was suspended beneath the existing deck, between the arches of the bridge, to act as dedicated bidirectional bicycle path and footpath. Bicycle-friendly sloped approaches were dug on the western side of both ends of the bridge, and an additional stairwell was added on the eastern side of the Ville Haute approach.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of rail transport in Luxembourg\nTrezzo Bridge\nConstruction photo gallery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdolphe Bridge at Structurae\nPhoto slide show of Pont Adolphe",

        "wiki": "Place Guillaume II is a town square in Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg.  The square lies to the west of Krautmaart and to the north of Boulevard Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the heart of Luxembourg's historic Ville Haute quarter.  It is colloquially known as Knuedler, from the Luxembourgish language's word for 'knot', referring to the knot in the belt worn by Franciscan friars.The western half of the square is dominated by Luxembourg City Hall in the southwest, whilst the equestrian statue to former Grand Duke William II, after whom the square is named, is the prominent feature of the eastern half.  Much of the square is ringed with trees, narrowing the open area (particularly around the statue).\nThe square was originally the site of a Franciscan monastery, hence the colloquial name.  However, in 1797, during the French Revolutionary Wars, the monastery was dispossessed by occupying French soldiers.  In 1804, the visiting Napoleon presented Place Guillaume II to the city as a gift.  In 1829, plans were put in place to build a new town hall on the square, based upon the plans of Belgian architect Justin Remont.  That same year, the deconstruction of the former monastery was completed, the material from which was used in the new building.The town hall was completed in 1838, and first used by the city council, chaired by long-time Mayor Fran\u00e7ois Scheffer.  However, due to the ongoing Belgian Revolution, the official unveiling could not be held at the time.  Instead, the town hall was officially unveiled on 15 July 1844 by Grand Duke William II, as was the statue in his likeness in Place Guillaume II.Place Guillaume II is used as an open air music venue, hosting the Rock um Knuedler rock concert each year since 1991.  The Rock um Kneudler concerts are free to the public, and have been watched by audiences of up to 10,000.  Since 1995, the concerts have been headlined by international acts, with the South African Johnny Clegg and the Italian Gianna Nannini topping the bill for the 2007 concert.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Place Guillaume II at Wikimedia Commons",

          "I like to visit and purchase local produce. It is historically important, of course, but the gem is to buy veggies, cheese, and charcuterie from the producers of the region. Adorable place to enjoy a pretzel or a cone, look around, and do your shoppings.",
          "As a Dutch citizen you are surprised to see Willem II on a square in an other city. Pity indeed that you need to find the historical story behind it on the internet and you don\u2019t find it back at the foot of the statue. The square is nice. You find the touristic office of",

          "There are a few squares and there\u2019s nothing like the city center but this is also a decent place to grab a bite and drink. We were here in June and it was packed but that\u2019s a good sigh of the vitality of the place right? It wasn\u2019t horribly crowded like Paris but it was full and",
          "Place Guillaume is perfect to have a walk around or to visit one of the many restaurants and caf\u00e9s that surround the square. There is also a small stage where various artists or groups usually perform.",
          "A square in the city centre which is a great melting pot of people, restaurants, music and many more. We spent a lot of time here and most will come for other reasons other than to look at the statue.",

          "Again a normal European statue in the middle of the city. Nothing exceptional about it. It was not prominent due to lots of constructions around",
          "Much excitement for the first weekend of Spring. Lots of community activities and quality eateries. The cultural Centre of the city",
          "This is the place to visit on any Wednesday or Saturday morning when the market is set up. Certainly it is an attractive square on any day of the week but when the market stalls are there it is really amazing. What stands out is the care and attention that the market stall",
          "There are a few nice cafes and shops on one side, but on a daily basis, not much going on. The space is used for the Saturday fresh food market.",
          "...so maybe not the best moment to visit. Still, a lot of shops around, local products and local food. And very difficult to miss, as it is literally the centre of the old town. THE iconic equestrian statue for Luxembourg City.",

          "Under major renovation so not good for photos but still worth visiting. I visited the William Square at Saturday market time; there were stalls with fresh vegetables and flowers, cheese and baked cakes. The square is named after William II, King of the Netherlands & Grand Duke",
          "This is the logical place to start one\u2019s visit to all the major landmarks of Luxembourg. At one end, there is the tourist office to get an orientation, map, directions. The cathedral is to the right and straight ahead beyond the statue of Willem or Guillaume, the streets to get",
          "Visited it in November 2017 and the Square was under heavy construction works, so that even the statue could only be seen by half. Not good for pictures but still there was a local market on Saturday morning.",

          "Building works are currently covering a decent chunk of the square including surrounding the handsome equestrian statue. When we were there on Saturday the only useful aspect was a local market for local people - fruit and veg etc. Perhaps only waste your time checking it out if",
          "Another very small square, by European standards. Perhaps it will be a better place to visit when the renovations are completed.",
          "Everyone winds up in Place d'Armes, so look for a restaurant called Veneziano. There is a walkway thru the restaurant and once on the other side you will be in Place Guillaume. Here you will find a few restaurants with outside seating, the tourist information center (this is",
          "It was OK - the statue was blocked by construction barriers, so once the construction is complete, I am sure this square will be better than when we were there.",
          "Even though the tourist information center was here it seemed like it was more of a relaxed area with cafes. Much calmer than the Place d'arms.",
          "Nice statue but under construction last summer. I would recommend checking with tourism office before heading there...",
          "The square in itself is nothing really to see, especially now with a lot of construction going on. However, there is plenty of action that is worth having a look at. Saturday and wednesday there is a farmers market where you can get vegetables, flowers and other things to eat",
          "This bronze statue was set up on William Square to pay tribute to the King and Grand Duke William II of Nassau-Orange. One year before his death, granted the Grand Duchy its first parliamentary constitution, one of the most liberal in Europe at the time. It is worth for a quick",

          "If you're in Luxembour this is an area you can't miss. The place is in the centre of the city of Luxembourg, which combines old and new buildings everywhere. Lovely place to sit at a cafe for a while.",
          "Another stop on the walking tour. This is certainly the way to learn a little of the history of Luxembourg",
          "Food was really good and the location is great. The tables are quite close to each other but I did not mind that at all. The only one thing I would say is that is there is quite a long wait between courses but I would be willing to wait as the food was very good.",
          "Besides the market on saturdays, and the tourist-office there is nothing much to see, as it is a constructionsite at the moment. A few good restaurants are located here.",
          "Not much to see here. Only the touristinformationcenter is the reason to vist this square at the moment.",
          "The square is at its best on Saturdays when there is an open market there - it is quite nice to see the difference between the sober square on Friday evening and the flowering patches and the stalls vending fruits, vegetables, meat and cheese the next morning. Some nice bars",
          "I visited this place in the morning so it wasn\u2019t crowded. I stopped by at the tourist info and they were very helpful. There is nothing else to do here except take pictures of the Luxembourg City Hall.",
          "This is the center of Luxembourg. Within this Place, you could see a number of attractions such as Hotel de Ville and statue of Konig Willem II. Other major attractions are within walking distance outskirt of this center.",

          "We celebrates New Year's Eve there. The atmosphere was happy and welcoming and everyone seemed to have fun. In the little stalls one could buy different kinds of food (e.g. sausages, cr\u00eapes) and hot as well as alcoholic beverages. I personally recommend the \"Choky with",
          "Very pretty here despite the main statue being under remodel. There was a Christmas market set up with ice skating and stands for food and mulled wine. This a lovely town. The statue is really gorgeous. Worth seeing. Grand Palace is nearby.",
          "A nice square, perhaps not too impressive in the summer but with the Christmas market there it was very pretty. Trees all dressed in lights, a large lit ice rink and a few stalls selling the usual mettwurst and hot gluhwein.",
          "We passed the square during our city visit and saw the Guillaume II statue. Because there are major construction works ongoing we could not really appreciate this square. We are convinced this will become part of the beautiful, well maintained and very clean centre of the city",
          "The square offers a market on Saturdays with great selection of fruits, vegetables, cheeses and meats. Restaurants are within walking distance and quant hotels line the square. Visitor center also on the square.",
          "This public place feels like the heart of Luxembourg. From this center, one can walk in any direction to experience the pleasures of the city. The visitors' center is right on this square as are ideal restaurants and the Hotel Vauban. There are market days and community",
          "This is the square where the Christmas market is but other than that, there is nothing else. If you are simply passing by, fine, if not, do not change your way.",

          "Unfortunately the square is undergoing some construction or restoration so a large part of it is boarded off at the moment. You cannot even properly see the statue of Guillaume II that the square is named for. Such a shame. There was a great organic produce market here at the",
          "As mentioned in a previous review - Pizza Hut - Place Guillaume plays host to a large variety of restaurants, from fast food (MCquick), through Chi-Chi's and Pizza Hut, to more haute cuisine affairs. The architecture is wonderful, and from the square hub (is that an oxymoron)",
          "This is could be consider as heart of Luxembourg.. Nice surrounding areas with good options for dining .. Great architecture and beautiful buildings.. Tourist information Centre is available here.. Enjoy your walk in this beautiful city",
          "This is the City Centre and a charming one at that. Good eating places and a vibrant shopping area make it even more attractive.",
          "Apart from a statue there is nothing but concrete and a construction site. The tourist office is here and is probably the only reason we were there.",
          "This centre is full of activity and most of it is free. You are lucky if you are there when some activity like a Musical, Flower or Art show is taking place. Full of cafes & shops. It is part of the old city tour.",
          "the whole year long, the city tourist office is organizng special events , even in december an ice skating ring, and in the summer a lot of concerts , free of charge , even classical music",
          "This statue is very big and very impressive.You can walk all around it and it is a must that you have your photo taken in front. Well worth the look.",
          "Unfortunately, the square was under construction when we visited, not allowing a good full sight of the square. However, it is impressive in size. We were able to get a good look at the statue though, which looks very well-maintained. The city hall side with the lions is also an",
          "The place is the major \"venue\" for free events in Luxembourg including concerts, art expositions and others... Everything that happens in the centre happens here..",
          "This is the most picturesque square in the historic center. Plenty of cafes and shops and the main tourist information office is along the perimeter here. Don't miss strolling this square while in town.",
          "Not only just a square, but a bit more than that depending of course on when you visit. It is the start of the Luxemborg City Walking Tours at the front of the Tourist office and there is underground parking underneath the square. The City Hall is on the square and there are",
          "There is nothing really impressive about this City Square which houses buildings such as the City Hall and Tourist Info Center.",

          "I guess this square in the center of Luxembourg City might look much better during Summer Time with some events, local sellers, better weather and lots of people passing by. Nevertheless, when we visited it nothing from the aforementioned was happening. Few people, depressing",

          "If you go to Place d'Armes, you might forget that Place Guilaume II is just next to it. In this square, you see the City Hall, the Tourist Information Office, some caf\u00e9s, trees with benches, the Saturday morning fresh food market. During Christmas season, there is a Christmas",

          "This magnificent statue dominates the square and, indeed, the whole surrounding area. It glorifies the whole Grand Dukedom of Luxembourg, with this portrayal of one of its most illustrious Dukes. This is how to show how good you are! I love it!",
          "Nice place to relax after a busy day, of course in summer time; some benches allow to sit and enjoy feel the sense of the history emanating from the ancient buildings around you",
          "On a Sunday, when we visited, this monument was surrounded by a flea market. Its just about 100 meters from the Palace of Grand Dukes.",
          "You get a sense of history in this square that is most unusual. The authorities have tried their best to bring it to life but I think a bit more could be done. English if definitely the third language here which is a shame since the day we visited the square was swamped by",

          "Lovely place. fresh fruit market- prices twice Germany. from here you can walk to different fashion shops.",
          "Named after Luxembourg's Grand Duke William II, this is the largest Square in the City. From reading other reviews I know that the Square is used for weekly markets and seasonal events but, during my stay, there wasn't anything happening apart from ongoing restorations, which",

          "There's a fine line between a charming old European city square lined with shops and cafes and a charming old European city square almost totally hidden by merchants and vendors hawking just about every product imaginable. Place Guillaume II has managed to cross that fine line.",
          "We were there in the morning while all the market stall were still there. It is a good place to buy local produce like cheese. We went later the afternoon and bough food at the stalls and spent the rest of the evening on the benches watching the people stroll by.",

          "Absolutely beautiful place so picturesque and views from all angles. Definitely worth a stop while you\u2019re here",
          "works in progress , it is a chaos , to pass this bridge , with a car , walking , or even cycling , so avoid this bridge",
          "It wasn\u2019t too busy in this part of the city and has many interesting old buildings. When we were there the restoration work was happening on the old fortifications.",
          "As a consequence of Luxembourg city's geographic location on a series of plateau between deep gorges, the architecture is dominated by a number of very high, architecturally beautiful bridges, this being just one. Both road and rail transport relies heavily on these engineering",
          "I wasn't expecting something extraordinary when I decided to go there but when I reached it was actually a pretty amazing view. I would recommend for those visiting Luxembourg. You have the casemates just next to it and the Petrusse Express.",
          "Similar to the Adolphe bridge but maybe less known is the Viaduc(Passerelle) bridge - built in the same period after Luxembourg became an open city and the fortress got \"dismantled\" in 1867 - so the bridges to connect the various parts of the city got built after that time. Now",
          "This is a very photogenically curved structure that dominates the centre of the old town. Whether you're near it, looking across at it or looking up at it, it's very impressive! It can be seen from quite a few areas but each time we have visited it's been cloudy so I'm not sure",
          "Accessible and within minutes walk from the old downtown area, offers a stunning view of the old and new town. Great to walk around here also!",
          "A walk in this old bridge you can have beautiful view of the old city.You need more than an hour to do a relaxing walk and enjoy the scenery.",
          "There are lovely views of the viaduct from near the Boch Casement entrance (and also from various 'windows' in the casements. It's well worth walking down into the viaduct and along by the water as there are then some great views back up, including to the double tier bridge.",
          "Great views - very windy so watch hats and umbrellas. You will walk over on way to old town area. Photo opportunity.",
          "Amazing view from the top of the gorge. Nice walk round the wall and steps down to the lower village. Steeped in history.",
          "Great place to walk and get some photo's. Go on a clear day for the best photo. Right near Bock Casements, and can do them in 1 day.",
          "The Passarelle and surrounding buildings and historical scenery are stunning. There are plenty of places to take panoramic and landscape photographs, as well as unique architectural features that make the area an enchanting walk. This was one of my favorite locations during my",
          "This a bridge made from stone as a continuous arches and span the Petrusse Valley below. The Viaduc is used for railway, and not for road. Therefore public cannot walk on this viaduc. However with its stunning shape, this viaduc is a really attractive photo graphical object. A",
          "Viaduc (Passerelle) at the Plateau du St.Esprit is nice location to view the old town and the river below. Photo-lovers will definitely ranked this spot on the high side.",
          "worthwhile standing in this point and see the view from the old town and river. During a sunny day the views are much better",
          "I have always had a liking for viaducts, but what makes this one extra special for me is the beautiful lush surroundings amidst where it stands. The Passerelle, also known as the Luxembourg Viaduct, or the Old Bridge, was built between 1859 and 1861. It runs from the south into",
          "I absolutely loved our time in Luxembourg and it was great to spend time strolling around the city, which is marvellous. The Passerelle is a nice place to visit because gives you full sight of the old town and you can take great photos.",
          "We walked down the steps from the Monument and found ourselves in a peaceful, quiet and gorgeous sea of green. We walked along until we reached the the underside of the Aldophe Bridge before heading back. If we had more time I think I could have walked forever in this serene",
          "The viaduct adds to the charm of the view both from Grund and the top part of Casemate du Bock and Plaffenthal lift.",
          "it is a good place to visit when you are walking around Luxembourg. It is not far from the city center and you can take good pictures",
          "More a means of getting from one side to the other as walking across it is difficult to really get to grips with its scale. It is better walking alongside the river and looking up to fully appreciate its size. A good view if flying in is from the aircraft just before it lands.",
          "Worth to see, beautiful nature. Great atmosphere. Hope to come back. Reccomended for everyone to see.",
          "Built in the mid 1800's and known as the \"Old Bridge\", the viaduct connects the city centre and the train station. Apparently, it was built away from the city's fortress so as not to provide easy access to potential invaders. Today, it looks like most other viaducts and you'll",
          "This is such a nice walk in Luxembourg where you can view the old buildings and the canal (?)/river. Worth the time!",
          "One gets a complete comprehension of the city by walking this path. The day I picked was beautiful, very picturesque to see how they have efficiently built this city in a small space",
          "For walkers and photo buffs this is a must - the views are simply amazing. It also helps to orient oneself so that you can choose which direction to explore later.",
          "Superb view, great walk. Worth spending some time to chill and take pictures. It is an uphill walk but it is one of the stop for scenic train.",
          "Walking across the Viaduct takes the Visitor to the City and Information Center via the Avenue. The walk gives beautiful and panoramic views of the City of Luxembourg !",
          "It\u2019s just amazing to see what people have been able to accomplish in the past. Luxembourg is such a historic place and the Viaduc is fantastic within this environment.",
          "We always look in trip advisor for things to do in each city. We had passed over this bridge a few times to get to the Palace the Grund and the centre. We then put in google maps this destination. It took us to the middle of the bridge we had crossed over a few times. Yes the",
          "The view it\"s amazing and you can take great pictures from here. You can see both sides of the city and it\"s beautiful.",
          "The Old bridge was built between 1859 & 1861 to cross the Petrusse valley at a height of 45 metres. It consists of 24 arches & the total length is 290 metres. I walked the area from end to the other. Beautiful scenery and an amazing area.",
          "The views from that walk is really amazing. Knowing the history of expansion of the city with all the old structures and details are really fantastic. Recommend it for a family with children but beware of cars passing every now and then.",
          "Nice old historic viaduct in the Luxembourg city valley with shops and churches. The river beside the viaduct give a nice nature effect.",
          "it was a nice walk esp. if the weather is nice. A bit hilly though but worth it. there is an elevator in the corner where you can see it from the top",
          "Easy to use, free and some fantastic views of the city. Wasn't too busy, so no waiting around. Worth a look to try and get a panoramic photo if nothing else!",
          "You must visit this part of Luxembourg. Good places to visit and relax. Hav\u00ea great views of the old city.",
          "The Luxembourg Viaduct also know as The Passerelle, is a bridge from City Center to the Quatier Gare. It was the first bridge built, so they call it the old bridge. From behind St. Michael's Church on the bridge overlooking the Corniche, you can get a great view of the viaduct",
          "This is a wonderful bridge that can be seen from the Casement du Bock. The entire city of Luxembourg is a great place to visit and we would highly recommend.",
          "I had a lovely walk around here - enjoying the shade! The viaduc is lovely to see from up and also below. It was clean, felt safe and had plenty of activities.",
          "Nice view of the surround areas and the river at the bottom. It's very pleasant to walk around after lunch or in an early evening. Highly recommended.",
          "It's amazing to have such view when you over the trees! Do not forget to go down below and walk under the Viaduc. Plenty of activities such as skating, mini golf and having a picnic.",
          "Wonderful time strolling thru the old city and looking over the old city below from the vast castle structures . Great place to see as you wander thru the city by foot or guide.",
          "Luxembourg is so easy to walk around, and when you get tired hop on a bus there are so many. Lovely walk to see the viaduc, and nice play area and picnic spot beneath.",
          "in fact this is the old bridge , between the old city and the new part of the city , built outside the walls",
          "Very nice first view of the fortifications and the P\u00e9trusse valley when we get to the station. Great scenery, food photos. Impressing for the years it was build. Walk under and around this area, it is riddled with walkways both below and above.",
          "At the bottom of the bridge there is a very nice and modern playground where your kids can play while you have a pick nick at one of the tables. We bought a sparkling wine and cheese in the Monoprix 5 minutes walking away and had a good (and cheap) afternoon in the sun.",
          "The main bridge into the city is the Adolphe Bridge, but with clear weather, I enjoyed a long walk from city centre back to the train station, then across this bridge to the Chemin de la Corniche. If you don't venture down into the Barrio, the walk is fairly flat and easy",
          "Great picture opportunities. Good vistas of the old city. Not the best of attraction, but if you don't mind walking, make a little time for it.",
          "Luxembourg is a great city to walk around,there should be sunshine for a perfect day in this city .just walk and have fun",
          "It is very important to have good weather in Luxembourg. The place is too beautiful for a rainy day :) You can walk the bridge and admire the surroundings. No matter what part are you looking at, the view stays perfect.",
          "Its a great city to walk around - and you can cover a lot in a few hours. some very impressive backdrops and photo opportunities",
          "Correct that the view of the valley below is good, but valley itself is very small. Old town view - you can see that in the far end. It is good to spend about 10 minutes here, not more.",
          "The old bridge gives you a perfect view of the old town. A must visit in Luxembourg. It is one of the most striking features of Luxembourg City. it is build in the terrain and the numerous hills surrounded by steep valleys and rivers The bridge is approximately 300 yards",
          "One direction motorized traffic, incentive for pedestrians and cyclists. Good initiative with stunning views on skaters in the Petrusse valley. On the way of the old town to the train station.",
          "Our first view of this was from the bridge near the Bock Casements - the vista from here was impressive, helped by spectacular April weather. Our second view was walking through the park in the valley floor - from there the sheer scale of the viaduct becomes apparent - very",
          "This is a must see place in Luxembourg city. A breathtaking view of its old city. Located on the east side from the city center.",
          "Good place to get photos- the tourist guide filled us in on the early settlement and history. Well worth getting a local guide to take you around",
          "The low altitude of the place look very stunning. The place is massive and very large across the City of Luxembourg. It is more attractive if you tried to go down in this place. It will look great!",
          "this old bridge ( la passarelle) gives you a perfect view of the old city of luxembourg, but do it on a sunny day",
          "Wen you look down its almost like your in a fairy tale. The wind softly blows as you smell the fresh air truly a wonder!",
          "Stunning view with lots of nice walks nearby. Definitely a place to take some very good holiday photos.",
          "Good photo opportunity and lovely setting seeing the old city, but we did not actually go right up to it - don't think it necessary",
          "This is a public bridge which offers a generic view of the city. Once the rehabilitation of Pont Adolphe is completed it will be a good place to take a picture with the iconic bridge in the background.",
          "Very good place to go for photos and scenery. Walk and enjoy the scenery. Good idea is to walk under the bridge and down to lesser town.",
          "I was here during December 2016. The views are amazing and it's a pretty nice walk. Pro tip: Le Chemin de la Corniche, Barrio Grund, Casemates du Bock, Viaduc you can do it in all one afternoon, they are located close to each other.",
          "This is one of the iconic structures on the Luxembourg City skyline. You can get great views of it walking along the Bock. Great looking viaduct and fortifications building into the hillsides. Definitely worth a long walk.",
          "I stayed near the base of this. The views were amazing.Good walks around the old town but the bars a bit...well as late night bars can be...(need I say more!",
          "Along with Le Chemin de la Corniche, walking around the Viaduc/Passerelle makes for a pleasant couple of hours; the views are nice and very charming. Very photogenic.",
          "Was only able to cross this at night due to visiting for business regions but it sufficiently well lit to allow you to appreciate the walls of the city",
          "This walk gave a good view of nice structures in the Luxembourg city. The walk along the bridge gave view of the depth of the park and the Grund. The walk also lead through the market with many restaurants. From the Luxembourg City train station this was just a fifteen",
          "like from most bridges in Luxembourg city, you've got great views of the Grund (an impressive lower city area, like a gorge) from here, just be careful if you change sides as the bridge has quite busy car traffic. after the bridge on your right side (when coming from the",
          "It is one the most beautiful places in Luxembourg. Luxembourg has no special tourist attraction.but it is not bad to visit it for one time",
          "We saw this viaduc/bridge in a review and walked there. The view was awesome and the photo option was great. Would recommend.",
          "Luxembourg is a small place. You can do one day trip to see it all, and I would highly recommend to include Viaduc in this.",
          "Stunning and dramatic, a fantastic passage over the Petrusse. Coming from the gare and keeping the right, it is now possible to admire the new skate park in the Petrusse from high above - a genial touch in the landscape.",
          "Old and new in the middle of the city. Truly signifies Luxembourg City I viewed from below and later walked across the viaduct. I would recommend",
          "With so many great and interesting sites to visit in Luxembourg I rate this as another must-see. If you are interested in history then the history of this city is definitely one you will like. The3 viaduct is just so strikingly different and impressive that you will not be",

          "There is not much to do and see in Luxembourg so a walk along the viaduct is a must. Spend an hour chilling along it",
          "This is one of the greatest landmarks in Luxembourg city, dominating the \"skyline\" of the city. It makes great pictures. :)",
          "nice views alongside the cliff with interesting stories behind them. Enough for like an hour of walking but not enough to fill a day.",
          "Old monument, worth visiting. I was solo travelling this place on nice Saturday morning. You can find other tourists with map in hand, not to miss out this place.",
          "A prominent landmark in the City's skyline that sits over a picturesque valley. Known also as the Old Bridge. A great piece of engineering that offers an almost birds eye view that presents great photo opportunities.",

          "Everywhere you look screams history. Some magnificent structures and buildings. So many photo opportunities. Great place to visit.",
          "Very nice and impressive. Totally recommend to cross it by foot. Can not describe the Feeling but was very interesting :-)",
          "Walking towards Luxembourg centre you can go OVER the bridge or through the valley. Down in the valley you'll come across a river and a little church. There are also little trains for the kids and the old town down below. Then if you want to go up, they've made a lift to go back",
          "The Passerelle Viaduct is in the southern part of Luxembourg city and is also known as the Old Bridge! The Adolphe Bridge is the newer one built around 1900 but was undergoing covered repairs when we were there. A must see when in Luxembourg!",
          "One of two important bridges between old and new part of Luxembourg City. Best view is from the Place de la Constitution.",
          "This was totally amazingly beautiful! We walked so much! Lots of steps and ramps, but very beautiful! We rode the elevator to get down to the little sunken city (not sure what that is called) and then walked up through the viaducts. Absolutely beautiful!",
          "It is omnipresent nearly from every point of either the city centre or the Grund. I highly recommend to explore Luxembourg by foot to see all the hidden places. When you're unter the viaduct you will find nice parks, trails, etc. which all should and want to be explored.",

          "Nice spot for good pictures of Luxembourg, especially from the valley below, good to walk by between the two parts of the city",

          "The old or the new bridge look much better from a distance, in order to take a photo, or from below if you decide to have a walk next to the river. If you decide to walk on the new bridge for example you might discover that due to the landscape and the arrangement of the city",
          "The viaduct is one of the most photographed parts of the city...can't think why except that you see it from your obligatory walk around the ramparts of the city. One tip: do take the time to walk around the city via its lovely parks, which all combine to offer a single walk",
          "please walk on both sides of this \" new \" bridge , as it is called \" new \" in contrast with the \"old\" bridge that you can see, when you walk on the side , leaving railway station side to the old city",
          "The place is gorgeous. It gives you a feel of mediaeval Europe. One can observe the influence of french and german architecture in this place.",
          "This attraction is better watched from the distance. It is very high, solid, eternal. It was built ages ago, ancient people crossed it, now modern cars. Autumn colours make it fascinating!",
          "Beautiful and should not be missed! A very nice walk revealing beautiful scenery. Should be done by day and by night!",
          "If you do one thing in Luxembourg, this should be it. Amazing views and great access to the cute side streets.",
          "The whole city is a small jewel placed on a spectacular landscape. The viaduc offers a view to the entire area around.",
          "Don't just look at the whole view from the distance, walk. There is so much to look at as each turn you make you will find a fresh breathtaking viewpoint which is great for your camera. This is one grand engineering work, the focal point of Luxembourg.",
          "Beautiful, amazing views. Make sure you walk around And held out the different views. Beautiful beautiful. Love it...",
          "Never to miss when you are in Luxembourg. A magnificent view from the top. An ancient landscape still retained in originality in this modern age. A beautiful place to relax your mind while you take a walk when you are below. There are some good restaurants to come your time. The",

          "Really nice place, it's a must to go there if you travel to Luxemburgo, there is a place from where you can enjoy and see the viaduct from a good distance near to the cathedral. There is Peking available in that place. Recommended",
          "This is one of the most impressive viaducts you will see in Europe. It is great for pictures and getting a feel for the city.",
          "This is one of the stunning views from the upper walls of the city of Luxembourg, which we also saw from the old city. It is in lovely stone and has a beautiful forested backdrop - great photo shot",
          "Scenic old bridge of Luxembourg, which due to the physical characteristics of the city offers view all over the old city...even though it is pretty small.",
          "A definite must!! Specially since LUX is rather small. You will end tired by the end of the day since LUX have up and down streets, definitely a good exercise. Even better with a sunny day.",
          "We took our 8 month old in her stroller and the cobblestones streets and paths, lulled her to sleep. We parked at ground level (on a Sunday, because then the parking is free and less traffic), and walked about 300 meters up the hill the view the viaduct, castle towers, gardens",
          "One of the highlights of our visit was the Viaduc. It seems amazing that it has survived for so long without damage. Well worth a visit",

          "Easy access to the place. Plenty of parking nearby. Great place to have your pack lunch away from the hustle and bustle. Across the street you have plenty of restaurant and shopping places. Just the view itself is stunning",
          "When you stand in the main roads of Luxemburg you see the park that's 45 meters below. Entering the park by stairs beautiful \u00e0rea to have walks or jogging or even having your lunch. Peaceful moments away from the madness of the city.",
          "This is what you'd expect to see in fairytales, the architecture is just beautiful, it's been maintained so is very much a living part of the city and not a ruin. There are passages to explore with their own history, although they can be a little claustrophobic, so watch out if",
          "Best time to take the walk is around 7PM in the summer. We took the lift down and walked upward. The view changed as the sun started to go down. We enjoyed the views from every angle and under different light. This is an amazing experience.",
          "Only 10 minutes walking distance, I really wandered by the view here. Just like in fairy tale, view was so beautiful, At first I did not know this place, then when I've had travel with train and saw this stunning view from train. I've spent more than 1 hour to explore, there",

          "The Viaduc is a must-visit for Luxembourg City. The splendid scenery (of the Upper and Grund) is rightly chosen for the tourist-image of the city. A very pleasant walk and area to explore.",
          "this amazing city view and an incredible structure. I like the garden underneath which was beautiful. and great landmark",
          "It's nice in the summer, but it's even better in the winter when it is snowing! if you like scenery, you can take your time to explore and to find the perfect photo background :)",
          "This is what you see in many pictures and postcards from Luxembourg City, so impossible to miss. Take comfy shoes, camera and enjoy the views.",
          "A must visit for all tourists, this historic bridge provides some great views of the city, our guide advised us of the places to obtain the best photographs, a walk well worth the effort indeed",

          "Full Luxembourg is like one huge miniature landscapes but in real size ... Something fairytale preferable looms over the whole scenery and you are thinking much about all the history that happened on this place over the years! The bridges over the valley is almost higher than",
          "High above the river runs the viaduct, snaking through the valley... on top sits a train, a relic of the 1980's design that was popular at the time. Very picturesque ( the whole of luxwmbourg is) but to walk among the old towers, forts, viaducts, Walls is to walk back in time.",
          "The best place to get a great view of the viaduct, and generally a great view is behind the archive building. There is a path high on the ridge that affords great views all along the canal.",

          "Surrounding the city of Luxembourg is a fortress wall encompassed with casemates. On either end of the river walk bridges up two massive viaducts. This area is wonderful for an afternoon stroll and to get lost in the green space. Buildings and nature alike find a solstice in the",
          "Everyone may not know that. But it's a great place to take pictures. I think it's as good as the viaduct from the Bernina Express in Switzerland. The scenary is good to see from not only the upper district but also the lower district.I'm sure you won't get bored with watching.",
          "combination of old city castles and new hi-tech city along with scenic beauty makes Luxembourg a wonderful destination. 2 to 3 days trip including vianden castle will be a good trip.",

          "When walking through the city center of Luxemburg, we stumbled across this place, which in our opinion offers a great and diverse view. A walk past the high up 'boulevard' offers a varied and very interesting view of the old city. \"Photo spots\" on the walkway showed the best",

        "wiki": "The history of Luxembourg consists of the history of the country of Luxembourg and its geographical area.\nAlthough its recorded history can be traced back to Roman times, the history of Luxembourg proper is considered to begin in 963. Over the following five centuries, the powerful House of Luxembourg emerged, but its extinction put an end to the country's independence. After a brief period of Burgundian rule, the country passed to the Habsburgs in 1477.\nAfter the Eighty Years' War, Luxembourg became a part of the Southern Netherlands, which passed to the Austrian line of the Habsburg dynasty in 1713. After occupation by Revolutionary France, the 1815 Treaty of Paris transformed Luxembourg into a Grand Duchy in personal union with the Netherlands. The treaty also resulted in the second partitioning of Luxembourg, the first being in 1658 and a third in 1839. Although these treaties greatly reduced Luxembourg's territory, the latter established its formal independence, which was confirmed after the Luxembourg Crisis of 1867.\nIn the following decades, Luxembourg fell further into Germany's sphere of influence, particularly after the creation of a separate ruling house in 1890. It was occupied by Germany from 1914 until 1918 and again from 1940 until 1944. Since the end of the Second World War, Luxembourg has become one of the world's richest countries, buoyed by a booming financial services sector, political stability, and European integration.\n\n\n== Early history ==\n\nIn the territory now covered by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, there is evidence of primitive inhabitants dating back to the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age over 35,000 years ago. The oldest artefacts from this period are decorated bones found at Oetrange.\nHowever, the first real evidence of civilisation is from the Neolithic or 5th millennium BC, from which evidence of houses has been found. Traces have been found in the south of Luxembourg at Grevenmacher, Diekirch, Aspelt and Weiler-la-Tour. The dwellings were made of a combination of tree trunks for the basic structure, mud-clad wickerwork walls, and roofs of thatched reeds or straw. Pottery from this period has been found near Remerschen.\nWhile there is not much evidence of communities in Luxembourg at the beginning of the Bronze Age, a number of sites dating back to the period between the 13th and the 8th century BC provide evidence of dwellings and reveal artefacts such as pottery, knives and jewellery. The sites include Nospelt, Dalheim, Mompach and Remerschen.\nWhat is present-day Luxembourg, was inhabited by Celts during the Iron Age (from roughly 600 BC until 100 AD).\nThe Gaulish tribe in what is present-day Luxembourg during and after the La T\u00e8ne period was known as the Treveri; they reached the height of prosperity in the 1st century BC. The Treveri constructed a number of oppida, Iron Age fortified settlements, near the Moselle valley in what is now southern Luxembourg, western Germany and eastern France. Most of the archaeological evidence from this period has been discovered in tombs, many closely associated with Titelberg, a 50 ha site which reveals much about the dwellings and handicrafts of the period.\nThe Romans, under Julius Caesar, completed their conquest and occupation in 53 BC. The first known reference to the territory of present-day Luxembourg was by Julius Caesar in his Commentaries on the Gallic War. The Treveri were more co-operative with the Romans than most Gallic tribes, and adapted readily to Roman civilization. Two revolts in the 1st century AD did not permanently damage their cordial relations with Rome.\nThe land of the Treveri was at first part of Gallia Celtica, but with the reform of Domitian in c. 90, was reassigned to Gallia Belgica.\nGallia Belgica was infiltrated by the Germanic Franks from the 4th century, and was abandoned by Rome in AD 406.\nThe territory of what would become Luxembourg by the 480s, became part of Merovingia Austrasia and eventually part of the core territory of the Carolingian Empire.\nWith the Treaty of Verdun (843), it fell to Middle Francia, and in 855, to Lotharingia. With the latter's division in 959, it then fell to the Duchy of Upper Lorraine within the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\n== County ==\n\nThe history of Luxembourg properly began with the construction of Luxembourg Castle in the High Middle Ages. It was Siegfried I, count of Ardennes who traded some of his ancestral lands with the monks of the Abbey of St. Maximin in Trier in 963 for an ancient, supposedly Roman, fort named Lucilinburhuc, commonly translated as \"little castle\". Modern historians link the etymology of the word with Letze, meaning fortification, which may have referred to either the remains of a Roman watchtower or to a primitive refuge of the early Middle Ages.\n\n\n== Duchy ==\n\nFrom the Early Middle Ages to the Renaissance, Luxembourg bore multiple names, depending on the author. These include Lucilinburhuc, Lutzburg, L\u00fctzelburg, Luccelemburc, and Lichtburg, among others. The Luxembourgish dynasty produced several Holy Roman Emperors, Kings of Bohemia, and Archbishops of Trier and Mainz.\nAround the fort of Luxembourg, a town gradually developed, which became the centre of a small but important state of great strategic value to France, Germany and the Netherlands. Luxembourg's fortress, located on a rocky outcrop known as the Bock, was steadily enlarged and strengthened over the years by successive owners. Some of these included the Bourbons, Habsburgs and Hohenzollerns, who made it one of the strongest fortresses on the European continent, the Fortress of Luxembourg. Its formidable defences and strategic location caused it to become known as the \u2018Gibraltar of the North\u2019.\n\n\n== Habsburg (1477\u20131795) and French (1795\u20131815) rule ==\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the electors of Brandenburg, later kings of Prussia (Borussia), advanced their claim to the Luxembourg patrimony as heirs-general to William of Thuringia and his wife Anna of Bohemia, the disputed dukes of Luxembourg in the 1460s. Anna was the eldest daughter of the last Luxembourg heiress. From 1609 onward, they had a territorial base in the vicinity, the Duchy of Cleves, the starting-point of the future Prussian Rhineland. This Brandenburger claim ultimately produced some results when some districts of Luxembourg were united with Prussia in 1813.\nThe first Hohenzollern claimant to descend from both Anna and her younger sister Elisabeth, was John George, Elector of Brandenburg (1525\u201398), his maternal grandmother having been Barbara Jagiellon. In the late 18th century, the younger line of Orange-Nassau (the princes who held sway in the neighbouring Dutch oligarchy) also became related to the Brandenburgers.\nIn 1598, the then possessor, Philip II of Spain, bequeathed Luxembourg and the other Low Countries to his daughter, the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia and her husband Albert VII, Archduke of Austria. Albert was an heir and descendant of Elisabeth of Austria (d. 1505), queen of Poland, the youngest granddaughter of Sigismund of Luxembourg, the Holy Roman Emperor. Thus, Luxembourg returned to the heirs of the old Luxembourg dynasty of the line of Elisabeth. The Low Countries were a separate political entity during the couple's reign. After Albert's childless death in 1621, Luxembourg passed to his great-nephew and heir Philip IV of Spain.\n\n\n=== French invasion ===\n\nLuxembourg was invaded by Louis XIV of France (husband of Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV) in 1684, an action that caused alarm among France's neighbors and resulted in the formation of the League of Augsburg in 1686. In the ensuing War of the Grand Alliance, France was forced to give up the duchy, which was returned to the Habsburgs by the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697.\nDuring this period of French rule, the defences of the fortress were strengthened by the famous siege engineer Vauban. The French king's great-grandson Louis (1710\u201374) was, from 1712, the first heir-general of Albert VII. Albert VII was a descendant of Anna of Bohemia and William of Thuringia, having that blood through his mother's Danish great-great-grandmother, but was not the heir-general of that line. Louis was the first real claimant of Luxembourg to descend from both sisters, the daughters of Elisabeth of Bohemia, the last Luxembourg empress.\nHabsburg rule was confirmed in 1715 by the Treaty of Utrecht, and Luxembourg was integrated into the Southern Netherlands. Emperor Joseph and his successor Emperor Charles VI were descendants of Spanish kings who were heirs of Albert VII. Joseph and Charles VI were also descendants of Anna of Bohemia and William of Thuringia, having that blood through their mother, although they were heirs-general of neither line. Charles was the first ruler of Luxembourg to descend from both sisters, daughters of Elisabeth of Bohemia.\nAustrian rulers were ready to exchange Luxembourg and other territories in the Low Countries. Their purpose was to round out and enlarge their power base, which in geographical terms was centred around Vienna. Thus, Bavarian candidate(s) emerged to take over the Duchy of Luxembourg, but this plan led to nothing permanent. Emperor Joseph II however, made a preliminary pact to make a neighbour of Luxembourg, Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine, as Duke of Luxembourg and king in the Low Countries, in exchange for his possessions in Bavaria and Franconia. However, this scheme was aborted by Prussia's opposition. Charles Theodore, who would have become Duke of Luxembourg, was genealogically a junior descendant of both Anna and Elisabeth, but the main heir of neither.\nDuring the War of the First Coalition, Luxembourg was conquered and annexed by Revolutionary France, becoming part of the d\u00e9partement of the For\u00eats in 1795.  The annexation was formalised at Campo Formio in 1797. In 1798, Luxembourgish peasants started a rebellion against the French but it was rapidly suppressed. This brief rebellion is called the Peasant's War.\n\n\n== Developing independence (1815\u20131890) ==\n\nLuxembourg remained more or less under French rule until the defeat of Napoleon in 1815. When the French departed, the Allies installed a provisional administration. Luxembourg initially came under the Generalgouvernement Mittelrhein in mid-1814, and then from June 1814 under the Generalgouvernement Nieder- und Mittelrhein (General Government Lower and Middle Rhine).\nThe Congress of Vienna of 1815, gave formal autonomy to Luxembourg. In 1813, the Prussians had already managed to wrest lands from Luxembourg, to strengthen the Prussian-possessed Duchy of Julich. The Bourbons of France held a strong claim to Luxembourg, whereas the Emperor Francis of Austria, on the other hand, had controlled the duchy until the revolutionary forces had joined it to the French republic. However, his Chancellor, Klemens von Metternich, was not enthusiastic about regaining Luxembourg and the Low Countries, as they were separated so far from the main body of the Austrian Empire.\nPrussia and the Netherlands, both claiming Luxembourg, made an exchange deal: Prussia received the Principality of Orange-Nassau, the ancestral Principality of the Prince of Orange in Central Germany; and the Prince of Orange in turn received Luxembourg.\nLuxembourg, somewhat diminished in size (as the medieval lands had been slightly reduced by the French and Prussian heirs), was augmented in another way through the elevation to the status of grand duchy and placed under the rule of William I of the Netherlands. This was the first time that the duchy had a monarch who had no claim to the inheritance of the medieval patrimony. However, Luxembourg's military value to Prussia prevented it from becoming a full part of the Dutch kingdom. The fortress, ancestral seat of the medieval Luxembourgers, was garrisoned by Prussian forces, following Napoleon's defeat, and Luxembourg became a member of the German Confederation with Prussia responsible for its defence, and a state under the suzerainty of the Netherlands at the same time.\n\nIn July 1819, a contemporary from Britain visited Luxembourg \u2014 his journal offers some insights. Norwich Duff, writes of its city that \"Luxembourg is considered one of the strongest fortifications in Europe, and \u2026 it appears so. It is situated in Holland (then as now used by English speakers as shorthand for the Netherlands) but by treaty is garrisoned by Prussians and 5,000 of their troops occupy it under a Prince of Hesse. The civil government is under the Dutch and the duties collected by them. The town is not very large but the streets are broader than [in] the French towns and clean and the houses are good.... [I] got the cheapest of hot baths here at the principal house I ever had in my life: one franc.\"\nIn 1820, Luxembourg made use of the metric system of measurement compulsory. Previously, the country had using local units such as the \"malter\" (which was equivalent to 191 litres).Much of the Luxembourgish population joined the Belgian revolution against Dutch rule. Except for the fortress and its immediate vicinity, Luxembourg was considered a province of the new Belgian state from 1830 to 1839. By the Treaty of London in 1839, the status of the grand duchy became fully sovereign and in personal union to the king of the Netherlands. In turn, the predominantly Oil-speaking geographically larger western part of the duchy was ceded to Belgium as the province de Luxembourg.\nThis loss left the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg a predominantly German state, although French cultural influence remained strong. The loss of Belgian markets also caused painful economic problems for the state. Recognising this, the grand duke integrated it into the German Zollverein in 1842. Nevertheless, Luxembourg remained an underdeveloped agrarian country for most of the century. As a result of this, about one in five of the inhabitants emigrated to the United States between 1841 and 1891.\n\n\n=== Crisis of 1867 ===\n\nIn 1867, Luxembourg's independence was confirmed, after a turbulent period which even included a brief time of civil unrest against plans to annex Luxembourg to Belgium, Germany, or France. The crisis of 1867 almost resulted in war between France and Prussia over the status of Luxembourg, which had become free of German control when the German Confederation was abolished at the end of the Seven Weeks War in 1866.\nWilliam III, king of the Netherlands, and sovereign of Luxembourg, was willing to sell the grand duchy to France's Emperor Napoleon III in order to retain Limbourg but backed out when Prussian chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, expressed opposition. The growing tension brought about a conference in London from March to May 1867 in which the British served as mediators between the two rivals. Bismarck manipulated public opinion, resulting in the denial of sale to France. The issue was resolved by the second Treaty of London which guaranteed the perpetual independence and neutrality of the state. The fortress walls were pulled down and the Prussian garrison was withdrawn.Famous visitors to Luxembourg in the 18th and 19th centuries included the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the French writers \u00c9mile Zola and Victor Hugo, the composer Franz Liszt, and the English painter Joseph Mallord William Turner.\n\n\n== Separation and the World Wars (1890\u20131945) ==\nLuxembourg remained a possession of the kings of the Netherlands until the death of William III in 1890, when the grand duchy passed to the House of Nassau-Weilburg due to the 1783 Nassau Family Pact, under which those territories of the Nassau family in the Holy Roman Empire at the time of the pact (Luxembourg and Nassau) were bound by semi-Salic law, which allowed inheritance by females or through the female line only upon extinction of male members of the dynasty. When William III died leaving only his daughter Wilhelmina as an heir, the crown of the Netherlands, not being bound by the family pact, passed to Wilhelmina. However, the crown of Luxembourg passed to a male of another branch of the House of Nassau: Adolphe, the dispossessed Duke of Nassau and head of the branch of Nassau-Weilburg.\n\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nWorld War I affected Luxembourg at a time when the nation-building process was far from complete. The small grand duchy (about 260,000 inhabitants in 1914) opted for an ambiguous policy between 1914 and 1918. With the country occupied by German troops, the government, led by Paul Eyschen, chose to remain neutral. This strategy had been elaborated with the approval of Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. Although continuity prevailed on the political level, the war caused social upheaval, which laid the foundation for the first trades union in Luxembourg.\n\n\n=== Interwar period ===\nThe end of the occupation in November 1918, squared with a time of uncertainty on the international and national levels. The victorious Allies disapproved of the choices made by the local \u00e9lites, and some Belgian politicians even demanded the (re)integration of the country into a greater Belgium. Within Luxembourg, a strong minority asked for the creation of a republic. In the end, the grand duchy remained a monarchy but was led by a new head of state, Charlotte. In 1921, it entered into an economic and monetary union with Belgium. During most of the 20th century, however, Germany remained its most important economic partner.\nThe introduction of universal suffrage for men and women favored the Rechtspartei (party of the Right) which played the dominant role in the government throughout the 20th century, with the exception of 1925\u201326 and 1974\u201379, when the two other important parties, the Liberal and the Social-Democratic parties, formed a coalition. The success of the resulting party was due partly to the support of the church \u2014 the population was more than 90 percent Catholic \u2014 and of its newspaper, the Luxemburger Wort.\nOn the international level, the interwar period was characterised by an attempt to put Luxembourg on the map. Especially under Joseph Bech, head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the country participated more actively in several international organisations, in order to ensure its autonomy. On December 16, 1920, Luxembourg became a member of the League of Nations. On the economic level in the 1920s and the 1930s, the agricultural sector declined in favour of industry, but even more so for the service sector. The proportion of the active population in this last sector rose from 18 percent in 1907 to 31 percent in 1935.\nIn the 1930s, the internal situation deteriorated, as Luxembourgish politics were influenced by European left- and right-wing politics. The government tried to counter communist-led unrest in the industrial areas and continued friendly policies towards Nazi Germany, which led to much criticism. The attempts to quell unrest peaked with the Maulkuerfgesetz, the \"muzzle\" Law, which was an attempt to outlaw the Communist Party. The law was turned down in a 1937 referendum.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the government of Luxembourg observed its neutrality and issued an official proclamation to that effect on September 6, 1939. On May 10, 1940, an invasion by German armed forces swept away the Luxembourgish government and monarchy into exile. The German troops made up of the 1st, 2nd, and 10th Panzer Divisions invaded at 04:35. They did not encounter any significant resistance save for some bridges destroyed and some land mines since the majority of the Luxembourgish Volunteer Corps stayed in their barracks. Luxembourgish police resisted the German troops, but to little avail and the capital city was occupied before noon. Total Luxembourgish casualties amounted to 75 police and soldiers captured, six police wounded, and one soldier wounded.The Luxembourg royal family and their entourage received visas from Aristides de Sousa Mendes in Bordeaux. They crossed into Portugal and subsequently travelled to the United States in two groups: on the USS Trenton from Lisbon to Baltimore in July 1940, and on the Pan American airliner Yankee Clipper in October 1940. Throughout the war, Grand Duchess Charlotte broadcast via the BBC to Luxembourg to give hope to the people.\nLuxembourg remained under German military occupation until August 1942, when the Third Reich formally annexed it as part of the Gau Moselland. The German authorities declared Luxembourgers to be German citizens and called up 13,000 for military service. 2,848 Luxembourgers eventually died fighting in the German army.\nLuxembourgish opposition to this annexation took the form of passive resistance at first, as in the Sp\u00e9ngelskrich (lit. \"War of the Pins\"), and in refusal to speak German. As French was forbidden, many Luxembourgers resorted to resuscitating old Luxembourgish words, which led to a renaissance of the language. The Germans met opposition with deportation, forced labour, forced conscription and, more drastically, with internment, deportation to Nazi concentration camps and execution.\nExecutions took place after the so-called general strike from September 1 to September 3, 1942, which paralysed the administration, agriculture, industry and education in response to the declaration of forced conscription by the German administration on August 30, 1942. The Germans suppressed the strike violently. They executed 21 strikers and deported hundreds more to Nazi concentration camps. The then civilian administrator of Luxembourg, Gauleiter Gustav Simon, had declared conscription necessary to support the German war effort. The general strike in Luxembourg remained one of the few mass strikes against the German war machine in Western Europe.\nU.S. forces liberated most of the country in September 1944. They entered the capital city on September 10, 1944. During the Ardennes Offensive (Battle of the Bulge) German troops took back most of northern Luxembourg for a few weeks. Allied forces finally expelled the Germans in January 1945.\nBetween December 1944 and February 1945, the recently liberated city of Luxembourg was designated by the OB West (German Army Command in the West) as the target for V-3 siege guns, which were originally intended to bombard London. Two V-3 guns based at Lampaden fired a total of 183 rounds at Luxembourg. However, the V-3 was not very accurate. 142 rounds landed in Luxembourg, with 44 confirmed hits in the urban area, and the total casualties were 10 dead and 35 wounded. The bombardments ended with the American Army nearing Lampaden on February 22, 1945.\nAltogether, of a pre-war population of 293,000, 5,259 Luxembourgers lost their lives during the hostilities.\n\n\n== Modern history (since 1945) ==\nAfter World War II, Luxembourg abandoned its politics of neutrality, when it became a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United Nations.  It is a signatory of the Treaty of Rome, and constituted a monetary union with Belgium (Benelux Customs Union in 1948), and an economic union with Belgium and the Netherlands, the so-called BeNeLux.\nBetween 1945 and 2005, the economic structure of Luxembourg changed significantly. The crisis of the metallurgy sector, which began in the mid-1970s and lasted till the late 1980s, nearly pushed the country into economic recession, given the monolithic dominance of that sector. The Tripartite Coordination Committee, consisting of members of the government, management representatives, and trade union leaders, succeeded in preventing major social unrest during those years, thus creating the myth of a \u201cLuxembourg model\u201d characterised by social peace. Although in the early years of the 21st century Luxembourg enjoyed one of the highest GNP per capita in the world, this was mainly due to the strength of its financial sector, which gained importance at the end of the 1960s. Thirty-five years later, one-third of the tax proceeds originated from that sector. The harmonisation of the tax system across Europe could, however, seriously undermine the financial situation of the grand duchy.\nLuxembourg has been one of the strongest advocates of the European Union in the tradition of Robert Schuman. It was one of the six founding members of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1952 and of the European Economic Community (EEC) (later the European Union) in 1957; in 1999 it joined the euro currency area.\nEncouraged by the contacts established with the Dutch and Belgian governments in exile, Luxembourg pursued a policy of presence in international organisations. In the context of the Cold War, Luxembourg clearly opted for the West having joined NATO in 1949. Engagement in European reconstruction was rarely questioned subsequently, either by politicians or by the greater population.\nDespite its small proportions, Luxembourg often played an intermediary role between larger countries. This role of mediator, especially between the two large and often bellicose nations of Germany and France, was considered one of the main characteristics of its national identity, allowing the Luxembourgers not to have to choose between one of these two neighbours. The country also hosted a large number of European institutions such as the European Court of Justice.\nLuxembourg's small size no longer seemed to be a challenge to the existence of the country, and the creation of the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg (1998) and of the University of Luxembourg (2003) was evidence of the continuing desire to become a \u201creal\u201d nation. The decision in 1985 to declare L\u00ebtzebuergesch (Luxembourgish) the national language was also a step in the affirmation of the country's independence. In fact, the linguistic situation in Luxembourg was characterised by trilingualism: L\u00ebtzebuergesch was the spoken vernacular language, German the written language, in which Luxembourgers were most fluent, and French the language of official letters and law.\nIn 1985, the country became victim to a mysterious bombing spree, which was targeted mostly at electrical masts and other installations.\nIn 1995, Luxembourg provided the president of the European Commission, former Prime Minister Jacques Santer, who later had to resign over corruption accusations against other commission members.\nPrime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, followed this European tradition. On 10 September 2004, Mr Juncker became the semi-permanent president of the group of finance ministers from the 12 countries that share the euro, a role that led him to be dubbed \"Mr Euro\".\nThe present sovereign is Grand Duke Henri. Henri's father, Jean, succeeded his mother, Charlotte, on 12 November 1964. Jean's eldest son, Prince Henri, was appointed \"Lieutenant Repr\u00e9sentant\" (Hereditary Grand Duke) on 4 March 1998. On 24 December 1999, Prime Minister Juncker announced Grand Duke Jean's decision to abdicate the throne on 7 October 2000, in favour of Prince Henri who assumed the title and constitutional duties of Grand Duke.\nOn July 10, 2005, after threats of resignation by Prime Minister Juncker, the proposed European Constitution was approved by 56.52% of voters.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of monarchs of Luxembourg\nList of Prime Ministers of Luxembourg\nPolitics of Luxembourg\nHistory of rail transport in Luxembourg, 1846 to present dayGeneral:\n\nHistory of Europe\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nP\u00e9port\u00e9, Pit; Kmec, Sonja; Majerus, Beno\u00eet and Margue, Michel Inventing Luxembourg.

          "Interesting museum. There is a lot to see and we did not have time to see it all before the museum closed. However, there's not many exhibits that have English descriptions. So unless you understand French, you may struggle understanding most of it. It is free to visit though, so it's worth going.",
          "Gallery with many interesting paintings and archeology interests! \nFree enterance for permanent exhibition is a great +! \nThe only thing for me is that elevator and stairs around elevator are glass. And the 3rd floor is pretty high for me. \u2026",
          "There are several levels above and under the ground level (there are actually 5 underground levels) starting with the most modern exhibits on the top and going back in time as you move to the lower levels. There is hardly any English on \u2026",
          "There was so much going on at this museum!\nSeeing it at night was a cool spectacle for sure.\nI really enjoyed all the exhibits. Did go through them very quickly, but for a committed museum-goer this definitely has much to explore.",

          "This museum could be a lot better. I got rather bored with large number of displays of old furniture and household appliances. It also adopts a tone of looking down upon the Luxembourg people for being residents of a small country. Odd.",

          "We found it accidentally while walking to Casemate du Bock, but later returned, since the building looked very attractive. It turned out, the museum is free of charge! It is also open until 6 p.m and until 8 p.m Thursdays. It is a perfect place if you want to see art and history",

          "How good it is that this museum is free, it invites people to come and have a look at history and art. The artefacts are nicely displayed, the art (contemporary) is interesting too.",
          "I went on a Sunday to this Luxembourgese museum and I was really impressed. Not necessarily with the collections housed there, but with the whole experience of the museum. The way it is built and arranged offers a true cultural and historical experience. Do not miss it! you will",
          "Wonderful museum with great exhibits. Plan at least an hour. Location is good and easy to access. Worth a visit!",
          "Even though Luxembourg has a few museums, they are big and different from most of the countries' museums.",
          "I was on my own for a day in the city, I had done all the obvious walks etc on previous visits and decided to give this museum a go, despite the fact that the facade had always put me off. I am so glad I did, the museum was terrific. So much to see, fine art, building",
          "Very well organized. Everything about history, tradition, art, culture of luxemburg. You have also a very good ciew to the city",

          "We went particularly to see the Roman artifacts, which filled 3 sections of 3 floors of this museum. The museum has no entrance fee to see its standard exhibits, but there was a big show of \"Mummies!\" for which they were charging a fee. After 3 hours, we couldn't take in any",
          "worth visiting, it's one of the cases where the setup of the museum itself is as interesting as the showpieces.",
          "yes apart from the , in my eyes, wrong dating, you first can see, the undergrounds of luxembourg -city, that's fine, but this museum has also some remarkable paintings of luxemburgers from the 1800's, AND they do not show them often, they have a collection of the photographs",
          "Very modern building hosting artefacts from Luxembourg's history that date hundreds of years. Worth visiting.",
          "The building that houses the museum is itself worth seeing. It is truly stunning inside combining old and new, linked by an amazing stairwell that goes down as many floors as it goes up, The collections are eclectic including art, as well as historical artefacts from the Roman",
          "I saw the exhibition about mummies and if you are a fan of those, don't miss it! Although don't go before dinner like I did... your apptetite will be sorely spoiled! Wish I would have had the time to see the other exhibitions as well.",
          "This Museum offers more than 6000 m2 of exhibition space dedicated to archeological, historical and other collections of art.There are 4 suggested tours: Archeology from pr\u00e9historic times to the Middle Ages; Also Painting and Sculptures frim the 14 th century to present day:",
          "Outside the museum looks modern and not very historic. Inside it's a different story - what looks like remains of an old building are built into the museum floors extremely well. The floors are for different exhibitions and on September 2015 everything was great. I felt like a",
          "Good variety of exhibits over 10 floors - there really is something for everyone. Worth an hour or so. And 90% of it is free.",
          "Altough the collections are nothing striking, the museum is wonderful. It focuses on the Luxemburg history and gives you a clear idea of the development of human societies in in this part of Europe. Explanations are given in different languages (for the English you get",
          "Very airy and unworn museum. Most artworks had an explanatory text which is nice when you're not very experienced with modern art.",
          "Compact museum with good selection of pictures and sculptures. You won't find any masterpiece here, but that is okay since the permanent collection is free of charge.",
          "The museum is very well realized, in different floors that are to be visited from the lower to the upper, starting from the paleolithic to our times. The lower floors are excavated in the rock, which is left uncovered and helps in creating a good atmosphere to appreciate the",
          "The museum is in a modern building with displays on various levels which can be accessed via a very slow lift or by walking up lots of flights of stairs. The day we visited they had a mummy display which has some very interesting exhibits but this is a traditional type museum",
          "The museum just re-opened and I have to say it makes the best of the inventory it has - in a way the museum itself is nicer than the exhibits. Great work.",
          "They just re-opened some of their exhibits in the spring, and it's fantastic. They have books on each floor in various languages - other than English I didn't notice what others. They also have some explanations that make the exhibits easier to understand for those of us who",
          "I was with my kid and the visit takes 2 hours even more if you take a look of all d\u00e9tails. there are 7-8 floors starting with the prehistorical in the down floor to the top where there are regular art exposition: the building itself deserve a visit a must to see when you are in",
          "This got a good write up in my guide book but by international standards- very average. Set over several floors with the lowest starting with prehistoric times. The best floor is the one with a mosaic floor but nothing you cannot see elsewhere to be honest. The art collections",
          "There's a great amount of art and archeological history in the museum (which is built over part of an old castle), dating from the bronze age, through Roman occupation, into the Middle ages. It provides a lot of Luxembourg history and would be more enjoyable if there were more",
          "A beautiful museum with clear exhibits and thoughtfully put together. On the day of our visit it was extremely quiet, meaning you could view the exhibits in peace and quiet",
          "nice little museum spread out out over several floors, tip is to start at the top with the modern art and work your way down to the bottom. Gives a good background into luxembourgs history is worth visiting",

          "We wanted to see some paintings, preferably impressionists. The only place we could find for this in Luxembourg City was this MNHA. What is strange from the very beginning is that such a wealthy city with such a history has a single museum for both history and arts. The",
          "The magnificent 3rd century Roman era mosaics and the Italian late Renaissance painting by Il Rosso \"Bacchus, Venus et l'Amour\" alone are worth the trip!",
          "The musem is well worth a visit, 10 floors so pleanty to see. The GreenArt Cafe staff and drinks were just wonderful - webinar to run on an annual leave day meant i set up a little office in the corner - they were so welcoming and helpful!!",
          "We have visited this museum several times, but we always find something new! The kids love it. Since the museum has been restructured it is very easy to go through the different centuries.",

          "Nice museum housed in unique building. The lowest floor starts with prehistoric artifacts, including a couple of interesting reconstructions of prehistoric dwellings. History progresses the higher you get in the building, which seems to be very wheelchair accessible, btw. The",
          "An excellent museum to learn about the early history of Luxembourg, more limited on the Art side. Whilst there try out their cafe which does very good and relatively inexpensive lunches.",
          "We enjoyed this museum very much, especially the lowest floor with prehistoric artifacts. Unfortunately, the upper (middle ages) floor was closed while we were there. We visited on an evening when it was free which helps families on a budget.",
          "Great architecture, good display items but they do have some very weird portraits on the top floor. Super expensive cafe as well, but in their defence they have an amazing buffet.",
          "Eclectic and interesting for the Roman ruins. Some interesting period art as well. Overall, enjoyable and not overwhelming. A nice intro to Luxembourg.",
          "The best art museum I've ever been. You can see arts from different period as well as a long history of Luxembourg.",
          "Lots to see here. Several floors, start in the basement and move up through time with each floor representing a new period in human history. It was very interesting and would even be worth a couple of visits.",

          "The building is beautiful, but the exhibitions have been disappointing lately.",
          "Very well designed and appointed museum, focusing on historical finds in the area. 10 floors, of which 6 underground. Highly recommended!",

          "A visit here shows Luxembourg's history from the beginning - stone age - roman empire - celts etc coming up to modern times. Beautiful permanent exhibitions, but also temporary exhibitions showing art in all it's splendor.",
          "We visited the Museum on a Thursday evening (free entrance 5-8pm Thurs) at the same time as the opening of a new exhibit (we were still able the wander through the museum without disturbing this). The museum is quite a special tour of the art and archaeology of Lux with 8 (? I",
          "It took me several hours to go through all the floors of this museum, even though I didn't bother reading any of the piece descriptions. The descriptions are written in, I think, French and German. There are English guidebooks you can pick up on each floor, but I couldn't be",
          "I've visited quite a lot of museums of Roman stuff over the years, but I think this has to be one of my favourites! Though it is not the most massive museum in the universe, its content is of very high quality (the Roman wall plaster and mosaics are the best I've seen north of",
          "The museum is very well organized, nit and try to embrace different periods and things that seems important for Luxembourg. Despite being not too big, I would definetely recommend it. The Roman artifacts and mosaics are awsome!",
          "We went to this museum on Sunday morning and were pleased to find that it was free for students. Audioguides were available to be hired by leaving a deposit of money or an identity card. The museum is designed nicely over different floors. As with all museums we spent too long",
          "A fabulous modern building allows exhibits to be displayed in a way other museums would die for... Most labelling in French or German not English though. Lower floors house the museum including the lovely mosaic floor. Upper floors have a wide ranging art amd photographic",
          "On Sundays pretty much everything is closed in Luxembourg. But not the museums! The National Museum of Art and History is worth visiting for the great Roman Mosaic and Joseph Kutter's huge paintings. We were also able to see a great exhibition of Latvian symbolists and Victor",
          "Luxembourg is not really a big country \u2013 it\u00b4s quite the contrary. With not even half a million of inhabitants you can say that it\u00b4s rather pretty small.

        "wiki": "Jean (Jean Beno\u00eet Guillaume Robert Antoine Louis Marie Adolphe Marc d'Aviano; 5 January 1921 \u2013 23 April 2019) was the Grand Duke of Luxembourg from 1964 until his abdication in 2000. He was the first Grand Duke of Luxembourg of French agnatic descent.\nJean was the eldest son of Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Felix. Jean's primary education was initially in Luxembourg, before attending Ampleforth College in England. In 1938, he was officially named Hereditary Grand Duke as heir to the throne of Luxembourg. While Luxembourg was occupied by Germans during the Second World War, the grand ducal family was abroad in exile. Jean studied at the Universit\u00e9 Laval in Quebec City. Jean later volunteered to join the British army's Irish Guards in 1942, and after graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, received his commission in 1943. He participated in the Normandy landings and the Battle for Caen, and joined the Allied forces in the liberation of Luxembourg. From 1984 until 2000, he was colonel of the Irish Guards.\nOn 9 April 1953, Jean married Princess Jos\u00e9phine Charlotte of Belgium with whom he had five children. On 12 November 1964, Grand Duchess Charlotte abdicated and Jean succeeded her as Grand Duke of Luxembourg. He then reigned for 36 years before he himself abdicated on 7 October 2000 and was succeeded by his son, Grand Duke Henri.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJean was born on 5 January 1921, at Berg Castle, in central Luxembourg, the son of Grand Duchess Charlotte and of Prince F\u00e9lix. Among his godparents was Pope Benedict XV, who gave him his second name. He attended primary school in Luxembourg, where he continued the initial stage of secondary education. He completed secondary school at Ampleforth College, a Roman Catholic boarding school in the United Kingdom. Upon reaching maturity, on 5 January 1939 he was styled 'Hereditary Grand Duke', recognising his status as heir apparent.\n\n\n== Second World War ==\nOn 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, beginning a four-year occupation. Having been warned of an imminent invasion, the Grand Ducal Family escaped the previous night. At first, they sought refuge in Paris, before fleeing France only weeks later. The Grand Ducal Family sought refuge in the United States, renting an estate in Brookville, New York. Jean studied Law and Political Science at Universit\u00e9 Laval, Quebec City.He joined the British Army as a volunteer in the Irish Guards in November 1942. After receiving officer training at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, Jean was commissioned as a lieutenant on 30 July 1943, before being promoted to captain in 1944. He landed in Normandy on 11 June 1944, and took part in the Battle for Caen and the liberation of Brussels. On 10 September 1944, he took part in the liberation of Luxembourg before moving on to Arnhem and the invasion of Germany. He relinquished his commission in the British Army on 26 June 1947. From 1984 until his abdication, he served as Colonel of the Regiment of the Irish Guards, often riding in uniform behind Queen Elizabeth II during the Trooping the Colour.\n\n\n== Reign ==\n\nJean was named Lieutenant-Representative of the Grand Duchess on 28 April 1961. He became Grand Duke when his mother, Grand Duchess Charlotte, abdicated on 12 November 1964. The same day, he was made a General of the Armed Forces of Luxembourg.From the beginning of his reign, Grand Duke Jean's priorities included the well-being of his people and the completion of European unity. In the words of President Georges Pompidou of France, \"If Europe had to choose a hereditary president, it would certainly be the Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\". Indeed, during his reign Grand Duke Jean saw Luxembourg transformed from a minor industrial contributor into an international financial centre. In 1986, he was honoured with the Charlemagne Prize in Aachen for his efforts towards European integration.The Grand Duke's reign was one of the most prosperous periods in the history of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The degree of stability in the country's politics, economy and social life was without precedent, thanks in part to the influence of the Grand Duke and his wife. He abdicated on 7 October 2000, and was succeeded on the throne by his son Henri.Luxembourg's museum of modern art Mudam was officially named \"Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean\" to commemorate his reign which lasted 36 years. It was inaugurated in his presence in July 2006.\n\n\n== Retirement and death ==\n\nIn the summer of 2002, Grand Duke Jean and Grand Duchess Jos\u00e9phine Charlotte took up residence at Fischbach Castle. After his wife died in January 2005, the Grand Duke continued to live there alone. On 27 December 2016, Grand Duke Jean was hospitalized due to bronchitis and was discharged from hospital on 4 January 2017, a day before he celebrated his 96th birthday.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nSurrounded by his family, Grand Duke Jean died at 00.25 CEST on 23 April 2019 at the age of 98 after he had been hospitalized for a pulmonary infection. \nHe had become the world's oldest living monarch by the time of his death.His funeral was held on Saturday, 4 May at the Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg after a period of mourning of 12 days.\n\n\n=== Tributes ===\nJean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission and former prime-minister of Luxembourg, described Jean's death as \"a great loss for the Grand Duchy and for Europe\". He added, \"Like all the people of Luxembourg, I had great esteem for this man of commitment, kindness and courage.\"Luxembourg's prime-minister, Xavier Bettel, alluded to his service in the Second World War: \"Grand Duke Jean fought for our freedom, for our independence and for the unity of our country and we will always be grateful. A family man left us today. A great statesman, a hero, an example \u2013 and a very beloved and gracious man.\"Tributes followed from the Belgian royal family, commenting \"His courage, his dignity and his high sense of duty will remain as an example... The whole of Belgium shares the grief of the Luxembourg people\"In their tribute, the Dutch royal family mentioned \"the friendship and warmth he radiated\", adding \"With his thoughtfulness and humanity, he added to calm and confidence in his country and Europe.\"In the tribute from the Romanian Royal Family via a post on their websites, they mentioned that \u201cThe entire Royal Family of Romania is alongside the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in these sad and painful moments\u201d; also written was their very close relations (via Queen Anne who was a paternal first cousin of his) as well as \u201ca lifetime of friendship\u201d; the head of the family, Crown Princess Margareta, sent a letter of condolences to her cousin, Grand Duke HenriThe president of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach paid tribute to Grand Duke Jean who had joined the IOC in 1946 and had been an honorary member since 1998. \"He was always a very calm and well-balanced person who was highly respected by the entire Olympic Movement because of his integrity... The IOC will always hold him in the highest honour and with the greatest respect.\"\n\n\n== Marriage and family ==\n\nIn October 1952, Jean was officially engaged to Princess Jos\u00e9phine Charlotte of Belgium, the only daughter of King Leopold III of the Belgians and his first wife, Princess Astrid of Sweden. There had been speculation that the marriage was arranged to improve relations between Luxembourg and Belgium but it soon became apparent that a love match was blooming between two longtime friends.They were married in Luxembourg on 9 April 1953, first in the Hall of Ceremonies at the Grand Ducal Palace, later in Luxembourg's Notre-Dame Cathedral. The marriage put an end to the tensions between Luxembourg and Belgium which arose from 1918 to 1920 when there had been a threat of annexation. The couple had five children, 22 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren:\nArchduchess Marie Astrid, Archduchess Carl Christian of Austria (17 February 1954) she married Archduke Carl Christian of Austria on 6 February 1982. They have five children and nine grandchildren.\nGrand Duke Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (16 April 1955), he married Mar\u00eda Teresa Mestre y Batista on 14 February 1981.

There is certainly something for everyone at this museum.\n\nBring the kids for a creative session with one of their instructors.\n\nGreat initiatives to introduce art to people of all ages.",

          "Always had a good time there. Interesting exhibitions for all and the cafe has a good vibe. The only thing I wish for is a nicer espresso that does not burn you. On the other hand the home made lemonade makes up partly for it.",
          "One of the best exhibitions I've seen in my life. Very interesting building too. Would totally recommend checking out this gallery.",
          "Superb building. Nice staff. Some nice pieces though it could have more. Still worth a visit without a doubt. Recommended.",
          "People who works in every exhibition room stare at you too obviously and make you uncomfortable (they even stare at you when you just relaxing in the seat) \nif you are not a white person.\nBeing white is such a privilege.",
          "Lovely space just to walk around in! The window space is so nice whether sunny or cloudy. The cafe area is very nice too! Would highly recommend.",
          "Gorgeous inside and right next to a park with pretty city views. Wish there were more pices to see though - such a big space and I walked through it so quickly!",
          "Best cafe in Luxembourg is in Madam.  Amazing light coming from big windows and feels as if you are in outside but surrounded by arts.",
          "Nice building and good art exhibits but rather small. Our favourite was The Last Resort by Anri Sala!",
          "Nice building with interesting exhibitions. Unfortunately one of the bigger ones was changing while I was there (and thus unavailable) but still worth the 8 euro or whatever I paid!",
          "Lovely museum. Magnificent building by famous architect I M Pei who also designed The Louvre in Paris. The interior is very impressive with large, light spaces. We stayed for more or less 2 hours to see all the expositions. They were very \u2026",

          "Go on Wednesday free days. There is also a nice coffee. Worth visiting.",
          "The museum is at a very beautiful location and the building is very cool and suitable for this museum. There are beautiful items exhibited, some strange as well just like in every modern art museum. There is a very nice shop with very cool \u2026",
          "I think that the museum itself is a fantastic construction. So beautiful! But the exhibitions and collections shown are not the high level. I've been here several times and not a single once there was something worthy. I hope that they will do better in future.",
          "great architecture by Ieoh Ming Pei",
          "Very nice and modern place to visit!Great museum with very fresh ideas and projects!",
          "Awesome. A living entanglement of physics, calculus, music, imagination, curiosity and hapiness and staff. A true 6 stars in a 1-5 scale.",

          "The MUDAM (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne) is worth a visit if you are in Luxembourg. The modern building designed by the famous architect Ieoh Ming Pei is built on top of the remainders of the old fortifications of Luxembourg city. The building has \u2026",
          "The musical upsidedown drums (not sure what else to call it) were the most amazing thing to see and listen to. The surroundings is also very eye-catching and peaceful... Must visit atleast once.",
          "Current exhibits were not really for my taste, but the building is cool. Worth to walk there to see Al the sights in Luxemburg along the way",
          "Beautiful and great expositions. Worth your time!",
          "An excellent modern art museum. Regularly changes exhibits as well.",
          "Gorgeous. Didn't get to see the whole place but what I saw was impressive.",
          "Great place. My high recommendation",
          "Elegant architecture, some collections are quite inspiring. It is embeded in a historical fort with panoramic view towards the vally. Worthy to visit.",
          "very positively surprised after long trip.",
          "Amazing building but very difficult to find. Most galleries were out of bounds when we visited. Was definitely not worth the effort getting there, we were very disappointed",

          "Very nice museum, real fan of the architecture!",
          "I really loved this place, the feeling you get when you are surrounded by the gorgeous building is fantastic.  I did enjoy the building more than the art, but probably enjoyed the art more because the building provided such great light, \u2026",
          "Nice areas. Uninteresting art. High prices for very little. Two stars just because of the beautiful lobby though.",
          "It is a modern art museum. Few I found amazing, others were less interesting for me. Definitely worth the trip there. For students its free (as usually all museum in Lux) and you can view it in an hour or so. If you like cool structures ad I do then you will enjoy the building's main hall itself as well.",
          "Lovely building and setting, the exhibitions are a bit all over the place, both literally and figuratively. Only worth a visit if you're into proper modern art, which I am not \ud83d\ude09",
          "Beautiful building but the exhibition is questionable to say the least. I would skip it if I knew what\u2019s inside :-/",
          "The art was the typical insulting modern art trash (a large wall that had been scribbled all over and a 30 minute movie wherein an old woman rambled about nothing in particular) except for a few pieces. The building and surrounding area are \u2026",
          "Very nice museum. The building itself is a piece of art.",
          "Nice Museum with good facilities!",
          "It is modern art museum and the fee was 7 euro when I visited. The collection is quite large and well curated and organized. The price was worth it. Plan for anything between 1 to 3 hrs depending on your interest level. There are direct buses available from the city center.",
          "I enjoyed a few of the pieces, there was a large section of featured artist that was not interesting to me. You must a have reservation to eat at the cafe. This seemed exceptionally odd.",
          "Beautifully designed museum with modern art installations. It's a vast place and could certainly do with a few more installations to worth the visit. Either way, the architecture itself is good enough to justify a visit!",
          "Exciting exhibits presented with enough \"breathing space\" to allow for processing.",
          "Great architecture on the outside and fantastic collection inside. Although there were only 4 exhibition rooms open as of March 15, the quality is top notch. The booklet is well made and has one of the artworks on the back, pretty good for hanging somewhere.",
          "On Wednesday open till 22",
          "Everything is striking against this I M Pei masterpiece.",
          "Excellent building. Interesting art. Go!",
          "A beautiful place to visit with several exposition to see.",
          "The space is big, stylish and luminous, which makes walking through its wide corridors a pleasant experience. The content, however, depends on how much you're into modern art and how lucky you are with the temporary exhibitions showing at the moment.",
          "A very bright, spacious and pleasant museum. The exhibition I visited wasn't very big, but it filled my time nicely. The caf\u00e9 is very inviting and, if I recall correctly, not expensive.",
          "The building is nice but the artwork is nog very impressive. Given the wealth of Luxembourg I would have expected to see works from more famous artists.",
          "Interesting building and art. Also lovely views from inside",
          "Lovely exhibition space, lots of fascinating angles and views but could do with a bit more content",
          "A breathtaking sense of light and headroom",
          "I understand the idea behind modern art, but I find the items displayed rather scarce and not what I expected.",
          "The collection might not be the best in the world yet, but the building is amazing. Do not forget to walk behind the building to admire the best view on the Luxembourg City skyline.",
          "The Building is visible from many points around the old town of Luxembourg, so we decided going there using two elevators and a funicular. From outside the modern Building fits well on top of the ancient fortress battlements.\n\nWhen stepping \u2026",

          "Few pieces of art for how big the place is.",
          "A nice museum in architect terms but staff is very unpolite. Most of them just speak French and think everyone has to speak or understand French! . Not children friendly at all. They call attention screaming in French even if children are \u2026",
          "Quite small museum for modern art but had great film collections and a few interesting works.",
          "We had our reservations about going here but it\u2019s well and truly the best place to visit whilst in Luxembourg. Well and truly worth the paltry \u20ac7 entry fee. We spent a couple of hours looking around and it\u2019s got some great views too.",
          "Gorgeous museum. There where some great exhibitions going on while we were there. The kids (6y & 7y) loved it. Easy parking close to the museum as well. Totally recommend it.",
          "One of the best moder art museum I've seen in my life! Casual atmosphere, interesting and wide collection, lots of events.\n\nEven the location and the surroundings of the main building are something that should keep everyone more than pleased.",
          "A really inspirational place. I presume that galleries vary over time.\nYou should visit it when you're visiting Luxembourg city. It is located in the more modern/new part of town.\nYou can find there art in form of pictures, drawings, \u2026",

          "The museum is at the exact place where there used to be a castle. If you go behind the museum (which is not obvious and we did it incidentally), you will see the ruines of the castle and the walls which is truly interesting and exciting. The museum itself is excellent and is worth visiting for sure, especially in hot weather",
          "It's such a beatifull museum in its architecture. But the curatorial work and the collection of the museum lack in contemporary aspects. The space as well could held more events and be adptated to contemporary art, such as performances, \u2026",

          "Museum has a nice cafeteria",
          "I love the museum. Itis well organized and the architecture alone is an experience, even after having been there a few times. It's just mesmerizing to see the art and architecure combined with the view of the surrounding nature and old \u2026",
          "Very nice place and cozy place to have coffee after visit. Students are free",

          "The building is marvelous. \nThe exhibitions are... I can't tell because I know absolutely nothing about modern art. I visited 2 exhibitions at the MUDAM and the only thing I can say is that they are... interesting. They probably have a meaning and a purpose. I hope. Again, I know nothing... :-)",

          "I was not very impressed by the current exhibition to be honest.\nThe building is nice and the location superb (although quite far from the other museums).\nWith another temporary exhibition I would probably have liked it a lot more, this one was just not the right one for me.",
          "Its a very nice way to show modern architecture and art. Good for birthday parties and one can go there for a cheap price so you can go there after work or if you have free time. It normally isn't very full there.",
          "Surprisingly small for a museum that looks big. Am not a fan of abstract modern art but there are enough interesting pieces. If you're a student 26 and below you get in for free!",

The entrance fee is \u20ac7 for adults which is good value. ",
          "Not normally a fan of modern art, but the collection of exhibits in MUDAM is a variety of jaw dropping and mind boggling. Some of it makes little sense to me, and begs the question of the artists sanity, but on the whole this was a great museum to visit. The building itself is a magnificent spectacle to behold.",

          "This place is full of the weird and the weirder, as with most modern art galleries. Quite how a television showing a speech by Richard Nixon on loop can be considered art is anyone's guess, but nevertheless my visit was an interesting experience. The glass roof in the atrium",

          "Perhaps it is also because I am not into the very liberal part of Modern art, but most of what was exposed did not speak to me particularly. The building is nevertheless very impressive (also in rain/thunder!) and if you are into modern art in its most free form it is worth a",

          "Exhibitions are sometimes interesting and sometimes nothing special, it really depends on the moment, while the architecture -from outside- seems to be a mix of an industrial building and a glass church. The park around it is enchanting on a sunny day and the panoramic view over",
          "I admit that going to visit this museum wasn't high on my agenda during my stay in Luxembourg but on our last day we had time to kill before our flight home and the other half loves a bit of modern art so it seemed like a good plan. I was pleasantly surprised by how lovely the",
          "Interesting and beautiful museum. Collection is great as well. Even worth a visit for the building on its own. A bit unsettling that the museumstaff follows you around everywhere you go in the museum but understandable since the art that's displayed is mostly from private",
          "This is a relatively small museum hidden behind the philharmonic but designed beautifully. Take some time to check it out.",
          "The staff here are beyond rude and follow you around making you feel like you are a criminal. It's hugely unsettling and I left ASAP. Pity as some of the installations looked good but the museum police don't allow lovely reflection. Awful awful awful. But the fortress behind is",
          "I loved this museum for so many reasons. I approached it from the side of the old fortifications, and the modern glass architecture of MUDAM is striking against the 1000+ year old walls. It's a great size, not too tiring to walk around in a few hours and you're not bored by",
          "Great place to get in touch with a different type of art. Thank you for making the effort of bringing modern art to the Duchy. When would it be a POP art expo? Thanks",
          "If you love modern art, have a visit here. The building itself is modern and the art collection will make you think and think and think !! The movie of the nuclear detonations is worth seeing . It has a very nice cafe too to have a good break after all those thinking !!! :)",
          "well worth a visit - great modern light building set on the foundations of the old fortifications. Thought provoking and interesting installations and films, better than average modern art and well worth a few hours visit",
          "This museum building is worth a visit as much as the work on show. Very interesting modern architecture in the centre of the old fort. Thought provoking work and a delightful cafe.",
          "If not for its collection, for sure for the quality of the installments and exhibitions, as well as for the location and architecture of its seat. I believe this museum is really one of the best across Europe. The dimension of Luxembourg makes it always a good option to visit",
          "Featuring multiple exhibits over the year, and employing really friendly staff, this cheap museum is a very easy place to visit and fill your brain with culture. They also have a very nice cafe/restaurant, hosting corporate lunches during the week, with very nice wines! If",

          "The museum is a little perl. We saw a fountain springing with black ink, elegant trees of metal and a carpentry workshop in a blue room. The workshop made entirely of raw pieces of wood. Everything made in honor of the artists father. The sight will remain in my memory for a",
          "I was alone in Luxembourg city the last two days and the Mudam was the perfect place to visit. One has to have an open mind when viewing modern art. I found it refreshing to have young people at each room to ask any questions. Some of the displays I just shook my head at, but",

          "I went to see the collection Damage Control... exposition overall was average... I found the concept too abstract; specially the Yoko Ono movie. Art is suppose to raise a reaction on the viewer and here the reaction for most of the pieces presented is: mmmmm......puzzled...am I",
          "Actually, the art collection is quite limited. Rumour has it that the money ran out when the building was constructed. Some interesting works though, but it is mainly the building you should see. Historical fortress is nicely integrated in hypermodern architecture.",
          "There were some interesting exhibits in this museum and we spent quite a while walking around. Note that you need to place bags in the lockers for which you will need a 1 or 2 euro coin",
          "Impressive modern designed building, offering multilevel display areas with natural lighting. Present exhibition features an unusual subject-Destruction and is displayed in a variety of forms,including scale model of USA train crash, Nuclear explosions, to destruction of a full",
          "of course it always depends on the current exhibition if you enjoy a stay at an art museum. But in this case you should not miss it anyway, as the location and the architecture are just great and there is a very good cafeteria inside!",
          "The museum is a design lover's paradise. First, subscribe to their newsletter so that you can adjust your stay in Luxembourg to one of the many awesome (and free) workshops or a fantastic exhibition opening. You may want to catch one of the art history lectures or some other",
          "Coming from Oxford, I suppose my expectations are raised - with Oxford Modern Art hoisting prize winning exhibitors - but here, I just felt a bit sorry for the curator. Not what I expected. Sorry, but not impressed.",
          "We are visiting a lot of modern art museums around the world. These one was the worst so far. There was a big hall with a lot of paintings. White but empty. Black but nothing. A few furnitures in another room, prototypes only. A few kids from a school class visited the place.",
          "I live in Luxembourg, so it was not my first time visiting Mudam. I usually like the place, the atmosphere, the architecture, the restaurant-bar, the food, and the black fountain is my favourite there. I can sit for a long time watching this black ink fountaining. It's just",
          "This was an interesting visit, with a range of modern art on display. Two of the five floors were closed, which may not have helped, but we felt that the collections were relatively disjointed and not particularly imaginatively interpreted in comparison to some of the other",
          "Modern art is quite baffling to me, I often struggle to get the message the artist is trying to convey. But this place is not just about the art, its about the whole environment. Outside there are some great views towards the old town, inside the building itself is a great",
          "Fantastic contemporary building, worth going to have a coffee in their cafe which is a very calm, bright area with trees growing inside and an indoor felted gazebo to sit under. 3euro for a coffee and 4euro for a tea but a relaxing experience with comfy armchairs. We got in for",
          "It's a small museum, but it had interesting exhibits. Quite avant-garde. Sculptures outside were really good.",
          "Something about this museum does not lend itself to being loved, but you might hate it. I liked it. It is 5\u20ac to get in and has 6 main rooms that feature special exhibits from contemporary artists around the world. You might like it because... 1. It has an eerie, yet open",
          "First, there is the misnomer: it isn't modern art, its contemporary art. Luxembourg doesn't have any Picassos or Kandinskys. So for a budget of 600.000 euros a year, the Mudam buys some contemporary art and, occasionally, shows an excentric exhibition. Do you love garbage on the",
          "The exhibits at the museum were trying so very hard to be interesting. But they are not. Modern art should still strike you as art when you view it and not as something done by a kindergarten child learning to express themselves. 5 euro entry. The museum itself is beautiful",
          "The first clue was the weeds in the parking lot, and the lack of signage directing us to the front door. Luckily, entry was free, because an exhibit was being installed. What we did see in our fifteen-minute visit was thoroughly unimpressive, in both vision and execution. It's",
          "Due to an installation, only one level of the museum was open to the public. On the other hand, they didn't charge admission due to the installation. What I did see was interesting.",
          "I finally dragged myself up to the Mudam to see what all the fuss was about. It was a while ago now but I couldn't be bothered to write a review at the time. I am neither false nor arty and modern art to me is a lot of hot air been blown up yer wotsit by people jumping on the",
          "The Mudam is a beautifully designed building sitting on top of an old fortified site. The surroundings are similarly attractive. The best thing inside is the cafe which is very good. The art exhibits are mostly terrible and some are insulting to the intelligence. Not art at all",
          "Very interesting art in a modern building in a rather touristy, but seemingly difficult to get to, area of Luxembourg. Exhibits ranged from quirky to thought-provoking and were equally either mind-scratching or excellent. Nice but somewhat overpriced and thus empty cafe on the",
          "Beautiful modern building in the midst of a historic setting! Nice exposition in this very bright museum. Worth the visit before or after a nce walk",
          "Modern building close to the Melia Luxembourg Hotel. Beautiful building with beautiful and quiet sourrondings if you only want to take a walk.",
          "Great museum with constantly changing exhibitions. There's a cafe too. This is my favourite especially during the night of the museums. You can see some clips on youtube too.",
          "the building of MUDAM is a masterpiece itself. If you visit their on a sunny day, you will find the shadow and light beam into the inside of the museum and it is marvelous. There is some volunteers/trainees in the museum assisting visitors. Always talk to them and you will",
          "There is not a lot of good museum in Luxembourg and this one of them. The collection is really good and will find great temporary exhibitions! Even if you're crazy about modern art the place itself is a must-see for its particular architecture! Take also some time to walk",
          "The museum is situated in a very nice building and except for the usual paintings and photos there were a lot of bigger (and sometimes interctive) pieces of art. As students we didn't have to pay any entrance fee, but I think the usual prices are quite low. The museum shop",
          "If you like it, you should go there! Big, new and nice planned. Don't forget to find \"lovedeers\" monument near the museum",
          "Excellent space and selection of art! I particularly liked the light in the museum and how the space is organised. Nice museum shop as well.",
          "Set in a new area by the philarmonic, a bit of a hike and pain to get to and not in my opinion worth it...2 or 3 exhibits of some interest but the rest: pretty basic and uninspiring.",
          "I am not a fan of comtemporary art and know little about it. I was hesitant to spend our time here but my son (who lives in Luxembourg) thought it was very well-done and there would certainly be exhibits that my husband and I found would find interesting. I'm so glad we spent",
          "Huge and beautiful building almost empty. It is surrounded by an eerie setting of modern buildings made by concrete, steel and glass. Inside the museum you will find: rocks, blank canvases, photos of grass fields, electric bulbs and batteries in the floor. It seems like a",
          "MUDAM is an amazing place if you like modern architecture and to have a drink in an arty place after work (Wednesdays). I have been there many times hoping that the new exhibition would finally convince me. It had never happened. So let's say... don't go there if you want to",
          "what little there is to see gives pretentious a bad name. Nice building but needs some art, any kind of art, definintely better modern art.",

          "One of the few very interesting things to see/do in Luxembourg. The building is staggering - especially inside - it is woven between old ruins and sits next to some other large, impressive, glass buildings. The pieces inside are (as usual with Modern Art galleries) a mixture",
          "The building itself is very nice, the atmosphere insede is amazing. The exibitions are very great. I like a lot a gothic room inside the building, with some kind of windows made of X ray photos, really nice! The cafe is also very good and not expensive as usual a museum cafe",
          "Nice museum on Luxemburg Kirchberg. Modern art in amazing building. Exhibitions changes frequently. Lunch in restaurant is typical for this museum. Meeting point for young local people. Back to the town, take the walking downhill, with nice views on the town(1 hour)",
          "The building is spectacular and a must-see. I personally found the art a bit farfetched; if you like to look at pretty pictures this is not your museum. But still I recommend a visit, the bar is very nice and with good weather you have a nice view over the city.",
          "If you are under 25, you won't need to pay for it. It's nice to see some local artists, with movies and installations. It's nicer if you understand French, though.",
          "We ended up going to MUDAM on a very rainy and windy day. We loved the architecture (mixture of old and new), massive glass windows and extremely bright. The art collection was big enough, but as it always is with the contemporary art, you have to make your own judgement. We",
          "It's a bit too easy to pretend one knows that the exhibitions in a museum are not interesting when oneself has problems to like or understand it. I personally think the Mudam its worth join to visit because the choice of the exhibitions is eclectic enough and always combining",
          "The two best things about Mudam are the spectacular views it affords from the Kirchberg across to the Ville Haut and down to the Grund, together with the interesting building design. The museum is supposedly about moden art, but the collections have such a narrow base and many",
          "The location of the Museum is perfect for snapping some nice pictures of the old, 17th century fortress, along with the very new and shiny architecture of the museum and the surrounding EU buildings. The collections range in style and presentation. I'm sure anybody will find",

        "wiki": "The Monument of Remembrance (French: Monument du souvenir), usually known by the nickname of the G\u00eblle Fra (Luxembourgish for 'Golden Lady'), is a war memorial in Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg.  It is dedicated to the thousands of Luxembourgers who volunteered for service in the armed forces of the Allied Powers during both World Wars and the Korean War.\nThe G\u00eblle Fra is situated in Constitution Square, in the Ville Haute quarter of central Luxembourg City.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe centrepiece of the monument is a 21-metre-tall granite obelisk.  Atop of the obelisk stands a gilded bronze statue representing Nike, goddess of victory, or \"Queen of Freedom\" (Friddenskinnigin in Luxembourgish), holding out a laurel wreath as if placing it upon the head of the nation. At the foot of the obelisk are two (ungilded) bronze figures, representing those Luxembourgish soldiers that volunteered to serve for France; one lies at the base of the statue, having died in service of his country, whilst the other sits, mourning his dead compatriot.\nThe sculptor of the three bronze figures was Claus Cito, a native Luxembourger.  The model for the G\u00eblle Fra is unknown. The monument was inaugurated in 1923.\n\nThe inscriptions at the base of the monument include one in French, over the name of Foch, Marshal of France, Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces, that honours the Luxembourgeois soldiers who took part in the 1914-18 war, on the battlefields of the Marne, the Aisne and the Somme, and in Artois, Champagne and at Verdun.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nDuring the First World War, Luxembourg pledged itself to neutrality, but was occupied by Germany, which justified its actions by citing military necessity.  However, most Luxembourgers did not believe Germany's good intentions, fearing that Germany would annex their country in the event of a German victory; these claims were substantiated by Bethmann Hollweg's Septemberprogramm.Although Luxembourgers left under German occupation at home could do little to aid the Allies, those overseas, outside Germany's control, could volunteer to serve against Germany.  In total, 3,700 Luxembourgian nationals served in the French army, of whom, 2,000 died.  As Luxembourg's pre-war population was only 266,000, this death toll amounted to more than 1% of the entire national population, which is a relatively greater percentage than many combatant nations (see: World War I casualties).\nThe monument aroused public controversy at the time it was proposed and installed. Opposition had come from the conservative Catholic majority of citizens, and at the inauguration ceremony Grand Duchess Charlotte and the Bishop of Luxembourg were absent.\n\n\n=== World War II and after ===\nWhen Luxembourg was occupied by Nazi forces in World War II, the Germans dismantled the memorial on 21 October 1940. Several portions of the memorial were rescued, and after the war, the monument was partially restored. The G\u00eblle Fra herself however remained unaccounted for until January 1980 when she was found hidden beneath the main stand of the national football stadium. Later additions were made to honor Luxembourger forces who had served in World War II and the Korean War.\n\nThe monument was not fully reconstructed and restored to its original design until 1984 and then finally unveiled to the public in the presence of Grand Duke Jean on 23 June 1985, Luxembourg's national holiday.\nThe statue of the gilded lady was removed from the obelisk and exhibited at the entrance of the Luxembourg pavilion of the Expo 2010 world exhibition in Shanghai.\n\n\n== \"G\u00eblle Fra 2\" ==\nIn 2001, a controversial version of the monument, showing the statue as visibly pregnant and with a different inscription, was created by Sanja Ivekovi\u0107 and erected nearby.  Named as \"Lady Rosa of Luxembourg\", it is now in Luxembourg's Museum of Modern Art.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n Media related to G\u00eblle Fra at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n== References ==\n(in French and German) German occupation of Luxembourg.

        "wiki": "Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial is a Second World War American military war grave cemetery, located in Hamm, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg. The cemetery, containing 5,073 American war dead, covers 50.5 acres (20.4 ha) and was dedicated in 1960. It is administered by the American Battle Monuments Commission.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe cemetery was established on 29 December 1944 by the 609th Quartermaster Company of the U.S. Third Army while Allied Forces were containing the German Ardennes offensive in the winter of 1944/1945. General George S. Patton used the city of Luxembourg as headquarters. \n\n\n== Layout ==\nThe new headstones were cemented onto concrete beams that run for more than six miles under the lawn of the grave plots. The 5,076 headstones are set in nine plots of fine grass, lettered A to I. Separating the plots are two malls radiating from the memorial and two transverse paths.  Two flagpoles overlook the graves area. Situated between the two flagpoles lies the grave of General George S. Patton. Twenty-two sets of brothers rest side-by-side in adjacent graves. During the 1950s, the original wooden grave markers were replaced with headstones made of white Lasa marble. \nNot far from the cemetery entrance stands the white stone chapel, set on a wide circular platform surrounded by woods. It is embellished with sculpture in bronze and stone, a stained-glass window with the insignia of the five major U.S. commands that operated in the region, and a mosaic ceiling.\nUnder a U.S.-Luxembourg treaty signed in 1951 the U.S. government was granted free use in perpetuity of the land covered by the cemetery, without taxation.\n\n\n== Notable burials ==\nGeorge S. Patton, US general\nDay G. Turner, Medal of Honor recipient, Section E, 10-72\nWilliam D. McGee, Medal of Honor recipient, Section C, 7-13\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSledge, Michael (2005).

          "We were stunned at how beautiful this place was. It's maintained to a very high standard and rightly so. We walked through the gravestones and it was so sad to see how many lost their lives and some on xmas day. Coincidentally the bells in the tower tolled on the hour which",
          "Incredible experience. Glad we went. Spent 1 hr. It's sobering to look at the sacrifices made by young men in the prime of their life. We were looking for a friend's grand-uncle who was buried there. The site is beautifully laid out and maintained. Took a taxi from the hotel",
          "a short drive from Luxembourg city finds us at a site where 5K+ young men are interred, along with General Patton. It is a somber place, especially when you consider how young the men were. It would serve us well to remember the sacrifices others made on our behalf. Recommended",
          "The minute you step through the guarded gates of this hallowed ground you feel awe struck by the precision lines and cleanliness and then the feeling of peace and calm. The grass is so perfect I thought it couldn\u2019t be real until I touched it. We spent 2hours absorbing the",
          "It\u2019s a very peaceful and beautiful place. It reminds of the sacrifices of thousands of soldiers and fills you with gratitude. Must visit place in Luxembourg.",
          "This was our fourth visit to Luxembourg American Cemetery to visit my husband's cousin, PFC James Privoznik who was KIA during the Battle of the Bulge. He told his mother, that if he was killed, he wanted to be buried where he fell. And so he is. And what a beautiful and",
          "I didn\u2019t expect to find this memorial as an interesting \u201csightseeing\u201d part of our tour, but the experience is very humbling. The monument and stone crosses/stars that designate fallen soldiers - heroes - are beautifully designed. The cemetery is well kept and there is",
          "Friendly staff and a great place to learn about history of the region. Make sure to check it out! Highly recommend.",
          "We went to the Luxembourg American Cemetery on our Beyond Band of Brothers tour with ProCom. We were honored to be selected to present the wreath at the Memorial that day. There were few veterans on our tour, but all of us were overwhelmed by the beauty and solemnity of this",
          "We take all of our visitors here to pay our respects. It is a beautiful cemetery especially in the Spring and summer. It\u2019s amazing to think General Patton is buried so close to where we live.",
          "My Dad served under Patton in WWII and loved him. Patton, born to wealthy family, had a family burial plot in his native California, but spurned it to be buried with his men at this cemetery. To stand behind Patton's cross and look out at about 5,000 crosses of men who died in",
          "Incredibly moving walking around here. There are the graves or vasts soldiers, including some from Easy Company, 101st Airborne as well as Medal of Honour Recipitents. very respectful, and impressive to see Patton's grave, buried with his men.",
          "Visited this cemetery whilst on a city break trip to Luxembourg, when I was there at the end of Jan the cemetery was covered in a blanket of snow, which made it even more poignant as thats what it would have been like during the actual battle, 5,076 white crosses in neat rows",
          "There is a scavenger hunt for the young ones that allows everyone to enjoy the cemetary. Well kept gem.",
          "An important piece of Luxmbourg\u2019s history, preserved with great dignity. Most of the soldiers buried there lost their lives fighting for the liberation of Europe from Nazi Germany in the last few weeks of WWII.",
          "Very beautiful place memorializing those who sacrificed everything for our country and freedom. All those who are nearby should visit.",
          "This place has a soulless feel to it. Well kept but you don't get much of an experience. The German cemetery, half a mile away, gives you a much more emotional experience, and is full of interest.",
          "Came here to see the grave of Patton, but in the end saw much more. The cemetery is take care of perfectly.",
          "I am not American, so there's no emotional connection with this place for me, but I think it was worth a trip (the place is like 20 minutes by bus +15 minutes walking from the centre). I was there at the morning in the middle of the week, so I was litereally the only person",
          "Cemetry of the American soldiers who fought for the freedom of Europe. Includes General Patton's grave. Visit to realise the waste of war and pay your respects. German cementry nearby also worth visiting for a contrast.",
          "Just an update on getting there by public transport. The bus stop is behind the railway station - go over the walkway bridge across the tracks and then turn left, the bus number 15 stops at this bus stop, the Mecure Hotel no longer exists but the rest of the directions are",
          "If you go to Luxembourg it\u2019s a must see. Locals maintain this site and it is immaculate. Service animals not allowed\u2014 they will personally escort you. A guard told me there will be no dogs defecating on this sacred site. They stopped a jogger as soon as he entered. General",
          "This cemetery was the first American memorial I visited outside of the USA, and I must say that you can feel the honor and respect for these people while visiting. The chapel is very well kept and there are huge walls on either side of the entrance explaining what happened in",
          "This was great to see. The tour guides were very knowledgeable and gave us an individual tour to see my boyfriend\u2019s family member who was buried there. They even sent him home with a history packet of facts about his family member. The grounds are beautiful and it was very",
          "We came to Luxemburg to see this cemetery specifically. It was a large cemetery dedicated to the American soldiers that fought to protect the area from the Germans. Really cool",
          "My wife was present at the Cemetery dedication in the fifties as a child when she lived in France. For the first time in all these years, we felt the strong need to return to visit the cemetery and General Patton's grave. The finely manicured landscape, the beautiful memorial,",
          "So much history in this cemetery! The visitors center has pictures and some stories about the people buried here. Of course, this is General Patton\u2019s final resting place, so that was very neat to see.",
          "We had a very informative tour here in September. The tour was given by the director of the memorial site. The cemetery is the final resting place of over 5,000 soldiers , many who were killed in the Battle of the Bukge. It is also the burial site of General George Patton.",
          "The American Cemetery is a moving monument to the brave men that lost their lives in WWII. They grounds are meticulously maintained.",
          "If it would be possible to use the term \u201cbeautiful\u201d for a cemetery , than yes use it here. A visit of this place , remarkable by its architecture and how well it is maintained , is a must for anyone interested in history of Second World War .",
          "September 7, 2018 - As part of a group of 40 travelers, we stopped at the Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial to pay our respects to those who died to preserve our freedom. We actually had a WWII veteran in our group and he served as a tail gunner during the Battle of the",
          "This memorial is seriously moving. The area is perfectly kept up and a huge honor to the courage of the time",

          "This is a nice stop. Granted it's a cemetery, but they have done a wonderful job of presenting a lot of information here. The grounds are well kept, there is plenty of parking, informative displays, a nice visitor center, clean bathrooms, a nice small chapel to worship and",
          "Was the first place we visited when in Luxembourg. We took the bus there from the centre of town and walked the long path next too the woods where battles took place. We were struck by the sheer number of tombstones there and it was very moving, the grounds were beautifully",
          "A very moving experience to visit the resting place of thousands of young American men who died during WWII. It is a beautifully maintained memorial. Plan on taking an hour to two to take it all in. Stop in the visitor center to learn the back ground of some of the men buried",
          "This American military cemetery is absolutely beautiful and spiritual. We were there at closing as they lowered the flag and played taps. We spent about 1.5 hours there and felt uplifted and proud of America.",
          "Where the boys not men who fought and died of the \"Battle of the Bulge\" by a grate government. Still lovingly care fore by the peoples they freed all American should visit these sleeping warriors as they await that last bugle call. Command by General General Patton looking over",
          "If you are in Luxemburg and you are interested in the Second World War history don\u2019t miss it. Very emotional too.",
          "A solemn reminder of the sacrifices made. Don't miss Patton's grave (near the front). Its about 15 minutes outside of town and worth a trip out",
          "If you are spending two days in Luxembourg, then it\u00b4s worth to take half the afternoon to visit this cemetery. It will help you understand recent European history and have some quality introspective time of reflexi\u00f3n. To complete the excursi\u00f3n, try to visit the German cemetery",
          "If you visit this place, visit also the German one situated rather close! It is only a few minutes drive away!",
          "This cemetery is immaculately maintained and beautiful. Patton\u2019s grave is near the front, but it\u2019s worth walking through the rows to acknowledge the sacrifices of the 5000 dead.",
          "Only one word can describe this ... RESPECT! Great appreciation to all who maintains this cemetery...",
          "Been willing to visit this place for several years already but it seems impossible to reach it through public transport. Finally had a chance to visit it by car. Impressive place to see. Everything is kept perfectly in order. Seeing all those white crosses perfectly aligned",
          "Just go. Respect the men and woman who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Well laid out park. Well maintained, tastefully done. Visitor center is small but helpful. Thirty minutes of your day you won\u2019t forget.",

          "A very well keep Memorial to all of the soldiers that gave their lives so that we can enjoy our freedom. The cemetery is a true fitting resting stop. The cemetery, which is 50.5 acres in extent contains the remains of 5,076 American service members.",
          "The amount of respect paid and attention to keeping this memorial to US soldiers in pristine condition is beyond belief. I honestly did not know what to expect but seeing this gives me so more respect for the LUX government and people for honoring our fallen. It\u2019s like a mini",
          "It is impressive. It is a must seen place when visiting Luxembourg city. Already from the gates you can see that this is an American cemetary. When you step in, you feel you were teleported to USA. It is well maintained and you can learn about the history there. Free parking and",
          "Visited the burial ground on my own, made the experience even more emotional. The idea of so many young lives lost gives you the chills. The great general Patton among his troops. Highly recommended if in Luxembourg and have some spare time on your hands.",
          "It was on September 11th, when we had the great privilege to visit this cemetery where Americans known & unknown, lost their lives for our freedom. They served in the Army & Airforce. This Cemetary is honored ground that is beautifully maintained & respected. Monuments are",

          "Stumbled upon this cemetery on Memorial Day, and witnessed a lovely ceremony. A smaller version of Arlington National Cemetery, in VA., this European memorial invokes similar sentiments.",
          "So pleased to see that all those young American soldiers are remembered and revered for their sacrifice. We owe our current way of life and freedom to these young men and their comrades. The people of Luxembourg will never forget their efforts, nor should we. I visited the site",
          "It is difficult to recommend a visit to a cemetery, but if you are in Luxembourg you really should spend a few hours here and remember the sacrifice that these guys made for us. Lest we forget",
          "Cannot really express how much emotion welled up visiting the graves of so many young men who gave their all - REAL sacrifice. Our 87 year old guide, Rene, was in attendance as a Boy Scout to General Patton\u2019s funeral procession. A must see for all.",
          "We visited in July on our bus ride to Paris. It was an emotional visit to all of us in the group. Saw where George Patton was buried. The gardens surrounding is kept very clean & well maintained. Nice visitor center & clean rest rooms. Spent an hour here & was well worth",
          "It is about 15 minutes from downtown Luxembourg city and I hear you can take a bus on most days, but since I only had time on Sunday I had to hire a taxi. I recommend 30 minutes of walking around looking at the place. It could be longer if you want to take your time and do",
          "I visited here more than 50 years ago as a child and clearly remember the impact it made on me so of course it was a must for us to visit again. The artistry of the landscape is breathtaking, the uniformity and symmetry amazing. How can the death of so many young men, so many",
          "It's inspiring and will tear at your heart; beautifully maintained, interesting outdoor exhibits in addition to the graves; burial place for George S. Patton and thousands of other American GIs; nice restrooms and visitor center; fabulous photo ops; it will inspire silence and",
          "When you see all the crosses in the cemetery it really puts it all in perspective, we weren't sure whether to visit but found the whole setup moving and inspired. Very well maintained, considering its pretty far out from the centre of Luxembourg.",
          "A reminder of American sacrifices in war. The cemetery consists of 50.5 acres in a wooded Glade in the countryside. The graves area contains the remains of 5076 American military Dead,including one woman,an Army nurse and 101 headstones marking the graves of unknowns. A",
          "We were able to get a personal tour of the cemetery and an explanation of not only the Battle of the Bulge but some of the history leading up to the battle and subsequent invasion of Germany (this tour may not be available to individuals but may be to groups). We also visited",
          "Around 6000 Americans who are lying here have served the army and made sure we can live in peace. Very impressed by this place how it is setup. Clean, quiet, respectful. You will be impressed!",
          "All Americans on tour should go see this. It is a very moving experience. It makes you think about our forefathers and what our countries went through and why......freedom.",
          "This place is a nice place to go for example during a sunday afternoon. Its a well taken place and it has some very huge and impressive monuments at the area. There are many totally white crosses and general Patton's own grave. He is buried there with his troops. Its a place",
          "It is very impressive to see al those graves. It is a beautiful peacefull place, We should never forget how many gave their lives for a free world. We must never stop honouring them and paying our respect on war cemeteries like these. In a war cemetery in Thailand it was",
          "An important stop for anyone following world history. This is the final resting place for about 4,000 Americans who died in WWII -- including the grave of General Patton (although he died after the war). Meticulous landscaping and maintenance, and several very informative",
          "If you are in Luxembourg, do not miss seeing the American Cemetery Memorial. There is a wall with the names of the missing soldiers, as well as a beautiful little chapel. Take time to walk around and look at some of the names on the graves, too. General Patton is also buried",
          "I stopped here on part of my \"Band of Brothers\" tour. 5 of the members of Easy Company are interred here. The brochures at the office give locations. Also, Gen. Patton is here. Two giant walls give overview maps of WWII in Europe and more localized battles.",
          "Very beautiful kept cemetry which makes you silent and respectful to all those soldiers who rest here, and saw their lives end too young.",
          "This is a great example of a United States military cemetery. It inspires all Americans as it reminds us of the sacrifices made by our young men and women in the cause for freedom. It is the burial site for General George Patton. Beautifully maintained as expected. Great",
          "The US cemetary in Luxembourg commemorates the soldiers who fell in WW2. We recommend that American visitors pay their respects. Much appreciated and different to Mardasson in Bastigne",
          "Really beautiful cemetery, wide and well guarded. With interesting walls explaining the war locally. Just near the German one which is in a total different style. Nice free and wide parking just in front of it. Easy access . Also a possible walk from there in the fields and",
          "One of the best sceneries in Luxembourg city. Good start of the corniche walk or to walk down to Clausen.",
          "Spent an hour going through and photographing the graves of 34 soldiers from RI. Very moving to remember those from my home state. Took the bus, then walked to the German cemetery afterwards.",
          "It is not really true to say that \"if you have seen one American military cemetery you have seen them all\". Despite the fact that the lay out may be similar, they all have their special histories and the environment is different at all the once I have seen. This one is small in",
          "Visiting here gives the same emotion and humbling experience as going to the Omaha Beach Cemetery only without having to drive 6 hours. It\u2019s about 1.5 hours from Kaiserslautern/Ramstein. Smaller, obviously, but GEN Patton is buried here as well as some of the Band of Brothers.",
          "It is surprising how different the feeling is to see these memorials to do many lives lost up close. The effect is far greater than seeing film of the rows and rows of monuments to those who have their lives.",
          "A place to remember, I've been here 5 times and every visit has been unique. Thousands and thousanda of stories in such a small place.",
          "No words can describe this Cemetery Memorial. More than 5 000 graves of US Soldiers. As a French guy, I just want to say : Thanks & God Bless America!",

          "A must see while in Luxembourg. Beautiful grounds which are well kept. A map is provided to walk around.",
          "I really recommend this place if you are interested in visiting some memorials regarding II World War.",
          "I went here with low expectations but was surprised at how impressive this site was. It is incredibly well maintained. It is a humbling experience and should be combined with a visit to the German war memorial which is a couple minutes drive away. Sad to see all these young",
          "Amazingly well kept American cemetery. Upon entering the gates there is a visitors center (which unfortunately I did not visit), a chapel and two monuments which give an overview of US involvement in WWII. The cemetery slopes a bit away from this area and General George Patton",
          "All the Americans killed in Luxembourg are buried here. And so is general Patton. Buried with his men. It\u2019s worth a visit somber and special",
          "Loved the history here and the breath of America. I had no idea Patton was buried in Lux. The place is immaculate, just plan for a shirt visit since there is not much to see. We cabbed here and asked our cab driver to stay while we toured. I would recommend that if you do not",
          "As usual with US Military cemeteries, this place is immaculately maintained. It has good parking but is also accessible from City Centre via #15 bus to Hamm and a 3/4 mile walk. The German Cemetery is nearby and worth a visit.",
          "A fitting memorial to the sacrifice of so many for all of us. Any visitor will be very moved by this site, children included. The plaques provide an excellent overview of World War II and all that was done to preserve our freedom and way of life. The sacrifice made by those",

          "Probably the largest US military cemetery in the region - hundreds of crosses and Jewish stars of David. A humbling experience.",
          "The history of this region is survival through thousands of years of bloodshed upon the land surrounding land. This cemetery commemorates the sacrifices of American soldiers during the Battle of bulge in WWII as well as some soldiers from WWI. A quiet and informing space with",
          "Very moving experience. The sacrifices of the soldiers who gave their lives to battle the Nazis is so evident. So incredible to see Patton's grave and the graves of all his fallen soldiers.",
          "We visited the memorial as part of a river cruise. It was one of our favorite destinations. The simple crosses and stars of those who lost their lives at the Battle of the Bulge left a moving and memorable image in our minds. General Patton\u2019s grave is there, as he wanted to",
          "Our 16 yr old grandson wasn't too thrilled about going here, but we wanted to. Very glad we did. He was glad, too once we got there. We arrived at 9 am just as the gates were opening and beat all the tour bus people into the cemetery. At this hour of the morning, it was a very",
          "Been here serveral times, the site makes you think about how senseless war is. Good information section as well. People should visit here to pay their respects, and the German cemetery too.",
          "I've been to Arlington, Normandy, and now this one. Beautiful place to reflect and pain your respect. A group of scouts from England I believe were there scrubbing the headstones while we were there. It's kind of a pain to get to, so please don't make the same mistake we did",
          "Approaching the front gates of the Cemetery, one is immediately filled with awe and a realization that herein lie the remains of soldiers who gave their lives during WWII to protect and save the Constitution of the USA and our democracy. Rows of crosses and Stars of David bear",
          "This is a World War II cemetery which holds the body of General George Patton along with thousands of Christian and Jewish soldiers who gave their life for their county, the United States. This is truly an experience not to miss in this area. It is probably the #1 sight in",
          "This area is beautiful. General Patton is buried in Secion P, grave 1. Interesting story on his placement up front. All other cemeteries everyone is equal in death...rank does not have any privileges. But since he was the 3rd Army commander, and most of the graves are his",
          "This military cemetery like others we visited in France and Belgium is a reminder of the huge loss of life suffered during World War II. I did not realise that General Patton is also buried here. There is also a nice Visitor's Center and small cafe.",
          "This was our fourth visit to Luxembourg American Cemetery to visit the grave of my husband's cousin, Pvt. James Privoznik who was killed in the Battle of the Bulge and was part of Patton's 3rd Army. This time was very special because we had our daughter and grandchildren with",
          "On our last day, we could not get public transport to our chosen castle, so we came here instead. Although we had both visited many Military Cemetery's this one was still awesome in it's ability to make you reflect. Although we took a taxi there, we walked all the way back to",
          "The burial site of over 5000 American soldiers including Gen. George Patton. A War Memorial, which includes a small interior chapel is just inside the entrance as is an imposing carved wall listing the names of those whose bodies were never discovered and other walls displaying",
          "An emotional experience to actually see all the grave sites of the people who gave their lives for our freedom. I didn\u2019t realize Patton was buried here. I\u2019ve read so many books on the War. This brought the reality to all I\u2019ve read. A thank you to the men and women who gave up",
          "It was painful to get to the cemetery by public transportation but well worth it. It is clearly maintained with love and respect.",
          "I've visited most of the foreign US military cemeteries and Luxembourg is right up there for significance. If you're interested in Patton, MOH, or finding some of the Band of Brothers they do a good job mapping it out at the visitor center. It's really hard to put into words",
          "This military cemetery is another reminder of the tremendous loss of life during World War II. As you walk around and look at the graves and notice the ages of these men and how very young many of them were who fought in the Battle of the Bugle. Although he did not die until",
          "At the end of our time in Luxembourg, on the way to the airport, we stopped for a short visit to this stirring place. It happened to be Memorial Day back in the US so it was an even better experience to be able to honor so many who fell in the few months toward the end of",
          "We visited here for Memorial Day. As soon as you enter the cemetery and see the American flag flying at half staff the tears begin. To see this is such a moving, powerful experience every school child in America should learn about the sacrifices these men made. Be sure to visit",
          "We stopped here on our way to Paris as part of our Viking River Cruise experience and I'm ever so grateful we were able to visit here. The grounds are immaculate and whoever planned this memorial did an excellent job. It was hard to comprehend that the 5,000 men and women who",
          "General George Patton and more than 5,000 of his men are buried in the American Military Cemetery And Memorial on the outskirts of Luxembourg city. From the moment a visitor passes beneath the blue and gold-trimmed wrought iron gate, he or she begins to feel the presence of the",
          "This is a must see place for every American passing through Luxembourg. It is a very respectful tribute to these American soldiers who never made it home from WW II. I would describe this best as an oversees miniature Arlington. This is an important stop for all ages. Just a",
          "Called in as visiting Luxembourg City. Have a number of family and friends who served/serving (UK and US) and wanted to pay our respects. The area is easily accessible with free parking. The grounds are beautifully kept and very peaceful. Well worth a visit.",
          "American cemetry there General Patton is burried. Very impressive cemetry due to its size of the numbers of USA soldiers that have a memory cross here but also of its geometric allignment of these crosses and the way it is maintained. Everything is so clean and well maintained",
          "The beauty of this place is just amazing, and it is a must see place for any U.S. citizen and former and present service member to pay respect respect to these heroes that gave it all. I drove to the cemetery from my hotel and it took less than ten minutes to get there. I was",
          "Went to see General Patton's Grave, but the whole cemetery is a very moving experience, nearby is the German cemetery, a totally different place.",
          "I\u2019ve been to many Military Cemeteries, including Arlington, Leavenworth and others. Luxembourg beats them all for quality - they have done a perfect job. Every blade of grass is green, every hedge perfectly manicured and every structure immaculately clean. Yet nothing is over",
          "This cemetery in Luxembourg is a beautiful tribute to the many thousands of American soldiers that fought for the freedom of Luxembourg at the Battle of the Bulge. The rows of crosses are hard to see, but very touching. The grave of General Patton is also here.",
          "This was a very touching and beautiful memorial to the Americans who lost their lives nearby in WW2. It\u2019s quite a ways out from the city centre, but well worth the bus journey and the short walk. It\u2019s beautiful and there is an information building with friendly staff and self",
          "Hello Its my second time to visit American cemetery but this one is bigger. Make completely different feelings then other cemetery specialy then British, Irish or Polish cemetery. Full respect to the place and RIP to the soldiers.",
          "This beautiful cemetery is actually administered by American Battle Monuments Commission. Over 5 thousands people are buried here. Among them victims of the battle of the Bulge. Between the two flagpoles lies General George Patton. This place is worth your while for a lot of",
          "My husband and I (he is in the Army stationed in Germany) came to Luxembourg exclusively to visit the American military cemetery and see Patton's grave. It was a beautifully sunny day when we visited. The cemetery is absolutely pristine and perfectly kept. The little chapel",
          "So it\u2019s a bus ride out of the city, 4 euros to a bus terminus that\u2019s not really.. it\u2019s on a business park so don\u2019t expect to get a coffee... then a 20 minute walk up to the cemetery... what a beautiful place they picked, it\u2019s quiet, serene and just spotless... a beautiful",
          "We arrived really early and there was an American caretaker in the grounds. We asked him when the gates opened and he said 9 but invited us into wait in the visitors room as it was raining. In here we signed the visitors books and read all the books and posters on the wall",
          "This cemetery/memorial was built for the american soldiers, who were killed during second world war. It\u2018s a place to think while youre walking through the graves and look at all this fallen soldiers. The man in die visitors office is very friendly and he can help you with all",
          "all cemeteries at serious. this one is filled with american boys who died on foreign soil. the graves are filled with men who were barely men. 18-22. pristine, beautiful grounds. i\u2019ve been 5 times.",
          "An historical place to see a great leader burried with his mens in a beautiful memorial to the American effort in WW II.",
          "This is a must see, in order to remind us of the many young men who gave their lives for our liberty!",
          "Easy to get to on the bus and with a short walk at the end (helpful to have google maps as reassurance). We were really glad to have visited the cemetery, it was very interesting and awe inspiring, It is also a very beautiful place. We thought it was very much worth the trip",
          "This was our second visit to the cemetery. My father served in the 3rd Division under the leadership of General Patton, who is buried here. My father was one of the lucky ones who made it home alive after the war. This cemetery absolutely took my breath away. I hope if you",
          "Well kept cemetery, General Patton is buried here. The German cemetery is just around the corner and you can clearly see who lost the war...... 5000 allied soldiers are buried here. Defenetly worth a visit but don't leave any kind of valuable items in the car, very often cars",
          "The Luxembourg American Cemetery is well known as the final resting place of General George S Patton, but this cemetery has over 5,000 burials of men who fell in the fighting on the Southern Flank of the Battle of the Bulge, and indeed were brought in from fighting in Germany",
          "My generation has not lived a war. Seeing a field of graves of mostly young men is much better history lesson any book can provide. Very interesting to visit and reflect upon",
          "I wanted to come to see Patton\u2019s burial site. A must for any WWII enthusiast or history buff. Getting here wasn\u2019t the quickest or easiest though. You have to go by bus (#15 is what I took) and at the K\u00e4schtewee stop you exit. From there it\u2019s a 10 minute or so walk. There are",
          "Very well maintained historical cemetery of Service members who died in the battles of WWII. Similar in style to the Arlington Cemetery, the immaculate grounds are all \u201cDress Right Dress\u201d. Two large scale historical maps outlining the battles of the war and peaceful chapel greet",
          "A short taxi ride of the way to or from the airport and well worth the detour or visit. Managed by American volunteers from the services. Well kept and a great tribute to those many thousands who lost their precious loves and lives during the first and second world wars in this",
          "We have visited the Luxembourg American Cemetery more than a few times. It is one of the places we always take visiting American friends. The cemetery is well maintained, and breath-taking if you have never seen a WWII cemetery. The highlight is visiting Patton's grave. I",
          "It is one of this places which sometimes should be visited by each of us. The cemetery let us think about the life and opportunities we have to make world a better place!",
          "Our beyond the Band of Brothers tour group stopped here. We were told to prepare for something special. We went through the Cemetery gate, we saw the memorial buildings and visitor center here and then were lead to General Patton's grave. The Surprise. All of the ww2 vets and",
          "As some of the others have mentioned, of course for us was an important site. It was impressive, somber, peaceful yet thought provoking! It's hard to rate is very good or excellent as it's not your usual tourist attraction but it was impressive and moments of reflection.",
          "Northern Luxembourg was a main location for the Battle of the Bulge, and while the cemetery is far from the battlefields, it is nevertheless an impressive historical monument.",
          "This place might be of interest if you are american and have some family members who died during World War II and are buried right here ! Otherwise , coming here will probably just be a waste of time...",
          "Unexpected huge cementery in the capital of Louxembourg. It is necessary to go by car. It is pure history of the second world war",
          "So many young men died to help protect the world from evil. There is an endless sea of white crosses along with General Patton's grave. A very fitting memorial and a reminder that freedom isn't free. May God bless all those who gave the ultimate sacrifice!",
          "A somber yet very beautiful place to commemorate those who gave their lives so that we may live in peace. Well kept and clean. Particularly worth a visit if you take interest in WWII.",
          "if you are American do not miss this place . If not you have better things to do , even in Luxembourg",
          "The dignity and sombreness of this place do not detract from its beauty. Well worth a visit--don't rush.",
          "Took our family on a WW II tour of Europe and spent some time in Luxembourg. The American Cemetery has historical information both about World War II, and more specifically, the Battle of the Bulge. You will get chills when you see all the crosses and Stars of David. Also,",
          "Driving would leave you right in front of the gate's parking lot. For taking the bus, Bus 15 goes from the side of the park in city center at Wampach. It was 2 euros to get on the bus, towards village of Hamm. The stop is Kaschtewee. Then follow the map directions in the",
          "Our Viking tour stopped here on our way to Luxembourg City and it was a highlight of our 14 day tour! This is where many fallen Americans from the Battle of the Bulge are laid to rest. Including General MacArthur. Our tour group was taken aback by the perfect setting, precise",
          "It\u2019s a nice memorial and cemetery for WWII veterans. General Patton is buried there. It is tasteful and well done. It is worth a visit. Parking is free also.",
          "If you are into WWII history this is a lovely calm and quiet place for remembrance. Well kept grounds full of peacefulness. The equivalent German cemetery just down the road is also worth the visit . The comparison is awesome.",
          "The memorial is located a bit further away from Luxemburg city, we reached it by car, I do not know how to reach it by public transport but I would recommend going there only if you have some connection or special interest in World War II, because there is not much to see except",
          "I really enjoyed visiting the memorial. Its simiplistic and very well maintained. Very sad but I would recommend it. My favourite part was the stories in the visitors centre, make sure you pop in. Fair warning, if you go by bus make sure you have Google maps, it's a little walk",
          "This was our second visit, as a stop on the way to Bastogne. Beautiful and so memorable. Great chance to teach the children about our history.",
          "So lucky that we got to see this beautiful place on Veterans Day! It was amazing to see! General Patton is buried there. The guide was awesome and if you have the chance take a guided tour because they show you all the spots you don\u2019t want to miss!",
          "Not much to say. If you are a sensitive person and the sacrifice of many means anything, spend few minutes in this cemetery and memorial site, near the town, just beside the airport.",
          "I would highly recommend a visit to this cemetery if you are in Luxembourg City. It is a bit of a pain to get to without a car (bus ride and then about a 15-18 minute walk), but it is well worth it. The cemetery itself quite moving and most of those buried there died during",
          "Very well designed and historical feelings behind . The environment and signalisation is clear and interesting to visit",
          "So glad we got out to see the American cemetery. Admission is free and you can get there by bus for 2 Euro/pp on Bus 15 from the heart of the City. You will have to walk about 10-15 minutes to the cemetery gates, however it is an easy and pretty walk. We did not have a guide,",
          "It's a short bus ride from the city center (bus is free on Saturdays, presumably Sundays too but not sure). The cemetery is well maintained. I went in early November and it was very pretty with the fall foliage. I was there at noon and walking among the crosses while the chapel",
          "Short visit. Manicured lawns. Impressive. Visitor center is small but well done. Interesting stories. Visit Gen. Patton's grave.",
          "Beautiful and moving memorial, we recommend to visit it together with the German Cemetery. Take a look at the personal stories in the visitor centre, it's worth it. Take the bus 15 from the city centre and walk about 15 in to get there. The distance between the 2 cemeteries is",
          "If you are near Luxembourg City, even if your an hour or more away, you need to visit this memorial. The US takes excellent care of these memorials in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Holland. This cemetery has Gen Patton buried here as well as 22 pairs of brothers. Just 1.5",
          "This is a small place where military warriors have been put to rest following the Battle of the Bulge. This 50 acres sight was dedicated in 1960 with 5076 burials and recognizing 371 names of those missing in action. The grounds are well keep, the grass is very green and",
          "worth to visit recommend to go first to the visitor centre where you get the details of some special graves, band of brothers, ... impressive crosses in white marble",
          "As a citizen of Luxembourg i visited the cemetery already a few times. It is always very sad for me to see this graves and the white crosses... we have to be thankful for the sacrifices that those men did for the freedom in Europe. As a tourist it is highly recommended to visit.",
          "Something worth seeing. It is deffinently something different, and normally not seen in Europe, but very good! Very nice and tidy.",
          "Only a short bus ride from the city (bus number 23). You then have to walk along a track through woodland to reach this amazing place. This walk certainly gives the atmosphere needed for contemplation and remembrance. The information centre is perfect. The cemetery itself is",
          "Beautifully laid out and maintained, this cemetary is the final resting place of thousands of US soldiers, most of which were fatalities of the Natzi's last stand in the Battle of the Bulge. The cemetary also displays large maps depicting this battle. General Patton is also",
          "I will tell you exactly how to get there, but first be prepared for a poignant and emotional visit. I thought it was a sacrifice for me to get to this memorial, but I wiped the feeling away immediately walking into the memorial. If you are not driving there, or on a tour, this",
          "This is my favourite place in the city. The cemetary is dedicated to about 5,000 American soldiers who gave their lives in WWII. Located outside the city of Luxembourg, the cemetary is not very well connected to the city by public transport, however you can easily reach by a",
          "We had spent the day in Verdun and the surrounding areas visiting WWI sites, and wanted to make sure to squeeze in a stop here before they closed for the day. My college-aged son is a big history buff so he wanted to see Patton's grave and the cemetery. We got there about 4pm,",
          "Beautifully kept grounds, and a beautiful monument. A sobering reminder of the horrors of war. General Pattons grave is at the head of his soldiers. A reminder of the battle of the bulge and in the Ardennes. Peaceful grounds away from the hustle and bustle of Luxembourg city.",
          "The atmosphere is really serious. So many heroes that have fight for your freedom. If you visit Luxembourg this is a must.",
          "I took my parents to visit and was very impressed with how beautiful and serene this place is, my father was very surprised to see General Patton buried here, worth a visit if visiting Luxembourg!",
          "We have been to the War cemetaries in Normandy. This was a moving experience somewhat different than Normandy. To see Pattons grave stone at the back of 5,000 headstones was profound although small, the visitor center was also moving.",
          "WE visited when it was pouring rain. We went to the visitor's center and they helped us attempt to locate a grave. (We were at the wrong cemetery.) We also read the story boards with information on some of the people buried here. It was inspiring and made you both proud and",
          "I\u2019ve been to many military cemetery\u2019s all over Europe. So I knew that coming to Luxembourg, I\u2019d have to come and pay my respects here. They never fail to shock and leave me speechless. Well worth a visit, they all are.",
          "As with all military cemeteries you want to salute and you want to cry. America left some of its' best and bravest here. You will find diagrams of the battles these men (and 1 woman) fought. As far as I know officers are burried in the same rows as enlisted. Here there is 1",
          "I've never been one for historical places or history for that matter but I've always admired how the Americans honour their soldiers and those who fought for their country, they have so much respect for them. My husband wanted to visit here whilst driving throughout Europe so I",
          "This was very overwhelming and excellent if your into history. don't forget to visit the only women in the cemetery. Nancy J Leo . she was a nurse. we took the number 20 bus and walked from like a industrial estate.. its well sign posted. maybe 10-15 min walk from bus stop",
          "We got a bus 20 from town and followed the signs, which was nice. when you arrive make sure you pop into the visitor centre (we skipped it and regretted it) it explains a lot about the place and were the graves are for certain people (band of brothers and the only woman). There",
          "The American Cemetery Memorial is a quiet green place. If you have some extra time in Luxembourg it is definitely worth visiting. You can get there by bus number 15. You get off at bus stop K\u00e4schtewee if I am not mistaken. (I was informed that buses are for free on all",
          "I cannot go to Luxembourg without visiting and paying my respects to Gen. George S. Patton and the thousands of American soldiers who gave their lives in defense of our country during World War II. Several Medal of Honor winners are also buried in this holy place. The cemetery",
          "It is a very peaceful place where also general Patton is burried. It's goed That People are still aware of what all these, often young, soldiers did for our future...",
          "It's worth the stop. It's nicely maintained with several large displays of the European campaign. Gen. Patton's grave is at the front, not in a row with the other soldiers.",
          "For those who visit Luxembourg the cemetary is a must see . It is located not far from the airport , plenty of free parking ,free entrance and helpful employees at the entrnace house. Neatly upkept and a fantastic memorial to all those who participated in the war .",
          "The Battle of the Bulge, George S. Patton - this place saw some history. I'm so glad I'd read a review that suggested (urged) seeing both the American and German cemeteries while you're in the area - the difference between the two spoke more than seeing either alone could",
          "The place has a certain calm and quiet to it. Definitely steeped in history and contains stories of the World War and its ravages. A must visit.",
          "Worth a visit. Also go to the German military cemetery nearby, in part to contrast this gleaming, white, triumphal cemetery with the shady, green, dark, and rather melancholy German one. I took public transportation to get here, which wasn't too hard. I had to walk to the German",
          "My son Chris mentioned that we could go over to the Luxembourg American Cemetery since it was only about 50 miles away from Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany. It was a good warm day in October with a blue sky and no clouds perfect. This is were General George S. Patton is interned",
          "I have been living in Luxembourg for quite some time and i go here sometimes to find peace and quietness and to be reminded of the sacrifices that young men did in WW2. The place is very well well kept up and clean.",
          "A really sobering reminder of the result of the war, but worth a visit with lots of great information and friendly staff",
          "This huge and carefully laid out cemetery with all the names of those that needlessly lost their lives serves as a reminder that war is never appropriate",

          "I had to stop by and visit the military cemetery in Luxembourg. I'd been here before but this time around with my children. I have to say this is one of the least entertaining attractions a person could bring his children to, but I wanted for them to grasp the idea of everything",
          "Beautiful memorial to soldiers who gave their lives at the Battle of the Bulge. Tasteful, reverent, peaceful.",
          "We caught the bus to the stop that is 1 mile away and it was quite a nice stroll to the cemetery no problem for our 3 children age 4,7,9. Also quite fun as by the rail line so they got to see trains and also watch the plans landing at the airport. The cemetery is so well kept",
          "Not only is walking into the cemetery jaw-dropping but the place, beautifully kept as it is, makes you remember that a lot of people fought for generations of humans to be able to live a peaceful life. You don't have to be American to appreciate this beautiful place. A must",

          "Just a short drive from the centre of Luxembourg lies this cemetery and memorial. It is immaculately kept and although quite a sombre place also very thought provoking. The chapel is tiny but beautiful and you may lift the ropes to take a seat should you wish to pray or spent a",
          "The Luxembourg American Cemetery is a short drive from central Luxembourg City and well worth a visit. You enter through impressive gates and there is a small, unstaffed visitors centre where you can pick up a cemetery guide or relax on some of the comfortable sofa and chairs.",
          "A beautifully kept memorial to the fallen US soldiers. Pattons grave is here looking out over his men. You can't help but be moved by the amount of white crosses lay before you once you enter the grounds. The grounds are kept immaculate by the grounds staff and are a credit to",

          "We read about it, number of crosses and Stars, etc... but seeing it in front of us, all those crosses and Stars lined up covering the field. What a humbling experience. Some in unmarked graves, some died on my birthdate (month and day not year), all ranks, it makes you think",
          "My visit to this cemetery was a somber experience as one reflects on the sacrifice so few put forth for so many. The cemetery has maps that show the progress of the war. You can also see the grave of General Patton, it is located in the front of the cemetery,",
          "I visited while touring many WW2 sites in the Battle of the Bulge region. Standing among the seemingly endless graves is incredibly emotional. Also carved are the names of the missing. The whole area is an excellent tribute to these brave individuals who will never return home.",

        "wiki": "Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: L\u00ebtzebuerg, French: Luxembourg, German: Luxemburg), also known as Luxembourg City (Luxembourgish: Stad L\u00ebtzebuerg or d'Stad, French: Ville de Luxembourg, German: Stadt Luxemburg, Luxemburg-Stadt), is the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the country's most populous commune. Standing at the confluence of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers in southern Luxembourg, the city lies at the heart of Western Europe, situated 213 km (132 mi) by road from Brussels, 372 km (231 mi) from Paris, and 209 km (130 mi) from Cologne. The city contains Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.\nAs of 31 December 2019, Luxembourg City has a population of 122,273 inhabitants, which is more than three times the population of the country's second most populous commune (Esch-sur-Alzette). The city's population consists of 160 nationalities. Foreigners represent 70% of the city's population, while Luxembourgers represent 30% of the population, and the number of foreign-born residents in the city rises steadily each year.In 2011, Luxembourg was ranked as having the second-highest per capita GDP in the world at $80,119 (PPP), with the city having developed into a banking and administrative centre. In the 2011 Mercer worldwide survey of 221 cities, Luxembourg was placed first for personal safety, while it was ranked 19th for quality of living.Luxembourg is one of the de facto capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg), as it is the seat of several institutions, agencies, and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, and Eurostat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Roman era, a fortified tower guarded the crossing of two Roman roads that met at the site of Luxembourg city. Through an exchange treaty with the abbey of Saint Maximin in Trier in 963, Siegfried I of the Ardennes, a close relative of King Louis II of France and Emperor Otto the Great, acquired the feudal lands of Luxembourg. Siegfried built his castle, named Lucilinburhuc (\"small castle\"), on the Bock Fiels (\"rock\"), mentioned for the first time in the aforementioned exchange treaty.\nIn 987, Archbishop Egbert of Trier consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael's Church). At a Roman road intersection near the church, a marketplace appeared around which the city developed.\nThe city, because of its location and natural geography, has through history been a place of strategic military significance. The first fortifications were built as early as the 10th century. By the end of the 12th century, as the city expanded westward around the new St. Nicholas Church (today the Cathedral of Notre Dame), new walls were built that included an area of 5 hectares (12 acres). In about 1340, under the reign of John the Blind, new fortifications were built that stood until 1867.\nIn 1443, the Burgundians under Philip the Good conquered Luxembourg. Luxembourg became part of the Burgundian, and later Spanish and Austrian empires (See Spanish Netherlands and Spanish Road) and under those Habsburg administrations Luxembourg Castle was repeatedly strengthened so that by the 16th century, Luxembourg itself was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. Subsequently, the Burgundians, the Spanish, the French, the Spanish again, the Austrians, the French again, and the Prussians conquered Luxembourg.\nIn the 17th century, the first casemates were built; initially, Spain built 23 km (14 mi) of tunnels, starting in 1644. These were then enlarged under French rule by Marshal Vauban, and augmented again under Austrian rule in the 1730s and 1740s.\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, the city was occupied by France twice: once, briefly, in 1792\u20133, and, later, after a seven-month siege. Luxembourg held out for so long under the French siege that French politician and military engineer Lazare Carnot called Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city's nickname: the 'Gibraltar of the North'.Nonetheless, the Austrian garrison eventually surrendered, and as a consequence, Luxembourg was annexed by the French Republic, becoming part of the d\u00e9partement of For\u00eats, with Luxembourg City as its pr\u00e9fecture. Under the 1815 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars, Luxembourg City was placed under Prussian military control as a part of the German Confederation, although sovereignty passed to the House of Orange-Nassau, in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis, the 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg to dismantle the fortifications in Luxembourg City. Their demolition took sixteen years, cost 1.5 million gold francs, and required the destruction of over 24 km (15 mi) of underground defences and 4 hectares (9.9 acres) of casemates, batteries, barracks, etc. Furthermore, the Prussian garrison was to be withdrawn.\n\nWhen, in 1890, Grand Duke William III died without any male heirs, the Grand Duchy passed out of Dutch hands, and into an independent line under Grand Duke Adolphe. Thus, Luxembourg, which had hitherto been independent in theory only, became a truly independent country, and Luxembourg City regained some of the importance that it had lost in 1867 by becoming the capital of a fully independent state.\nDespite Luxembourg's best efforts to remain neutral in the First World War, it was occupied by Germany on 2 August 1914. On 30 August, Helmuth von Moltke moved his headquarters to Luxembourg City, closer to his armies in France in preparation for a swift victory. However, the victory never came, and Luxembourg would play host to the German high command for another four years. At the end of the occupation, Luxembourg City was the scene of an attempted communist revolution; on 9 November 1918, communists declared a socialist republic, but it lasted only a few hours.In 1921, the city limits were greatly expanded. The communes of Eich, Hamm, Hollerich, and Rollingergrund were incorporated into Luxembourg City, making the city the largest commune in the country (a position that it would hold until 1978).\nIn 1940, Germany occupied Luxembourg again. The Nazis were not prepared to allow Luxembourgers self-government, and gradually integrated Luxembourg into the Third Reich by informally attaching the country administratively to a neighbouring German province. Under the occupation, the capital city's streets all received new, German names, which was announced on 4 October 1940. The Avenue de la Libert\u00e9 for example, a major road leading to the railway station, was renamed \"Adolf-Hitlerstra\u00dfe\". Luxembourg City was liberated on 10 September 1944. The city was under long-range bombardment by the German V-3 cannon in December 1944 and January 1945.\nAfter the war, Luxembourg ended its neutrality, and became a founding member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the European Parliament until 1981. Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Investment Bank. Several departments of the European Commission are also based in Luxembourg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe highest point of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is Kneiff at 560 m, closely followed by Burgplatz at 559 m and Napoleonsgaart at 554 m.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLuxembourg City lies on the southern part of the Luxembourg plateau, a large Early Jurassic sandstone formation that forms the heart of the Gutland, a low-lying and flat area that covers the southern two-thirds of the country.\nThe city centre occupies a picturesque site on a salient, perched high on precipitous cliffs that drop into the narrow valleys of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers, whose confluence is in Luxembourg City. The 70 m (230 ft) deep gorges cut by the rivers are spanned by many bridges and viaducts, including the Adolphe Bridge, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and the Passerelle. Although Luxembourg City is not particularly large, its layout is complex, as the city is set on several levels, straddling hills and dropping into the two gorges.\nThe commune of Luxembourg City covers an area of over 51 km2 (20 sq mi), or 2% of the Grand Duchy's total area. This makes the city the fourth-largest commune in Luxembourg, and by far the largest urban area. Luxembourg City is not particularly densely populated, at about 1,700 people per km2; large areas of Luxembourg City are maintained as parks, forested areas, or sites of important heritage (particularly the UNESCO sites), while there are also large tracts of farmland within the city limits.\n\n\n=== Quarters of Luxembourg City ===\n\nLuxembourg City is subdivided into twenty-four quarters (French: quartiers), which cover the commune in its entirety. The quarters generally correspond to the major neighbourhoods and suburbs of Luxembourg City, although a few of the historic districts, such as Bonnevoie, are divided between two quarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nConsidering its latitude, Luxembourg City has an oceanic climate, with moderate precipitation, cold to cool winters and warm summers. Moderate to heavy cloud cover is present for more than two-thirds of the year.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nUnder the Luxembourgian constitution, local government is centred on the city's communal council. Consisting of twenty-seven members (fixed since 1964), each elected every six years on the second Sunday of October and taking office on 1 January of the next year, the council is the largest of all communal councils in Luxembourg. The city is nowadays considered a stronghold of the Democratic Party (DP), which is the second-largest party nationally. Currently, the Democratic Party is the largest party on the council, with eleven councillors.The city's administration is headed by the mayor, who is the leader of the largest party on the communal council. After Xavier Bettel became Luxembourg's new prime minister on 4 December 2013, Lydie Polfer (DP) was sworn in as new mayor of Luxembourg on 17 December of the same year. The mayor leads the cabinet, the coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal, in which the DP forms a coalition with The Greens. Unlike other cities in Luxembourg, which are limited to four \u00e9chevins at most, Luxembourg is given special dispensation to have six \u00e9chevins on its coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal.\n\n\n=== National government ===\n\nLuxembourg City is the seat for the Luxembourg Government. The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg lives at Berg Castle in Colmar-Berg.\nFor national elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the city is located in the Centre constituency.\n\n\n=== European institutions ===\nLuxembourg City is the seat of several institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank. The majority of these institutions are located in the Kirchberg quarter, in the northeast of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDespite the city's comparatively small size, it has several notable museums: the recently renovated National Museum of History and Art (MNHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam) and National Museum of Natural History (NMHN). The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications. In addition to its two main theatres, the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Capucins, there is a new concert hall, the Philharmonie, as well as a conservatory with a large auditorium. Art galleries include the Villa Vauban, the Casino Luxembourg and Am Tunnel.Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, along with the Romanian city of Sibiu, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.\nLuxembourg City is also famed for its wide selection of restaurants and cuisines, including four Michelin starred establishments.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe ING Europe Marathon has been contested annually in the capital since June 2006. It attracted 11,000 runners and over 100,000 spectators during the 2014 edition\nThe Luxembourg Open is a tennis tournament held since 1991 in the capital. The tournament runs from 13 to 21 October. BGL BNP Paribas, one of the more famous sponsors in the world of tennis, was the contracted title sponsor of the tournament until 2014.\nThe D'Coque National Sporting and Cultural Centre, in the quarter of Kirchberg, is the largest sporting venue in the country, with a capacity of 8,300 for indoor sports and swimming.\nThe two football clubs of the city of Luxembourg; Racing FC Union Luxembourg and FC RM Hamm Benfica, play in the country's highest league, the Luxembourg National Division. The 8,000-seater Stade Josy Barthel hosts the Luxembourg national football team, and CAL Spora Luxembourg, which with 400 members is the nation's largest athletics club.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nPlaces of interest include the Gothic Revival Cathedral of Notre Dame, the fortifications, the AM Tunnel (an art gallery underground), the Grand Ducal Palace, the G\u00eblle Fra war memorial, the casemates, the Neum\u00fcnster Abbey, the Place d'Armes, the Adolphe Bridge and the city hall. The city is the home of the University of Luxembourg and RTL Group.\nThe Second World War Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial is located within the city limits of Luxembourg at Hamm. This cemetery is the final resting place of 5,076 American military dead, including General George S. Patton. There is also a memorial to 371 Americans whose remains were never recovered or identified.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nLuxembourg is situated in the heart of Europe in the Gold Triangle between Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam. It is therefore connected to several motorways and international routes.\n\nA1 (E44): to Grevenmacher and Trier (Germany).\nA3 (E25): to Dudelange and Thionville (France).\nA4: to Esch-sur-Alzette and to A13 to P\u00e9tange, Athus (Belgium) and Longwy (France)\nA6 (E25 / E411): to Arlon and Brussels.\nA7 (E421): to Mersch and Ettelbruck.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nLuxembourg City is served by five rail stations operated by the state rail company, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), including the principal station and terminus of all rail lines in the Grand Duchy, Luxembourg station. Stations in Luxembourg City are served by domestic rail services operated by CFL, as well as international rail services, operated by CFL,  and German, Belgian, and French service providers. Additionally, Luxembourg station is connected to the French LGV Est network, providing high-speed services on to Paris and Strasbourg. Services to Basel and Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland are available via two daily scheduled international trains.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nLuxembourg City has a network of 31 bus routes, operated by the municipal transport authority, Autobus de la Ville de Luxembourg (AVL), partly subcontracted to private bus companies. There is also a free bus service linking the Glacis to Luxembourg station, the \"Joker Line\" for seniors, and a \"City night network\". A \"Park & Ride\"  scheme is operated by the city with five carparks connected to the bus network. In addition to AVL buses, CFL and RGTR operate regional buses to other locales in Luxembourg and nearby cities in Germany and France.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\nOn 10 December 2017, the first stage of Luxembourg City's new tram line opened between Luxexpo and the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge serving the Kirchberg quarter. An extension to the city centre (St\u00e4replaz-\u00c9toile) was opened on 27 July 2018. Further extensions to Luxembourg station, Bonnevoie, Howald, and Cloche d\u2019Or are due to be completed by 2020/21.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLuxembourg City is served by the only international airport in the country: Luxembourg Airport (codes: IATA: LUX, ICAO: ELLX). Accessibility to the airport, situated in the commune of Sandweiler, 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from the city centre, is provided via the municipal bus network, with a tram connection due to be completed by 2021. The airport is the principal hub for Luxembourg's flag carrier, Luxair, and one of the world's largest cargo airlines, Cargolux.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLuxembourg is a member of the QuattroPole union of cities, along with Trier, Saarbr\u00fccken, and Metz (neighbouring countries: Germany and France).\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nLuxembourg is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Luxembourg City\nCessange\nEurovision Song Contest 1962, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1966, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1973, held at the  Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\nEurovision Song Contest 1984, held in the Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of Luxembourg City\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMakos, Adam (2019).

          "The Casemates is a UNESCO world heritage site. This fortress is an intricate underground military defence system going back to the 10th century. It is full of mystery and provides for interesting discussions as you explore the different areas. It is well worth a visit when you",

          "Loved exploring around the Bock. Closed in late Fall and Winter, but still very cool walking around and you can get a good idea of the fortifications. I hIghly recommend hiking up and down the hills around here for views of the Bock and the other fortifications.",
          "Looking out over the Petrusse Casemates is very nice but as an attraction it leaves much to be desired. Firstly, it is not clear how you are supposed to access them (no signs or anything), and secondly there is no indication that they're closed when you finally do find what you",
          "It took me about one hour to explore inside the casemates. Since I am a medieval time and ruin fan, I had to visit the casemates and I really enjoyed going through, enjoying views from all of the openings. You should wear good shoes since there are very many steps inside.",

          "I loved this, being an engineer, a lover of architecture, and archaeology. I learned a lot from a tour of the Petrusse Casemates at Brock. Vauban was senior military engineer, the finest builder of fortifications, and attacker of them of his era, for a hundred years. It was said",

          "The casements were built in the 1600 as an enhancement to the Casement du Bock; look down from Constitution square and see a wonderfully manicured park, and a nice nature walk that takes you to the Adolphus bridge... but if you go down the steps of the left side of the tourist",
          "We chose to go in here as we were about to walk the walls when the heavens opened. It was definitely a good choice. The leaflet gave some history and information about the different areas inside. The ground is uneven and there are lots of spiral stairs so good shoes",

          "Avoid if you are claustrophobic! It is really interesting to see how people lived and fighted during the war. You can navigate through the tunnels and even get lost for a moment until you see more people or open your map! It costs 4 euros per person or 3 euros for students.",
          "I regard this walk as a must see to get and understand the spirit of the city of Luxembourg. various guided walks are offered but you can also just take a self guided version and enjoy",
          "I absolutely love the casemates. It fascinates me how people managed to build such great stuff back in the old days. It is especially nice to roam in these tunnels during a hot summer day where they offer great refuge from the sun. But be prepared to freeze during the winter",

          "Definitely a must for first time visitors. I think a lot of visitors don't know what is directly under their feet when wandering about above. It was only \u20ac4 (adult) entry. There are warnings for the elderly and people with heart problems which I thought seem quite valid. There",
          "Luxembourg city started as a fort in the middle ages. Many powers have ruled there later, such as the Romans, the Spaniards, the French, the Hapsburg, etc...The city shows evidence of all these rulers. I recommend seeing old town .",
          "Based in the centre of Luxembourg this is an interesting attraction which takes you below ground into the casemates of the old city for a small fee. As you would expect this is cool, damp and involves a lot of steps, nothing too strenuous though. To be honest you only see a",
          "This is obviously a must visit spot in Luxemburg. Ruins of an ancient castle in the middle of the city center. With a 4e admission fee you have the chance to experience this UWH attraction. To me the best part of this was the amazing sights of the many openings in the walls of",
          "Nice tour and interesting to see how they made all of it. The tour guide didn't seem to know more then necessary. Would been nice with some more history of what it would've been like to be there hundreds of years ago.",
          "This old defensive pathways are chopped in the rocks, it has probably be an immense job to create them. You can wander around them for a small fee, it's cool inside on a hot summer day and the circular walk actually starts inside.",
          "Be prepared for lots of steps (comfortable flat shoes necessary). The 40 min tour (fee 3 euros)with a guide is extremely interesting and I learnt lots of facts about the history of Luxembourg. Entrance is on the Consitution Square and there are tours every hour. There are",
          "Was keen to go down here and look around but after 20 minutes trying to find a way down we gave up and left. Shame the place looked very interesting.",
          "The casemates in the city were my favorite sight to see. You can take a stroll through the cliffs where they built the casemates. It offers some really nice views and if the weather is good it makes for a really pleasant stroll. I think they close in the Winter time so its best",
          "Especially if it's a nice day, this part of Luxembourg situated below St. Peter's cathedral and the casemates is fascinating for a short stroll. There are so many look outs and wonderful little photo spots it makes for a nice casual walk along the river. Maybe spend 1-2 hours",
          "Our family really enjoyed touring this ancient site. We explored each and every crevice. It really helps the experience if you read the information they give you at the ticket counter. There are interesting stories and myths hidden in those walls! Yes, there is a lot of walking,",
          "There are well preserved and well integrated into the regular comings and goings of locals. You will probably take photos of this from above anyway and if you end up along the water, you might as well go and take a look. Would give a \"4\" rating if there was actually something",
          "We went down to Luxembourg for the first time (mostly because we could) and spent over two hours walking through the caves. There are no markings or explanations of any type (French, English, German or the national language Luxembourgish). Nothing at all. And that was fine.",
          "This is a little hidden hideaway in quiet Luxembourg City. You can take the tour bus or have a lesurely stroll and a steep climb up to the main town. Green grassy areas, play park for kids and a few restaurants open in the evening. Small quaint hotels and a tourist office tucked",
          "I was amazed by its architecture and the fact that its a UNESCO world heritage site made it look just awesome. It was nice to know that how the people of Luxembourg saved their city with this unique architecture. A must visit site in Luxembourg.",
          "For a mere 3 euro fee, a guide takes you on a 40 minute (approximately) tour through the casements. Lots of stairs with handrails and comfy shoes are suggested. Our tour was in English and the guides speak English, French and German. The guide provides a historical prospective",
          "Going down to the river is possible to get an up close view of this site however I would recommend just some photos of the Pertrusse Casements from the Casements du Boc up above.",
          "Do not skip this attraction! It cost 3 Euros for student and 4 Euros for others to get in. I really liked the views and the mix of modern display among the twisting tunnels of the Casemates. It does not overwhelm the original architecture. I recommend being EXTREMELY careful",
          "It is worth it, doesn't take long, good place to start learning about this beautiful little country. The 450 steps are not that hard to navigate.",
          "The most convenient way to enter the Petrusse Casemates is via the staircase at the Gelle Fre monument. The roads down below stretch on a long way so great for a peaceful walk. As the area is so vast, I'd recommend hiring one of the public 'Vel-oh' bikes and cycling through.",
          "The Petrusse casemates are only open in summer and you can only visit in a guided group, which is good, otherwise you could get lost beneath the city! You go through a vast network of narrow, dank tunnels which have played a part in all major events of the city's history for",
          "Every time I am there, I have to visit Petrusse Casemates, I look for lovely restaurants while enjoying a great view",
          "Nothing routine in this area. We just did not have all the time needed to get everything out of the area. We will be back to enjoy another season. I understand and can visualize everything in bloom.",
          "Interesting place,but our guide was a student of law who told us only the information which we could read from our leaflet. We could see only a couple tunnels.In the casemates is only one canon and not any other exhibitions. Comparing to other casemates (maginot line,",
          "I love history, and this is a good spot to learn about it. Layers upon layers of views, and wandering. This combined with the Casemates du Bock provided my husband and me with a whole morning of exploration. We even took our small dog with us!",
          "If you happen to be in Luxembourg, this is a must. Really interesting & great views over the city. Make sure you have someone with you that has a good sense of direction!",
          "The walk in the casemates can only be done in the summer . It s a long ,long tunneling under the city of Luxembourg . Very interesting , historical , amazing . A good way to escape the heat when the summer gets too hot to stroll in the city.",
          "The first thing you need to know about this casemates is that most of the photos here are in fact from Casemates du Bock. Both casemates are interesting and unique. I recommend going on both to see the difference. These casemates are open only part of the year and require",
          "Ok, so lets call a spade a spade, there isn't much to do in Luxembourg! The Petrusse Casemates however, were an exception. Whilst of course there isn't too much you can do to glamourise a set of underground tunnels and fortifications, our guide provided a well-informed and",
          "An interesting insight into the fortifications carved out of the rock. Although you get a leaflet on entry the way around the passages is not very clearly marked and you can easily find yourself having to retrace your steps along very narrow stairways.",
          "We happened to pass just before a tour started. The price of 3 Euro's per person is excellent value. Others have commented on the nature of the tour. There are low sections, the steps are uneven and it is dark so be careful if you have difficulties with steps. Our tour guide",
          "two different casemates, one free with guided tour (the one opposite the cathedral) and worth going to! tours on the hour by a student. good",
          "Lots of corridors and off shoots to explore. What this must have been before so much was destroyed in the 1800's!",
          "Petrusse Casemates are not open year-round like the bock casemates. Only on specific dates (including easter, whitsuntide, etc) and only via a guided tour. The casemates are not renovated like the bock casemates and therefore give you a good feel of how they actually looked and",
          "I always thought that the \"Casemates\" where the underground passages which thread deap down throughout the City of Luxembourg - but they also include all the above ground fortifications - well worth seeing",
          "Worth a quick visit, but guided tours only. Small in comparison to the Bock Casemates.",
          "the tour here was excellent and it was cool to see the city saving moat. short tour with great views of the adolphe bridge",
          "The place is very well kept, clean and you can spend almost an entire day seeing it all. There are several great vantage points for pictures as well",
          "Guided tour help to understand what was there, well kept, can see and get the feeling of the time period",
          "Yes, just ok. If you're looking for something amazing in these tunnels you're really not going to find it. Just the idea that they built these tunnels so long ago is amazing considering the tools involved. It's cool and sort of damp and loads of stairs. If it's a hot or warm",
          "First things first, if you're tall (like 6 foot) you will have to duck or walked stooped over nearly the entire time. Don't let that discourage you from seeing this, however. The casemates are really awesome and there's a cannon dating from the 10th century there. They're damp",
          "While the views may not be as spectacular as from the Bock casemates, they are very impressive. The maze of tunnels and the height of these enforcements make one realize why Luxumbourg was indeed a true fortress. Well worth a visit and make sure you add some time to your visit"

According to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, reason is the power of synthesizing into unity, by means of comprehensive principles, the concepts that are provided by the intellect. That reason which gives a priori principles Kant calls \u201cpure reason,\u201d as distinguished from the \u201cpractical reason,\u201d which is specially concerned with the performance of actions. In formal logic the drawing of inferences (frequently called \u201cratiocination,\u201d from Latin ratiocinari, \u201cto use the reasoning faculty\u201d) is classified from Aristotle on as deductive (from generals to particulars) and inductive (from particulars to generals).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More on This Topic\nthought: Reasoning\nReasoning consists of the derivation of inferences or conclusions from a set of premises by means of the application of...\n\n\n\nIn theology, reason, as distinguished from faith, is the human intelligence exercised upon religious truth whether by way of discovery or by way of explanation. The limits within which the reason may be used have been laid down differently in different churches and periods of thought: on the whole, modern Christianity, especially in the Protestant churches, tends to allow to reason a wide field, reserving, however, as the sphere of faith the ultimate (supernatural) truths of theology.

        "wiki": "Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: L\u00ebtzebuerg, French: Luxembourg, German: Luxemburg), also known as Luxembourg City (Luxembourgish: Stad L\u00ebtzebuerg or d'Stad, French: Ville de Luxembourg, German: Stadt Luxemburg, Luxemburg-Stadt), is the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the country's most populous commune. Standing at the confluence of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers in southern Luxembourg, the city lies at the heart of Western Europe, situated 213 km (132 mi) by road from Brussels, 372 km (231 mi) from Paris, and 209 km (130 mi) from Cologne. The city contains Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.\nAs of 31 December 2019, Luxembourg City has a population of 122,273 inhabitants, which is more than three times the population of the country's second most populous commune (Esch-sur-Alzette). The city's population consists of 160 nationalities. Foreigners represent 70% of the city's population, while Luxembourgers represent 30% of the population, and the number of foreign-born residents in the city rises steadily each year.In 2011, Luxembourg was ranked as having the second-highest per capita GDP in the world at $80,119 (PPP), with the city having developed into a banking and administrative centre. In the 2011 Mercer worldwide survey of 221 cities, Luxembourg was placed first for personal safety, while it was ranked 19th for quality of living.Luxembourg is one of the de facto capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg), as it is the seat of several institutions, agencies, and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, and Eurostat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Roman era, a fortified tower guarded the crossing of two Roman roads that met at the site of Luxembourg city. Through an exchange treaty with the abbey of Saint Maximin in Trier in 963, Siegfried I of the Ardennes, a close relative of King Louis II of France and Emperor Otto the Great, acquired the feudal lands of Luxembourg. Siegfried built his castle, named Lucilinburhuc (\"small castle\"), on the Bock Fiels (\"rock\"), mentioned for the first time in the aforementioned exchange treaty.\nIn 987, Archbishop Egbert of Trier consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael's Church). At a Roman road intersection near the church, a marketplace appeared around which the city developed.\nThe city, because of its location and natural geography, has through history been a place of strategic military significance. The first fortifications were built as early as the 10th century. By the end of the 12th century, as the city expanded westward around the new St. Nicholas Church (today the Cathedral of Notre Dame), new walls were built that included an area of 5 hectares (12 acres). In about 1340, under the reign of John the Blind, new fortifications were built that stood until 1867.\nIn 1443, the Burgundians under Philip the Good conquered Luxembourg. Luxembourg became part of the Burgundian, and later Spanish and Austrian empires (See Spanish Netherlands and Spanish Road) and under those Habsburg administrations Luxembourg Castle was repeatedly strengthened so that by the 16th century, Luxembourg itself was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. Subsequently, the Burgundians, the Spanish, the French, the Spanish again, the Austrians, the French again, and the Prussians conquered Luxembourg.\nIn the 17th century, the first casemates were built; initially, Spain built 23 km (14 mi) of tunnels, starting in 1644. These were then enlarged under French rule by Marshal Vauban, and augmented again under Austrian rule in the 1730s and 1740s.\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, the city was occupied by France twice: once, briefly, in 1792\u20133, and, later, after a seven-month siege. Luxembourg held out for so long under the French siege that French politician and military engineer Lazare Carnot called Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city's nickname: the 'Gibraltar of the North'.Nonetheless, the Austrian garrison eventually surrendered, and as a consequence, Luxembourg was annexed by the French Republic, becoming part of the d\u00e9partement of For\u00eats, with Luxembourg City as its pr\u00e9fecture. Under the 1815 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars, Luxembourg City was placed under Prussian military control as a part of the German Confederation, although sovereignty passed to the House of Orange-Nassau, in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis, the 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg to dismantle the fortifications in Luxembourg City. Their demolition took sixteen years, cost 1.5 million gold francs, and required the destruction of over 24 km (15 mi) of underground defences and 4 hectares (9.9 acres) of casemates, batteries, barracks, etc. Furthermore, the Prussian garrison was to be withdrawn.\n\nWhen, in 1890, Grand Duke William III died without any male heirs, the Grand Duchy passed out of Dutch hands, and into an independent line under Grand Duke Adolphe. Thus, Luxembourg, which had hitherto been independent in theory only, became a truly independent country, and Luxembourg City regained some of the importance that it had lost in 1867 by becoming the capital of a fully independent state.\nDespite Luxembourg's best efforts to remain neutral in the First World War, it was occupied by Germany on 2 August 1914. On 30 August, Helmuth von Moltke moved his headquarters to Luxembourg City, closer to his armies in France in preparation for a swift victory. However, the victory never came, and Luxembourg would play host to the German high command for another four years. At the end of the occupation, Luxembourg City was the scene of an attempted communist revolution; on 9 November 1918, communists declared a socialist republic, but it lasted only a few hours.In 1921, the city limits were greatly expanded. The communes of Eich, Hamm, Hollerich, and Rollingergrund were incorporated into Luxembourg City, making the city the largest commune in the country (a position that it would hold until 1978).\nIn 1940, Germany occupied Luxembourg again. The Nazis were not prepared to allow Luxembourgers self-government, and gradually integrated Luxembourg into the Third Reich by informally attaching the country administratively to a neighbouring German province. Under the occupation, the capital city's streets all received new, German names, which was announced on 4 October 1940. The Avenue de la Libert\u00e9 for example, a major road leading to the railway station, was renamed \"Adolf-Hitlerstra\u00dfe\". Luxembourg City was liberated on 10 September 1944. The city was under long-range bombardment by the German V-3 cannon in December 1944 and January 1945.\nAfter the war, Luxembourg ended its neutrality, and became a founding member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the European Parliament until 1981. Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Investment Bank. Several departments of the European Commission are also based in Luxembourg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe highest point of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is Kneiff at 560 m, closely followed by Burgplatz at 559 m and Napoleonsgaart at 554 m.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLuxembourg City lies on the southern part of the Luxembourg plateau, a large Early Jurassic sandstone formation that forms the heart of the Gutland, a low-lying and flat area that covers the southern two-thirds of the country.\nThe city centre occupies a picturesque site on a salient, perched high on precipitous cliffs that drop into the narrow valleys of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers, whose confluence is in Luxembourg City. The 70 m (230 ft) deep gorges cut by the rivers are spanned by many bridges and viaducts, including the Adolphe Bridge, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and the Passerelle. Although Luxembourg City is not particularly large, its layout is complex, as the city is set on several levels, straddling hills and dropping into the two gorges.\nThe commune of Luxembourg City covers an area of over 51 km2 (20 sq mi), or 2% of the Grand Duchy's total area. This makes the city the fourth-largest commune in Luxembourg, and by far the largest urban area. Luxembourg City is not particularly densely populated, at about 1,700 people per km2; large areas of Luxembourg City are maintained as parks, forested areas, or sites of important heritage (particularly the UNESCO sites), while there are also large tracts of farmland within the city limits.\n\n\n=== Quarters of Luxembourg City ===\n\nLuxembourg City is subdivided into twenty-four quarters (French: quartiers), which cover the commune in its entirety. The quarters generally correspond to the major neighbourhoods and suburbs of Luxembourg City, although a few of the historic districts, such as Bonnevoie, are divided between two quarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nConsidering its latitude, Luxembourg City has an oceanic climate, with moderate precipitation, cold to cool winters and warm summers. Moderate to heavy cloud cover is present for more than two-thirds of the year.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nUnder the Luxembourgian constitution, local government is centred on the city's communal council. Consisting of twenty-seven members (fixed since 1964), each elected every six years on the second Sunday of October and taking office on 1 January of the next year, the council is the largest of all communal councils in Luxembourg. The city is nowadays considered a stronghold of the Democratic Party (DP), which is the second-largest party nationally. Currently, the Democratic Party is the largest party on the council, with eleven councillors.The city's administration is headed by the mayor, who is the leader of the largest party on the communal council. After Xavier Bettel became Luxembourg's new prime minister on 4 December 2013, Lydie Polfer (DP) was sworn in as new mayor of Luxembourg on 17 December of the same year. The mayor leads the cabinet, the coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal, in which the DP forms a coalition with The Greens. Unlike other cities in Luxembourg, which are limited to four \u00e9chevins at most, Luxembourg is given special dispensation to have six \u00e9chevins on its coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal.\n\n\n=== National government ===\n\nLuxembourg City is the seat for the Luxembourg Government. The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg lives at Berg Castle in Colmar-Berg.\nFor national elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the city is located in the Centre constituency.\n\n\n=== European institutions ===\nLuxembourg City is the seat of several institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank. The majority of these institutions are located in the Kirchberg quarter, in the northeast of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDespite the city's comparatively small size, it has several notable museums: the recently renovated National Museum of History and Art (MNHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam) and National Museum of Natural History (NMHN). The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications. In addition to its two main theatres, the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Capucins, there is a new concert hall, the Philharmonie, as well as a conservatory with a large auditorium. Art galleries include the Villa Vauban, the Casino Luxembourg and Am Tunnel.Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, along with the Romanian city of Sibiu, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.\nLuxembourg City is also famed for its wide selection of restaurants and cuisines, including four Michelin starred establishments.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe ING Europe Marathon has been contested annually in the capital since June 2006. It attracted 11,000 runners and over 100,000 spectators during the 2014 edition\nThe Luxembourg Open is a tennis tournament held since 1991 in the capital. The tournament runs from 13 to 21 October. BGL BNP Paribas, one of the more famous sponsors in the world of tennis, was the contracted title sponsor of the tournament until 2014.\nThe D'Coque National Sporting and Cultural Centre, in the quarter of Kirchberg, is the largest sporting venue in the country, with a capacity of 8,300 for indoor sports and swimming.\nThe two football clubs of the city of Luxembourg; Racing FC Union Luxembourg and FC RM Hamm Benfica, play in the country's highest league, the Luxembourg National Division. The 8,000-seater Stade Josy Barthel hosts the Luxembourg national football team, and CAL Spora Luxembourg, which with 400 members is the nation's largest athletics club.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nPlaces of interest include the Gothic Revival Cathedral of Notre Dame, the fortifications, the AM Tunnel (an art gallery underground), the Grand Ducal Palace, the G\u00eblle Fra war memorial, the casemates, the Neum\u00fcnster Abbey, the Place d'Armes, the Adolphe Bridge and the city hall. The city is the home of the University of Luxembourg and RTL Group.\nThe Second World War Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial is located within the city limits of Luxembourg at Hamm. This cemetery is the final resting place of 5,076 American military dead, including General George S. Patton. There is also a memorial to 371 Americans whose remains were never recovered or identified.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nLuxembourg is situated in the heart of Europe in the Gold Triangle between Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam. It is therefore connected to several motorways and international routes.\n\nA1 (E44): to Grevenmacher and Trier (Germany).\nA3 (E25): to Dudelange and Thionville (France).\nA4: to Esch-sur-Alzette and to A13 to P\u00e9tange, Athus (Belgium) and Longwy (France)\nA6 (E25 / E411): to Arlon and Brussels.\nA7 (E421): to Mersch and Ettelbruck.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nLuxembourg City is served by five rail stations operated by the state rail company, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), including the principal station and terminus of all rail lines in the Grand Duchy, Luxembourg station. Stations in Luxembourg City are served by domestic rail services operated by CFL, as well as international rail services, operated by CFL,  and German, Belgian, and French service providers. Additionally, Luxembourg station is connected to the French LGV Est network, providing high-speed services on to Paris and Strasbourg. Services to Basel and Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland are available via two daily scheduled international trains.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nLuxembourg City has a network of 31 bus routes, operated by the municipal transport authority, Autobus de la Ville de Luxembourg (AVL), partly subcontracted to private bus companies. There is also a free bus service linking the Glacis to Luxembourg station, the \"Joker Line\" for seniors, and a \"City night network\". A \"Park & Ride\"  scheme is operated by the city with five carparks connected to the bus network. In addition to AVL buses, CFL and RGTR operate regional buses to other locales in Luxembourg and nearby cities in Germany and France.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\nOn 10 December 2017, the first stage of Luxembourg City's new tram line opened between Luxexpo and the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge serving the Kirchberg quarter. An extension to the city centre (St\u00e4replaz-\u00c9toile) was opened on 27 July 2018. Further extensions to Luxembourg station, Bonnevoie, Howald, and Cloche d\u2019Or are due to be completed by 2020/21.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLuxembourg City is served by the only international airport in the country: Luxembourg Airport (codes: IATA: LUX, ICAO: ELLX). Accessibility to the airport, situated in the commune of Sandweiler, 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from the city centre, is provided via the municipal bus network, with a tram connection due to be completed by 2021. The airport is the principal hub for Luxembourg's flag carrier, Luxair, and one of the world's largest cargo airlines, Cargolux.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLuxembourg is a member of the QuattroPole union of cities, along with Trier, Saarbr\u00fccken, and Metz (neighbouring countries: Germany and France).\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nLuxembourg is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Luxembourg City\nCessange\nEurovision Song Contest 1962, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1966, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1973, held at the  Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\nEurovision Song Contest 1984, held in the Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of Luxembourg City\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMakos, Adam (2019).

The museum offers a caf\u00e9 and a little shop, like almost any modern museum, and one can see that they tried to",
          "The Museum is not very interesting and be ready to be told off every time you / your child stands too close to the exhibits. I guess a museum of natural sciences should be designed as child-friendly but not there! Moreover, the signs are not clear enough regarding what can or",

          "Just 5 euros entrance fee. The exhibits were over a few floors & were well laid out. The only issue for us were information was 95% in French & German. Good to amble around in the cool though.",

          "Tucked away behind a fairly nondescript entrance, this is a brilliant and expansive museum, with very friendly and helpful staff, that is well worth a visit. It\u2019s crammed with interesting exhibits, covering a wide range of subjects, and even has a chute to slide down between",
          "This is a great museum but unfortunately almost nothing is in English, which made it less interesting for my 14-year old than I had hoped.",
          "If you want to know all about the earth and its nature, animals as well as want to find out more about the first Luxemburger then this is your museum. It is reasonably interactive with a lot of thing to open and discover albeit most signs come in German/French only. In the end,",

          "My 3-year-old son loves the Museum of Natural History in Paris but he was bored and sometimes a bit scared in this museum. I think it is aimed at slightly older children: there are a lot of interactive displays to teach kids about the natural world, rather than static displays",

          "This museum was not bad. First off, the price is right. We paid 9 Euro for a family ticket, and that is pretty good in this area. On the plus side, this museum seems fairly modern and well taken care of. It does have a few fairly good wild animal (stuffed) displays. There",
          "I'm giving this 3 stars just because my daughter loved it so much. I'm not quite sure why, but she did. She's 4. I promised her dinosaurs, which there were none, but she still loved it. There were a lot of stuff animals everywhere and she really liked them. There were"

          "Fantastic view of the valley, nice IG photos :) 4free and accessible to everybody. Has been going to Luxembourg for years but did not know about this lift but then decided to check out visitluxembourg.com, so sometimes it is worth to get familiar with tourist information.",
          "Great way to get an excellent view of the old city, while also being a quick way to get down to or up from it. And it's free!",
          "Beautiful view ! It is a must visit if you are in the area! the lift is free and once downstairs you can take a nice walk!",
          "This sleek, quick elevator wasn't open when I last visited Luxembourg City in 2009 so now it exists, it's great that you don't have to slog up and down a lot of stairs to get to and from the old town in the valley below. It also gives you great views as you go up and down - and",
          "You must still be wondering if this is free! *end of sarcasm* Take a couple of rides if you wish during off peak hours. Luxembourg is not a crowded city anyway but still be mindful!",
          "Absolutely worth a visit. We went up and down and then back up! No queues, no fees, no crowds. Great views. Lots of people with bikes too as it's a large lift - easier than cycling for sure! There's a platform at the top too which just out beyond the lift so good for a photo",
          "We took the funicular railway to the bottom of the valley, walked across to the lift then used this to get back to the main part of the city. The lift is completely free and relatively fast to climb. Take the time to look out over the valley as it climbs and enjoy the view. On",
          "No queues, no cost - what's not to like? We travelled from Ground upwards and the took some pictures at the top. The glass floor is a little scratched these days",
          "At the edge of the main city centre area, lovely walk to and around the lift. The lift is free which was great! Its a quick lift to the top but the views are lovely, especially with the trees in autumn! and its open late",
          "It's a quick ride up or down, and yes, it has glass walls over a certain part so that you can see the view outside. It's pleasant and fairly pretty, but I would not go far out of my way to find it.",
          "Lift was a short walk from our hotel and well worth it. Once there, you walked down a corridor and to a large elevator. Great views.",
          "I was so surprised this was FREE! Not only the view but the glass elevator was great. Went to one of the cafes by the river. Quite a different world down there! Then caught the lift back up. Oh and yes free toilets at the bottom. Would recommend.",
          "This lift can be reached both side either from the hill or the down, free transportation from metro station to the Lift. well maintained and provide nice view on the top. Its recommended to visit it",
          "It was fast! But not bad for those who are scared of height. It is basically very cool to know that we can actually have a lift in the middle of a city (and outdoor!), not only in buildings.",
          "Amazing views from the lift and from the glass ended corridor. A good way to get to the lower part of Luxembourg Free to everyone",
          "if you are lucky , the lift is working , because it needs repairs , and the dates are very variable , so try this lift and you will be recompensed with a magic view",

          "What a great place for a lift! A quick way to get up to the cathedral area from the riverside. And the viewing platform has a glass floor. Take your heart tablets! Toilets are at the bottom of the shaft.",
          "Amazing views!! Lift and corridor are super clean. Glass at the end of the corridor bridge and the lift was cool, telling how high up you were too. Not to mention it's FREE! And open till 1am!",
          "good way to visit Luxembourg-City walking, tremendous view, unfortunately often closed for repairs :)",
          "This is a great, free attraction on cicrcular walk in city. We took it down and the views were great! Allowed for top viewing, glass bottom views and then you could continue below on walk to funicular over creek. Real neat place to walk and explore. Amazing that something like",
          "If you don't have vertigo, go up and look down the glass floor :) It is a nice lift that connects a very traditional neighborhood with the center, next to Foundation Pescatore.",
          "This is well worth a visit, to get a wonderful panorama of the city. If you are brave enough you can walk to the end of the glass section of the lift and look down!!! Lift is open until 1 am, has very little waiting time (as it is so efficient) and is free!!",
          "This attraction is free and fun. We got of the hop on hop off bus opposite the funicular station and a five minute walk through luch grounds we were there. The glass part of the viewing station is wonderful and then travel down the 50 metre left to a beautiful part of the city.",
          "Even if you don't want to visit Pfaffenthal it is worth taking a ride up and down in this lift. Offers great views over the valley, and is quick so there is no major delays waiting for it.",
          "Lovely way to see the city from the observation area at the top of the lift! We down the street from atop the city walls, and rode the lift up to the top. Very simple, uncrowned, and gorgeous perspective of the city! Only downside were the people on cycles at the top speeding",
          "It\u2019s definately an interesting place to visit in Luxembourg. Nice view from above with a small part of \u201cglass floor)",
          "A short walk from the city centre and definitely recommended. It's all free, open 0530 to 1am (yes almost 24 hours a day essentially!) NB. Use Google maps to find it using the address, the TripAdvisor marker shows it south of the centre but it is north. This caused some",
          "We combined the funicular railway with the lift on our way into the city one morning. The lift is impressive and fast. The suspended walkway at the top offers great views. The glass floor at the end was interesting and will definitely help you decide if you have a fear of",
          "This elevator came up on my map as I made my way to the fortress. I had no idea there was a lift that would take you to the lower part of town to continue the walk. The elevator gives magnificent views over the hill and the city while you either go up or down (yes it is worth",
          "This was the first place I headed from my hotel in Place d'Armes. A few blocks north, got a view ands sums pictures, and started my walkabout in upper town to see the sights. At the lift, which is free, you just walk through an enclosed \"corridor\", and at the end of it, you're",
          "You need about half to one hour around here to enjoy the view.The lift is free.The view of the city great.",
          "Go up and view the Grund from the top! When you are at the top, take a stroll at the park in front of J.P. Pescatore Foundation, it\u2019s quite beautiful!",
          "Beautiful view and funny experience to take for free an glass lift. Nice Area to visit in Luxembourg city",
          "I was here only because of the view off the elevator shaft, it's absolutely worth a visit. It's a little off the old town but Luxembourg city in general is just a small town you can reach there within 5-7 minutes walk. Great connection down to the lower town also!",
          "Lift can take you down to the Grund or up from the Grund to the centre of the city. Usually there are children art exhibitions down in the tunnel.",
          "Essential requirement for up and down on a regular basis, without it it can be a challenge to the average visitor",
          "Had some extra time so went here to take the elevator to the city. Was high, quick and a glass bottom viewing platform. Worth a short visit",
          "Saw this online before we traveled and was well worth the short walk to the North to find it, easy away to get from high town to low town and a short walk along the valley into the Grund area. Free to use no massive queue and made getting around easier, whats not to like.",
          "There are a few of these around and they are excellent to use as they bring you from the water level to the top! Saves time and effort especially if it\u2019s raining.",
          "an exceptional view of the valley awaits at the end of the corridor, featuring a glass floor. quite spectacular ride down the side of the valley as well - even if, there isn't much to see down below, the lift is worth a visit.",
          "Free to go up and down. Offers views of the lower parts of the city. Worth doing if you're in the area, but the views don't exactly blow you away.",
          "It has a great view of the city (although not as good as from the Chemin), but it is pretty cool being in a glass elevator over such a big height. Lift is free.",
          "This free ride from Pfaffenthal, in the Alzette gorge below the old town of Luxembourg up the cliff to the pretty park at the top provides one of the best views of the Alzette valley. Like Charlie's Great Glass Elevator, it takes the pain out of walking the long, steep road from",

          "experiment ! do it , but every first monday of the month , out of duty , for maintenance, normal , but you should know it",
          "Great view of the red bridge and Mudam (modern museum). Take a walk at the bottom and check out the Pfaffentahl train station. Try the cable car up to Kirchberg and walk back across the bridge.",
          "Excellent view, beautifull building and for free so no reason not to take it. The park next to it is also very relaxing.",
          "First time at the lift. Great views and quick ascent and descent. Very frequent and well worth the time.",
          "This has been my fourth time in this lift. The town view at 64 meters high is fantastic. This lift was a good initiative as it connects Luxembourg ville to Pfaffental village. Pfaffental village offers other historical monuments and the first public transport (bus) without",
          "Very nice view over the city, worth visiting at night, just take the ride down and up again! You will see the Financial Center, pfaffenthal, mudam etc",
          "Recommended by our hotel. This glass elevator at the top is near a nice park. The view from the top is quite ehilarating. Not much to find of interest at the bottom which opens to the Grund having the lower income part of town. There was a foot pool and a couple nice photo",
          "Although this seems touristy, it is actually a way that locals travel between the old part of the city along the river valley and the more modern city above. Plus, the views can't be beat.",
          "Get ready your camera to take some good shot while in the elevator from 71m high! It is free of charge for pedestrians and cyclists. The elevator connects the Pescatore Park located in the city center to the Pfaffenthal area at the bottom of the Alzette valley. Once you are at",
          "Great views across Luxembourg! Free too which was a nice surprise! Worth a visit in the day as well as at night- especially with the Christmas lights.",
          "I use this lift on a regular basis to either go to the city center or down to Pfaffenthal. It also has a nice viewing platform where you see all the lower areas of Luxembourg city. it is well worth trying it out once.",
          "Great lift to see the views above the city and then a walk around. It\u2019s free too which is amazing for a city.",
          "Randomly come across this, and so glad we did. Was a beautiful view and got some breath taking pictures and videos. Make sure you visit the massive building outside the top of the lift it looks like a Palace. Can\u2019t miss it lots of people walking around there too.",
          "The scenery was just amazing. The bridge to the lift has a clear glass platform on the end. If you\u2019re brave enough to look down, you should. It allows you to appreciate the height. It only took 15s to get from the bottom to the top. Best of all... It\u2019s free",
          "The view it is breathtaking ! We stay on glass at more then 100 m high! must have this when you go to Luxemburg",
          "The views from there are very nice. It\u2019s 65 meter high but you will feel much higher and scared to walk on the glass floor.",
          "It's free and a great view point , go down it then walk across to the Funicular railway to go back up .Beware of the driverless buses , bit freaky",
          "A must. The best view of Luxembourg and a surprise under your feet. Plus, if you take the lift and go down, you\u00b4ll find one of the best restaurants in Luxembourg: Madeira Stuff, affordable delicious portuguese food. The best free wifi connection of Luxembourg city is just here",

          "One of the fun things to do in Luxembourg, an elevator that connects the upper town city centre and the lower town old city",

          "Brilliant! It does exactly as you want it to. I wanted to travel up, from the ground level to the viewing platform (see pic) but it also travels the other way... Amazing! As a feat of engineering its clever and useful and it's free!",

          "You really can't complain, you get an amazing view of Pfaffenthal and the surrounding areas before you go down. It is complete with a glass panel that shows the bottom of the lift. Don't look if you are afraid of heights! Worth going for the view alone, also Pfaffenthal is a",
          "We had a little trouble locating this lift, it is slightly outwith the many other centrally located attractions within Luxembourg City, but we were glad that we put in the time and effort to find it, it was certainly very worthwhile. It is also located in a quieter area, away",
          "Another day out with our Seniors Club we got off the train at the new Pfaffanthal station and had a pleasant walk, about half a kilometre or so and took the lift up to the city. The views which you can see on three sides due to the panoramic glass windows are breath taking and",
          "You just have to go up and down in this superb piece of engineering delight. The views are amazing and the sense of height is immense. Go visit and there is no charge ... you could go up and down several times , if that took your fancy!",
          "We decided that we wanted to tour this particular part of Luxembourg so we took the Pfaffenthal Lift both down and back. It was very convenient and efficient. If you do not want to walk (especially up) or have limited time, this is the way to go. And it is free and fast.",
          "I was told by the hotel to take the lift down and look around. I found a trail that walked into the woods. The lift was clean and very efficient.",
          "Just out of the center near the JP Pescatore foundation old-age home you will find Plaffenthal lift which goes down. You can take it while going up from the town and Grund below. But use a lift while going up if you don't like a tiring walk. The view of Grund, Alzette river",

          "Well that's what you'd expect in a lift. Definitely start at the top, and jump up and down on the glass floor panel. Gets you down to, yet another, intersting part of the city.",
          "Great views from the panoramic elevator of the Pfaffenthal connecting \u201cPescatore\u201d park in the city centre to the Pfaffenthal area at the bottom of the Alzette Valley. In the majority of countries, a fun, panoramic lift (ride almost) like this would cost money. Likewise for the",

          "Top notch views for free! Even if you don't take the elevator, it's worth walking out to the end of the top platform to look around. It would be nice if they replaced the scratched glass floor, though.",
          "Really loved taking this free elevator ride. Stunning views over Luxembourg City. The bridge with glass walls and floor at the top is really nice. If you want to do a daytrip visiting Luxembourg City I recommend parking your car at Rue du Bouillon. Free parking for 24 hours and",
          "It is for free and the view is amazing! The elevator has glass walls so you see the whole valley on your way up/down. We just took a trip up and down, but you can of course exit and walk along the old parts of the city to get back as well if you want.",
          "It's located a little way from the main part of the city but worth a visit. The area around is very quiet and scenic and a trip on the lift is free. There is a glass floor at the top which you can stand on and take photos but the view along the valley is really nice and worth",

          "Very nice elevator that brings you from the Paffendal area to the upper city. You have a nice overview of the area below as you can see everything through the glasses. The park that you arrive in at the top is also quite good",
          "This \u201clift\u201d is a great little thing to do. We walked down the hill to get to the bottom of the lift shaft, and then took the glass fronted lift to the top. You really do get an impressive view as it goes up and then you can look out from the enclosed viewing platform at the top",
          "The lift is pretty cool. Great view and big enough for a crowd. The walkway at the top has a small glass floor but it is so scratched that you can't see a lot when you stand on it.",
          "This is a free and fun thing to do while in the city, a little hard to get there by car in the Pfaffenthal area but you can also get there from above. Quick lift and worth 10 minutes of your time!",

          "It takes mere seconds to go from top to bottom and while the views are great it is not hard to find great views elsewhere not Luxembourg. So they\u2019re the reasons to maybe not bother if you\u2019re pushed for time. But it\u2019s free, you can go up and down as many times as you like and",

          "What a view! Simply magnificent! I would consider this a \u201cmust do\u201d when in Luxembourg City. The view is simply stunning...and it is free of charge. Just walk up and get on. But first, step to the end of the entry walk and stand on the glass platform. What a view...then look down",
          "We're older folks, and greatly appreciated the quick route down 4 stories to the lower town. The short tunnel out was lined with rather dreadful artwork, but emerging onto the stunning little plaza at the bottom of the gorge was lovely.",

        "wiki": "Fort Th\u00fcngen is a historic fortification in Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg.  It is sited in Dr\u00e4i Eechelen Park, in the Kirchberg quarter, in the north-east of the city.  It is also colloquially known as Three Acorns (Luxembourgish: Dr\u00e4i Eechelen, French: Trois glands, German: Drei Eicheln) in reference to the acorns that sit atop each of the three towers.Most of the original fortress was demolished after the 1867 Treaty of London, which demanded the demolition of Luxembourg City's numerous fortifications.  The three towers and the foundations of the rest of the fort were all that remained.  During the 1990s, the site was reconstructed in its entirety, in parallel with the development of the site for the construction of the Mudam, Luxembourg's museum of modern art. After being fully restored, the building was reopened in 2012 as Mus\u00e9e Dr\u00e4i Eechelen.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Leave yourself the time to linger and read/watch about the Gibraltar of the north! Lovely museum and surrounding park. Kind staff. Free with Luxembourg card! Well worth the visit!",
          "One of the very well restored outposts of the city's defenses. Very well organized small museum complete with ancient arms and armor exhibits and subterranean tunnels. The views from the roof are also spectacular. Lots of fun for children. \u20ac8 family rate gets 2 adults and 2",
          "We could not visit the museum because of the time we arrive there, but we walk from there to the town and it was a really nice experience. The landscapes were awesome!!"

        "wiki": "Luxembourg ( (listen) LUK-s\u0259m-burg; Luxembourgish: L\u00ebtzebuerg [\u02c8l\u0259ts\u0259bu\u0259\u032f\u0255] (listen); French: Luxembourg; German: Luxemburg), officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in Western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is one of the four official capitals of the European Union (together with Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg) and the seat of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the highest judicial authority in the EU. Its culture, people, and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbours, making it essentially a mixture of French and German cultures, as evident by the nation's three official languages: French, German, and the national language of Luxembourgish. The repeated invasions by Germany, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and, among other things, led to the foundation of the European Union.With an area of 2,586 square kilometres (998 sq mi), it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe. In 2019, Luxembourg had a population of 626,108, which makes it one of the least-populous countries in Europe, but by far the one with the highest population growth rate. Foreigners account for nearly half of Luxembourg's population. As a representative democracy with a constitutional monarch, it is headed by Grand Duke Henri and is the world's only remaining sovereign grand duchy. Luxembourg is a developed country, with an advanced economy and one of the world's highest GDP (PPP) per capita despite being one of the smallest countries in Europe. The City of Luxembourg with its old quarters and fortifications was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994 due to the exceptional preservation of the vast fortifications and the old city.The history of Luxembourg is considered to begin in 963, when count Siegfried acquired a rocky promontory and its Roman-era fortifications known as Lucilinburhuc, \"little castle\", and the surrounding area from the Imperial Abbey of St. Maximin in nearby Trier. Siegfried's descendants increased their territory through marriage, war and vassal relations. At the end of the 13th century, the counts of Luxembourg reigned over a considerable territory. In 1308, Henry VII, Count of Luxembourg became King of the Germans and later Holy Roman Emperor. The House of Luxembourg produced four emperors during the High Middle Ages. In 1354, Charles IV elevated the county to the Duchy of Luxembourg. The duchy eventually became part of the Burgundian Circle and then one of the Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands.\nOver the centuries, the City and Fortress of Luxembourg, of great strategic importance situated between the Kingdom of France and the Habsburg territories, was gradually built up to be one of the most reputed fortifications in Europe. After belonging to both the France of Louis XIV and the Austria of Maria Theresa, Luxembourg became part of the First French Republic and Empire under Napoleon.The present-day state of Luxembourg first emerged at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The Grand Duchy, with its powerful fortress, became an independent state under the personal possession of William I of the Netherlands with a Prussian garrison to guard the city against another invasion from France. In 1839, following the turmoil of the Belgian Revolution, the purely French-speaking part of Luxembourg was ceded to Belgium and the Luxembourgish-speaking part (except the Arelerland, the area around Arlon) became what is the present state of Luxembourg.Luxembourg is a founding member of the European Union, OECD, United Nations, NATO, and Benelux. The city of Luxembourg, which is the country's capital and largest city, is the seat of several institutions and agencies of the EU. Luxembourg served on the United Nations Security Council for the years 2013 and 2014, which was a first in the country's history. As of 2020, Luxembourg citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 187 countries and territories, ranking the Luxembourgish passport fifth in the world, tied with Denmark and Spain.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== County ===\n\nThe recorded history of Luxembourg begins with the acquisition of Lucilinburhuc (today Luxembourg Castle) situated on the Bock rock by Siegfried, Count of Ardennes, in 963 through an exchange act with St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier. Around this fort, a town gradually developed, which became the centre of a state of great strategic value.\n\n\n=== Duchy ===\n\nIn the 14th and early 15th centuries, three members of the House of Luxembourg reigned as Holy Roman Emperors. In 1437, the House of Luxembourg suffered a succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne, which led to the territories being sold by Duchess Elisabeth to Philip the Good of Burgundy.In the following centuries, Luxembourg's fortress was steadily enlarged and strengthened by its successive occupants, the Bourbons, Habsburgs, Hohenzollerns and the French.\n\n\n=== Nineteenth century ===\n\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Luxembourg was disputed between Prussia and the Netherlands. The Congress of Vienna formed Luxembourg as a Grand Duchy within the German Confederation. The Dutch king became, in personal union, the grand duke. Although he was supposed to rule the grand duchy as an independent country with an administration of its own, in reality he treated it similarly to a Dutch province. The Fortress of Luxembourg was manned by Prussian troops for the German Confederation. This arrangement was revised by the 1839 First Treaty of London, from which date Luxembourg's full independence is reckoned.At the time of the Belgian Revolution of 1830\u20131839, and by the 1839 Treaty establishing full independence, Luxembourg's territory was reduced by more than half, as the predominantly francophone western part of the country was transferred to Belgium. In 1842 Luxembourg joined the German Customs Union (Zollverein). This resulted in the opening of the German market, the development of Luxembourg's steel industry, and expansion of Luxembourg's railway network from 1855 to 1875, particularly the construction of the Luxembourg-Thionville railway line, with connections from there to the European industrial regions. While Prussian troops still manned the fortress, in 1861, the Passerelle was opened, the first road bridge spanning the P\u00e9trusse river valley, connecting the Ville Haute and the main fortification on the Bock with Luxembourg railway station, opened in 1859, on the then fortified Bourbon plateau to the south.\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis of 1866 nearly led to war between Prussia and France, the Grand Duchy's independence and neutrality were again affirmed by the 1867 Second Treaty of London, Prussia's troops were withdrawn from the Fortress of Luxembourg, and its Bock and surrounding fortifications were dismantled.The King of the Netherlands remained Head of State as Grand Duke of Luxembourg, maintaining a personal union between the two countries until 1890. At the death of William III, the throne of the Netherlands passed to his daughter Wilhelmina, while Luxembourg (then restricted to male heirs by the Nassau Family Pact) passed to Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg.At the time of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, despite allegations about French use of the Luxembourg railways for passing soldiers from Metz (then part of France) through the Duchy, and for forwarding provisions to Thionville, Luxembourg's neutrality was respected by Germany, and neither France nor Germany invaded the country. But in 1871, as a result of Germany's victory over France, Luxembourg's boundary with Lorraine, containing Metz and Thionville, changed from being a frontier with a part of France to a frontier with territory annexed to the German Empire as Alsace-Lorraine under the Treaty of Frankfurt. This allowed Germany the military advantage of controlling and expanding the railways there.\n\n\n=== Twentieth century and beyond ===\n\nIn August 1914, Imperial Germany violated Luxembourg's neutrality in the war by invading it in the war against France. This allowed Germany to use the railway lines, while at the same time denying them to France. Nevertheless, despite the German occupation, Luxembourg was allowed to maintain much of its independence and political mechanisms.\nIn 1940, after the outbreak of World War II, Luxembourg's neutrality was again violated when the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany entered the country, \"entirely without justification\". In contrast to the First World War, under the German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II, the country was treated as German territory and informally annexed to the adjacent province of the Third Reich. A government in exile based in London supported the Allies, sending a small group of volunteers who participated in the Normandy invasion. Luxembourg was liberated in September 1944, and became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945. Luxembourg's neutral status under the constitution formally ended in 1948, and in 1949 it became a founding member of NATO.\nIn 1951, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Coal and Steel Community, which in 1957 would become the European Economic Community and in 1993 the European Union. In 1999 Luxembourg joined the Eurozone. In 2005, a referendum on the EU treaty establishing a constitution for Europe was held.The steel industry exploiting the Red Lands' rich iron-ore grounds in the beginning of the 20th century drove the country's industrialisation. After the decline of the steel industry in the 1970s, the country focused on establishing itself as a global financial centre and developed into the banking hub it is reputed for. Since the beginning of the 21st century, its governments have focused on developing the country into a knowledge economy, with the founding of the University of Luxembourg and a national space programme, projecting the first involvement in a robotic lunar expedition by 2020.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nLuxembourg is described as a \"full democracy\", with a parliamentary democracy headed by a constitutional monarch. Executive power is exercised by the Grand Duke and the cabinet, which consists of several other ministers. The Constitution of Luxembourg, the supreme law of Luxembourg, was adopted on 17 October 1868. The Grand Duke has the power to dissolve the legislature, in which case new elections must be held within three months. However, since 1919, sovereignty has resided with the Nation, exercised by the Grand Duke in accordance with the Constitution and the law.Legislative power is vested in the Chamber of Deputies, a unicameral legislature of sixty members, who are directly elected to five-year terms from four constituencies. A second body, the Council of State (Conseil d'\u00c9tat), composed of twenty-one ordinary citizens appointed by the Grand Duke, advises the Chamber of Deputies in the drafting of legislation.The Grand Duchy has three lower tribunals (justices de paix; in Esch-sur-Alzette, the city of Luxembourg, and Diekirch), two district tribunals (Luxembourg and Diekirch), and a Superior Court of Justice (Luxembourg), which includes the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation. There is also an Administrative Tribunal and an Administrative Court, as well as a Constitutional Court, all of which are located in the capital.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nLuxembourg is divided into 12 cantons, which are further divided into 102 communes. Twelve of the communes have city status; the city of Luxembourg is the largest.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nLuxembourg has long been a prominent supporter of European political and economic integration. In 1921, Luxembourg and Belgium formed the Belgium\u2013Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) to create a regime of inter-exchangeable currency and a common customs, foreshadowing later efforts at European integration. Luxembourg is a member of the Benelux Economic Union and was one of the founding members of the European Economic Community (now the European Union). It also participates in the Schengen Group (named after the Luxembourg village of Schengen where the agreements were signed), whose goal is the free movement of citizens among member states. At the same time, the majority of Luxembourgers have consistently believed that European unity makes sense only in the context of a dynamic transatlantic relationship, and thus have traditionally pursued a pro-NATO, pro-US foreign policy.Luxembourg is the site of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Statistical Office of the European Communities (\"Eurostat\") and other vital EU organs. The Secretariat of the European Parliament is located in Luxembourg, but the Parliament usually meets in Brussels and sometimes in Strasbourg.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nThe Army is situated on the \"H\u00e4rebierg\" which is Luxemburgish and translates to \"men's mountain\". The army is under civilian control, with the Grand Duke as Commander-in-Chief. The Minister for Defence, currently Fran\u00e7ois Bausch, oversees army operations. The professional head of the army is the Chief of Defence, who answers to the minister and holds the rank of general.\nBeing a landlocked country, it has no navy. Luxembourg also lacks an air force, though the 17 NATO AWACS aeroplanes are, for convenience, registered as aircraft of Luxembourg. In accordance with a joint agreement with Belgium, both countries have put forth funding for one A400M military cargo plane.Luxembourg has participated in the Eurocorps, has contributed troops to the UNPROFOR and IFOR missions in former Yugoslavia, and has participated with a small contingent in the current NATO SFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Luxembourg troops have also deployed to Afghanistan, to support ISAF. The army has also participated in humanitarian relief missions such as setting up refugee camps for Kurds and providing emergency supplies to Albania.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLuxembourg is one of the smallest countries in Europe, and ranked 167th in size of all the 194 independent countries of the world; the country is about 2,586 square kilometres (998 sq mi) in size, and measures 82 km (51 mi) long and 57 km (35 mi) wide. It lies between latitudes 49\u00b0 and 51\u00b0 N, and longitudes 5\u00b0 and 7\u00b0 E.\n\nTo the east, Luxembourg borders the German Bundesl\u00e4nder of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, and to the south, it borders the French r\u00e9gion of Grand Est (Lorraine). The Grand Duchy borders the Belgian Walloon Region, in particular the latter's provinces of Luxembourg and Li\u00e8ge, part of which comprises the German-speaking Community of Belgium, to the west and to the north, respectively.\nThe northern third of the country is known as the 'Oesling', and forms part of the Ardennes. It is dominated by hills and low mountains, including the Kneiff near Wilwerdange, which is the highest point, at 560 metres (1,837 ft). Other mountains are the 'Buurgplaaz' at 559 metres near Huldange and the 'Napol\u00e9onsgaard' at 554 metres near Rambrouch. The region is sparsely populated, with only one town (Wiltz) with a population of more than four thousand people.\nThe southern two-thirds of the country is called the \"Gutland\", and is more densely populated than the Oesling. It is also more diverse and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.\n\nThe border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz. The valleys of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.\nAccording to the 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Luxembourg is one of the world's best performers in environmental protection, ranking 4th out of 132 assessed countries Luxembourg also ranks 6th among the top ten most livable cities in the world by Mercer's.Luxembourg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), marked by high precipitation, particularly in late summer. The summers are warm and winters cool.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nLuxembourg's stable and high-income market economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and a high level of innovation. Unemployment is traditionally low, although it had risen to 6.1% by May 2012, due largely to the effect of the 2008 global financial crisis.  In 2011, according to the IMF, Luxembourg was the second richest country in the world, with a per capita GDP on a purchasing-power parity (PPP) basis of $80,119. Its GDP per capita in purchasing power standards was 261% of the EU average (100%) in 2019. Luxembourg is ranked 13th in The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom, 26th in the United Nations Human Development Index, and 4th in the Economist Intelligence Unit's quality of life index.The industrial sector, which was dominated by steel until the 1960s, has since diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products. During the past decades, growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel production. Services, especially banking and finance, account for the majority of economic output. Luxembourg is the world's second largest investment fund centre (after the United States), the most important private banking centre in the Eurozone and Europe's leading centre for reinsurance companies. Moreover, the Luxembourg government has aimed to attract Internet start-ups, with Skype and Amazon being two of the many Internet companies that have shifted their regional headquarters to Luxembourg. Other high-tech companies have established themselves in Luxembourg, including 3D scanner developer/manufacturer Artec 3D.\nIn April 2009, concern about Luxembourg's banking secrecy laws, as well as its reputation as a tax haven, led to its being added to a \"grey list\" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by the G20. In response, the country soon after adopted OECD standards on exchange of information and was subsequently added into the category of \"jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard\". In March 2010, the Sunday Telegraph reported that most of Kim Jong-Il's $4 billion in secret accounts is in Luxembourg banks. Amazon.co.uk also benefits from Luxembourg tax loopholes by channeling substantial UK revenues as reported by The Guardian in April 2012. Luxembourg ranked third on the Tax Justice Network's 2011 Financial Secrecy Index of the world's major tax havens, scoring only slightly behind the Cayman Islands. In 2013, Luxembourg is ranked as the 2nd safest tax haven in the world, behind Switzerland.\nIn early November 2014, just days after becoming head of the European Commission, the Luxembourg's former Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker was hit by media disclosures\u2014derived from a document leak known as Luxembourg Leaks\u2014that Luxembourg under his premiership had turned into a major European centre of corporate tax avoidance.Agriculture employed about 2.1% percent of Luxembourg's active population in 2010, when there were 2200 agricultural holdings with an average area per holding of 60 hectares.Luxembourg has especially close trade and financial ties to Belgium and the Netherlands (see Benelux), and as a member of the EU it enjoys the advantages of the open European market.\nWith $171 billion in May 2015, the country ranks eleventh in the world in holdings of U.S. Treasury securities. However, securities owned by non-Luxembourg residents, but held in custodial accounts in Luxembourg, are also included in this figure.As of 2019, public debt of Luxembourg was at $15,687,000,000, or a per capita debt of $25,554. The debt to GDP was 22.10%.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nLuxembourg has road, rail and air transport facilities and services. The road network has been significantly modernised in recent years with 147 km (91 mi) of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway station and a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport was opened in 2008. Luxembourg city reintroduced trams in December 2017 and there are plans to open light-rail lines in adjacent areas within the next few years.\nThe number of cars per 1000 persons amount to 680.1 in Luxembourg \u2014 higher than all but two states, namely the Principality of Monaco and the British overseas territory of Gibraltar.On 29 February 2020 Luxembourg became the first country to introduce no-charge public transportation which will be almost completely funded through tax revenue.\n\n\n=== Communications ===\n\nThe telecommunications industry in Luxembourg is liberalised and the electronic communications networks are significantly developed. Competition between the different operators is guaranteed by the legislative framework Paquet Telecom of the Government of 2011 which transposes the European Telecom Directives into Luxembourgish law. This encourages the investment in networks and services. The regulator ILR \u2013 Institut Luxembourgeois de R\u00e9gulation ensures the compliance to these legal rules.\nLuxembourg has modern and widely deployed optical fiber and cable networks throughout the country. In 2010, the Luxembourg Government launched its National strategy for very high-speed networks with the aim to become a global leader in terms of very high-speed broadband by achieving full 1 Gbit/s coverage of the country by 2020. In 2011, Luxembourg had an NGA coverage of 75%. In April 2013 Luxembourg featured the 6th highest download speed worldwide and the 2nd highest in Europe: 32,46 Mbit/s. The country's location in Central Europe, stable economy and low taxes favour the telecommunication industry.It ranks 2nd in the world in the development of the Information and Communication Technologies in the ITU ICT Development Index and 8th in the Global Broadband Quality Study 2009 by the University of Oxford and the University of Oviedo.\n\nLuxembourg is connected to all major European Internet Exchanges (AMS-IX Amsterdam, DE-CIX Frankfurt, LINX London), datacenters and POPs through redundant optical networks. In addition, the country is connected to the virtual meetme room services (vmmr) of the international data hub operator Ancotel. This enables Luxembourg to interconnect with all major telecommunication operators and data carriers worldwide. The interconnection points are in Frankfurt, London, New York and Hong Kong. Luxembourg has established itself as one of the leading financial technology (FinTech) hubs in Europe, with the Luxembourg government supporting initiatives like the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology.Some 20 data centres are operating in Luxembourg. Six data centers are Tier IV Design certified: three of ebrc, two of LuxConnect and one of European Data Hub. In a survey on nine international data centers carried out in December 2012 and January 2013 and measuring availability (up-time) and performance (delay by which the data from the requested website was received), the top three positions were held by Luxembourg data centers.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Largest towns ===\n\n\n=== Ethnicity ===\nThe people of Luxembourg are called Luxembourgers. The immigrant population increased in the 20th century due to the arrival of immigrants from Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and Portugal, with the majority coming from the latter: in 2013 there were about 88,000 inhabitants with Portuguese nationality. In 2013, there were 537,039 permanent residents, 44.5% of which were of foreign background or foreign nationals; the largest foreign ethnic groups were the Portuguese, comprising 16.4% of the total population, followed by the French (6.6%), Italians (3.4%), Belgians (3.3%) and Germans (2.3%). Another 6.4% were of other EU background, while the remaining 6.1% were of other non-EU, but largely other European, background.Since the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, Luxembourg has seen many immigrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia. Annually, over 10,000 new immigrants arrive in Luxembourg, mostly from the EU states, as well as Eastern Europe. In 2000 there were 162,000 immigrants in Luxembourg, accounting for 37% of the total population. There were an estimated 5,000 illegal immigrants in Luxembourg in 1999.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe linguistic situation of Luxembourg is characterized by the existence of a language specific to the local population (Luxembourgish), which is partially mutually intelligible with the neighboring High German, as well as the historical presence of the French and German languages.\nThree languages are recognised as official in Luxembourg: French, German and Luxembourgish, a Franconian language of the Moselle region that is also spoken in neighbouring parts of Belgium, Germany and France. Though Luxembourgish is part of the West Central German group of High German languages, more than 5,000 words in the language are of French origin. The first printed sentences in Luxembourgish appeared in a weekly journal, the Luxemburger Wochenblatt, in the second edition on 14 April 1821.\nApart from being one of the three official languages, Luxembourgish is also considered the national language of the Grand Duchy; it is the mother tongue or \"language of the heart\" for the local population. \nEvery citizen or resident has the right to address the administration in the language of their choice among the three official languages and to be answered in that language.\nDue to the historical influence of the Napoleonic Code on the legal system of the Grand Duchy, French is the sole language of the legislation. French is generally the preferred language of the government, administration and justice. The parliamentary debates are however mostly conducted in Luxembourgish, whereas the written government communications and the official documents (e.g. administrative or judicial decisions, passports etc.) are drafted only in French.\nEach of the three languages is used as the primary language in certain spheres of everyday life, without being exclusive. Luxembourgish is the language that Luxembourgers generally use to speak to each other, but it is seldom used as written language and the numerous expatriate workers (approximately 60% of the population) generally do not use it to speak to each other. Since the 1980s, however, an increasing number of novels have been written in Luxembourgish. Most official business is carried out in French. German is very often used in much of the media along with French. French is mostly used for written communications to the public (written official statements, advertising displays, road signs etc. are generally in French).\nA 2009 survey pointed out that French was the language spoken by most inhabitants (99%), followed by Luxembourgish (82%), German (81%), and English (72%).Although professional life is largely multilingual, French is described by private sector business leaders as the main working language of their companies (56%), followed by Luxembourgish (20%), English (18%), and German (6%).Due to the large community of Portuguese origin, the Portuguese language is de facto fairly present in Luxembourg though it remains limited to the relationships inside this community; although Portuguese does not have any official status, the administration sometimes holds certain informative documents available in Portuguese.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nLuxembourg is a secular state, but the state recognises certain religions as officially mandated religions. This gives the state a hand in religious administration and appointment of clergy, in exchange for which the state pays certain running costs and wages. Currently, religions covered by such arrangements are Roman Catholicism, Judaism, Greek Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, Russian Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, Calvinism, Mennonitism, and Islam.Since 1980 it has been illegal for the government to collect statistics on religious beliefs or practices. An estimation by the CIA Factbook for the year 2000 is that 87% of Luxembourgers are Catholic, including the grand ducal family, the remaining 13% being made up of Protestants, Orthodox Christians, Jews, Muslims, and those of other or no religion. According to a 2010 Pew Research Center study, 70.4% are Christian, 2.3% Muslim, 26.8% unaffiliated, and 0.5% other religions.According to a 2005 Eurobarometer poll, 44% of Luxembourg citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", whereas 28% answered that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\", and 22% that \"they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force\".\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nLuxembourg's education system is trilingual: the first years of primary school are in Luxembourgish, before changing to German; while in secondary school, the language of instruction changes to French. Proficiency in all three languages is required for graduation from secondary school, but half the students leave school without a certified qualification, with the children of immigrants being particularly disadvantaged. In addition to the three national languages, English is taught in compulsory schooling and much of the population of Luxembourg can speak English. The past two decades have highlighted the growing importance of English in several sectors, in particular the financial sector. Portuguese, the language of the largest immigrant community, is also spoken by large segments of the population, but by relatively few from outside the Portuguese-speaking community.The University of Luxembourg is the only university based in Luxembourg. In 2014, Luxembourg School of Business, a graduate business school, has been created through private initiative and has received the accreditation from the Ministry of Higher Education and Research of Luxembourg in 2017. Two American universities maintain satellite campuses in the country, Miami University (Dolibois European Center) and Sacred Heart University (Luxembourg Campus).\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAccording to data from the World Health Organization, healthcare spending on behalf of the government of Luxembourg topped $4.1 Billion, amounting to about $8,182 for each citizen in the nation. The nation of Luxembourg collectively spent nearly 7% of its Gross Domestic Product on health, placing it among the highest spending countries on health services and related programs in 2010 among other well-off nations in Europe with high average income among its population.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nLuxembourg has been overshadowed by the culture of its neighbours. It retains a number of folk traditions, having been for much of its history a profoundly rural country. There are several notable museums, located mostly in the capital. These include the National Museum of History and Art (NMHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, and the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam). The National Museum of Military History (MNHM) in Diekirch is especially known for its representations of the Battle of the Bulge. The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications.The country has produced some internationally known artists, including the painters Th\u00e9o Kerg, Joseph Kutter and Michel Majerus, and photographer Edward Steichen, whose The Family of Man exhibition has been placed on UNESCO's Memory of the World register, and is now permanently housed in Clervaux. Movie star Loretta Young was of Luxembourgish descent.\nLuxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders physically, psychologically, artistically and emotionally.\nLuxembourg was represented at the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China, from 1 May to 31 October 2010 with its own pavilion. The pavilion was based on the transliteration of the word Luxembourg into Chinese, \"Lu Sen Bao\", which means \"Forest and Fortress\". It represented Luxembourg as the \"Green Heart in Europe\".\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nUnlike most countries in Europe, sport in Luxembourg is not concentrated upon a particular national sport, but encompasses a number of sports, both team and individual. Despite the lack of a central sporting focus, over 100,000 people in Luxembourg, out of a total population of near 500,000\u2013600,000, are licensed members of one sports federation or another. The largest sports venue in the country is d'Coque, an indoor arena and Olympic swimming pool in Kirchberg, north-eastern Luxembourg City, which has a capacity of 8,300. The arena is used for basketball, handball, gymnastics, and volleyball, including the final of the 2007 Women's European Volleyball Championship. The national stadium (also the country's largest) is the Stade Josy Barthel, in western Luxembourg City; named after the country's only official Olympic gold medallist, the stadium has a capacity of 8,054.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nLuxembourg cuisine reflects its position on the border between the Latin and Germanic worlds, being heavily influenced by the cuisines of neighboring France and Germany. More recently, it has been enriched by its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants.\nMost native Luxembourg dishes, consumed as the traditional daily fare, share roots in the country's folk dishes the same as in neighboring Germany.\nLuxembourg sells the most alcohol in Europe per capita. However, the large proportion of alcohol purchased by customers from neighboring countries contributes to the statistically high level of alcohol sales per capita; this level of alcohol sales is thus not representative of the actual alcohol consumption of the Luxembourg population.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nThe main languages of media in Luxembourg are French and German. The newspaper with the largest circulation is the German-language daily Luxemburger Wort. Because of the strong multilingualism in Luxembourg, newspapers often alternate articles in French and articles in German, without translation. In addition there are both English and Portuguese radio and national print publications, but accurate audience figures are difficult to gauge since the national media survey by ILRES is conducted in French.\nLuxembourg is known in Europe for its radio and television stations (Radio Luxembourg and RTL Group). It is also the uplink home of SES, carrier of major European satellite services for Germany and Britain.\nDue to a 1988 law that established a special tax scheme for audiovisual investment, the film and co-production in Luxembourg has grown steadily. There are some 30 registered production companies in Luxembourg.Luxembourg won an Oscar in 2014 in the Animated Short Films category with Mr Hublot.\n\n\n=== Notable Luxembourgers ===\nList of Luxembourgers\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nOutline of Luxembourg\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Official Portal of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg\nLuxembourg from UCB Libraries GovPubs\n\"Luxembourg\".

It is located in Fishmarket, in the central Ville Haute quarter.\nThe church is the oldest extant religious site in Luxembourg City.  The first church was built on the spot in 987 as the castle chapel for the Count of Luxembourg.  However, over the following centuries, the building was destroyed, rebuilt, and renovated several times.  Its current appearance dates to 1688, and unites Romanesque and Baroque architectural styles, pre-dating the national Moselle Baroque style.  The building has been restored since then, preserving its original form; it has most recently been renovated in the 1960s, 1980s, and 2003\u20132004.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSaint Michael: Roman Catholic traditions and views\n\n\n== Footnotes ==",

          "This ordinary church has some striking modern features. Most notably the stained glass windows have been somewhat updated from the original and feature some daring modern interpretations. Lovely for a moment of reflection. (Unless you are besieged by a party of Japanese",

          "This Church, while not the Vatican holds its own in Luxembourg. The free admission to the church gives some beautiful views and some serenity. The church is active. There can be music activities at night time. Check schedules with the church. I would think outside",

He is regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, and was a member of the England team that won the 1966 FIFA World Cup, the year he also won the Ballon d'Or. He played almost all of his club football at Manchester United, where he became renowned for his attacking instincts, his passing abilities from midfield and his ferocious long-range shot, as well as his fitness and stamina. He was cautioned only twice in his career; once against Argentina in the 1966 World Cup, and once in a league match against Chelsea. His elder brother Jack, who was also in the World Cup-winning team, was a former defender for Leeds United and international manager.\nBorn in Ashington, Northumberland, Charlton made his debut for the Manchester United first-team in 1956, and over the next two seasons gained a regular place in the team, during which time he survived the Munich air disaster of 1958 after being rescued by Harry Gregg. After helping United to win the Football League First Division in 1965, he won another First Division title with United in 1967. In 1968, he captained the Manchester United team that won the European Cup, scoring two goals in the final to help them become the first English club to win the competition.\nCharlton was both Manchester United and England's long-time record goalscorer, and United's long-time record appearance maker, as well as briefly England's, until Bobby Moore overtook his 106 caps in 1973. His appearance record of 758 for United took until 2008 to be beaten, when Ryan Giggs did so in that year's Champions League final. With 249 goals, he is currently United's second all-time leading goalscorer, after his record was surpassed by Wayne Rooney in 2017. He is also the second highest goalscorer for England, after his record of 49 goals which was held until 2015 was again surpassed by Rooney.\nHe was named in the England squad for four World Cups (1958, 1962, 1966 and 1970), though did not play in the first. At the time of his retirement from the England team in 1970, he was the nation's most capped player, having turned out 106 times at the highest level. This record has since been surpassed by six players (as of November 2019).\nHe left Manchester United to become manager of Preston North End for the 1973\u201374 season. He changed to player-manager the following season. He next accepted a post as a director with Wigan Athletic, then became a member of Manchester United's board of directors in 1984 and remains one as of the 2018\u201319 season.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCharlton was born in Ashington, Northumberland, England on 11 October 1937 to coal mining worker Robert Wallace \"Bob\" Charlton (11 September 1909 \u2013 21 December 1983) and teacher Elizabeth Ellen \"Cissie\" Charlton (n\u00e9e Milburn) (11 November 1912 \u2013 25 March 1996). He is related to several professional footballers on his mother's side of the family: his uncles were Jack Milburn (Leeds United and Bradford City), George Milburn (Leeds United and Chesterfield), Jim Milburn (Leeds United and Bradford City) and Stan Milburn (Chesterfield, Leicester City and Rochdale), and legendary Newcastle United and England footballer Jackie Milburn, was his mother's cousin. However, Charlton credits much of the early development of his career to his grandfather Tanner and his mother Cissie. His elder brother, Jack, initially worked as a miner before applying to the police, only to also become a professional footballer with Leeds United.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nOn 9 February 1953, then a Bedlington Grammar School pupil, Charlton was spotted playing for East Northumberland schools by Manchester United chief scout Joe Armstrong. Charlton went on to play for England Schoolboys and the 15-year-old signed with United on 1 January 1953, along with Wilf McGuinness, also aged 15. Initially his mother was reluctant to let him commit to an insecure football career, so he began an apprenticeship as an electrical engineer; however, he went on to turn professional in October 1954.Charlton became one of the famed Busby Babes, the collection of talented footballers who emerged through the system at Old Trafford in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s as Matt Busby set about a long-term plan of rebuilding the club after the Second World War. He worked his way through the pecking order of teams, scoring regularly for the youth and reserve sides before he was handed his first team debut against Charlton Athletic in October 1956. At the same time, he was doing his National service with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in Shrewsbury, where Busby had advised him to apply as it meant he could still play for Manchester United at the weekend. Also doing his army service in Shrewsbury at the same time was his United teammate Duncan Edwards.Charlton played 14 times for United in that first season, scoring twice on his debut and managing a total of 12 goals in all competitions, and including a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 away win over Charlton Athletic in the February. United won the league championship but were denied the 20th century's first \"double\" when they controversially lost the 1957 FA Cup Final to Aston Villa. Charlton, still only 19, was selected for the game, which saw United goalkeeper Ray Wood carried off with a broken cheekbone after a clash with Villa centre forward Peter McParland. Though Charlton was a candidate to go in goal to replace Wood (in the days before substitutes, and certainly before goalkeeping substitutes), it was teammate Jackie Blanchflower who ended up between the posts.\nCharlton was an established player by the time the next season was fully underway, which saw United, as current League champions, become the first English team to compete in the European Cup. Previously, the Football Association had scorned the competition, but United made progress, reaching the semi-finals where they lost to holders Real Madrid. Their reputation was further enhanced the next season as they reached the quarter finals to play Red Star Belgrade. In the first leg at home, United won 2\u20131. The return in Yugoslavia saw Charlton score twice as United stormed 3\u20130 ahead, although the hosts came back to earn a 3\u20133 draw. However, United maintained their aggregate lead to reach the last four and were in jubilant mood as they left to catch their flight home, thinking of an important League game against Wolves at the weekend.\n\n\n=== Munich air disaster ===\n\nThe aeroplane which took the United players and staff home from Zemun Airport needed to stop in Munich to refuel. This was carried out in worsening weather, and by the time the refuelling was complete and the call was made for the passengers to re-board the aircraft, the wintry showers had taken hold and snow had settled heavily on the runway and around the airport. There were two aborted take-offs which led to concern on board, and the passengers were advised by a stewardess to disembark again while a minor technical error was fixed.\nThe team was back in the airport terminal barely ten minutes when the call to reconvene on the plane came, and a number of passengers began to feel nervous. Charlton and teammate Dennis Viollet swapped places with Tommy Taylor and David Pegg, who had decided they would be safer at the back of the plane.\nThe plane clipped the fence at the end of the runway on its next take-off attempt and a wing tore through a nearby house, setting it alight. The wing and part of the tail came off and hit a tree and a wooden hut, the plane spinning along the snow until coming to a halt. It had been cut in half.\nCharlton, strapped into his seat, had fallen out of the cabin and when United goalkeeper Harry Gregg (who had somehow got through a hole in the plane unscathed and begun a one-man rescue mission) found him, he thought he was dead. That said, he grabbed both Charlton and Viollet by their trouser waistbands and dragged them away from the plane in constant fear that it would explode. Gregg returned to the plane to try to help the appallingly injured Busby and Blanchflower, and when he turned around again, he was relieved to see that Charlton and Viollet, both of whom he had presumed to be dead, had got out of their detached seats and were looking into the wreckage.\nCharlton suffered cuts to his head and severe shock and was in hospital for a week. Seven of his teammates had perished at the scene, including Taylor and Pegg, with whom he and Viollet had swapped seats prior to the fatal take-off attempt. Club captain Roger Byrne was also killed, along with Mark Jones, Billy Whelan, Eddie Colman and Geoff Bent. Duncan Edwards died a fortnight later from the injuries he had sustained. In total, the crash claimed 23 lives. Initially, ice on the wings was blamed, but a later inquiry declared that slush on the runway had made a safe take-off almost impossible.\nOf the 44 passengers and crew (including the 17-strong Manchester United squad), 23 people (eight of them Manchester United players) died as a result of their injuries in the crash. Charlton survived with minor injuries. Of the eight other players who survived, two of them were injured so badly that they never played again.\nCharlton was the first injured survivor to leave hospital. Harry Gregg and Bill Foulkes were not hospitalised since they escaped uninjured. He arrived back in England on 14 February 1958, eight days after the crash. As he convalesced with family in Ashington, he spent some time kicking a ball around with local youths, and a famous photograph of him was taken. He was still only 20 years old, yet now there was an expectation that he would help with the rebuilding of the club as Busby's aides tried to piece together what remained of the season.\n\n\n=== Resuming his career ===\nCharlton returned to playing in an FA cup tie against West Bromwich Albion on 1 March; the game was a draw and United won the replay 1\u20130. Not unexpectedly, United went out of the European Cup to Milan in the semi-finals to a 5\u20132 aggregate defeat and fell behind in the League. Yet somehow they reached their second consecutive FA Cup final, and the big day at Wembley coincided with Busby's return to work. However, his words could not inspire a side which was playing on a nation's goodwill and sentiment, and Nat Lofthouse scored twice to give Bolton Wanderers a 2\u20130 win.\nFurther success with Manchester United came at last when they beat Leicester City 3\u20131 in the FA Cup final of 1963, with Charlton finally earning a winners' medal in his third final. Busby's post-Munich rebuilding programme continued to progress with two League championships within three seasons, with United taking the title in 1965 and 1967. A successful (though trophyless) season with Manchester United had seen him take the honours of Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year and European Footballer of the Year into the competition.\nIn 1968, Manchester United reached the European Cup final, ten seasons after Munich. Even though other clubs had taken part in the competition in the intervening decade, the team which got to this final was still the first English side to do so. On a highly emotional night at Wembley, Charlton scored twice in a 4\u20131 win after extra time against Benfica and, as United captain, lifted the trophy.\nDuring the early 1970s, Manchester United were no longer competing among the top teams in England, and at several stages were battling against relegation. At times, Charlton was not on speaking terms with United's other superstars George Best and Denis Law, and Best refused to play in Charlton's testimonial match against Celtic, saying that \"to do so would be hypocritical\". Charlton left Manchester United at the end of the 1972\u201373 season, having scored 249 goals and set a club record of 758 appearances, a record which Ryan Giggs broke in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final.\nHis last game for Manchester United was against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 28 April 1973, and before the game the BBC cameras for Match of the Day captured the Chelsea chairman handing Charlton a commemorative cigarette case. The match ended in a 1\u20130 defeat. His final goal for the club came a month earlier, on 31 March, in a 2\u20130 win at Southampton, also in the First Division.He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1969 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at The Sportsman's Club in central London.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\nCharlton's emergence as the country's leading young football talent was completed when he was called up to join the England squad for a British Home Championship game against Scotland at Hampden Park on 19 April 1958, just over two months after he had survived the Munich air disaster.\nCharlton was handed his debut as England romped home 4\u20130, with the new player gaining even more admirers after scoring a magnificent thumping volley dispatched with authority after a cross by the left winger Tom Finney. He scored both goals in his second game as England beat Portugal 2\u20131 in a friendly at Wembley; and overcame obvious nerves on a return to Belgrade to play his third match against Yugoslavia. England lost that game 5\u20130 and Charlton played poorly.\n\n\n=== 1958 World Cup ===\nCharlton was selected for the squad which competed at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, but he did not play.In 1959 he scored a hat-trick as England demolished the US 8\u20131; and his second England hat-trick came in 1961 in an 8\u20130 thrashing of Mexico. He also managed to score in every British Home Championship tournament he played in except 1963 in an association with the tournament that lasted from 1958 to 1970 and included 16 goals and 10 tournament victories (five shared).\n\n\n=== 1962 World Cup ===\nHe played in qualifiers for the 1962 World Cup in Chile against Luxembourg and Portugal and was named in the squad for the finals themselves. His goal in the 3\u20131 group win over Argentina was his 25th for England in just 38 appearances, and he was still only 24 years old, but his individual success could not be replicated by that of the team, which was eliminated in the quarter final by Brazil, who went on to win the tournament.\n\nBy now, England were coached by Alf Ramsey who had managed to gain sole control of the recruitment and team selection procedure from the committee-based call-up system which had lasted up to the previous World Cup. Ramsey had already cleared out some of the older players who had been reliant on the loyalty of the committee for their continued selection. A hat-trick in the 8\u20131 rout of Switzerland in June 1963 took Charlton's England goal tally to 30, equalling the record jointly held by Tom Finney and Nat Lofthouse and Charlton's 31st goal against Wales in October the same year gave him the record alone.\nCharlton's role was developing from traditional inside-forward to what today would be termed an attacking midfield player, with Ramsey planning to build the team for the 1966 World Cup around him. When England beat the USA 10\u20130 in a friendly on 27 May 1964, he scored one goal, his 33rd at senior level for England.His goals became a little less frequent, and indeed Jimmy Greaves, playing purely as a striker, would overtake Charlton's England tally in October 1964. Nevertheless, he was still scoring and creating freely and as the tournament was about to start, he was expected to become one of its stars and galvanise his established reputation as one of the world's best footballers.\n\n\n=== 1966 World Cup ===\nEngland drew the opening game of the tournament 0\u20130 with Uruguay. Charlton scored the first goal in the 2\u20130 win over Mexico. This was followed by an identical scoreline against France, allowing England to qualify for the quarter finals.\nEngland defeated Argentina 1\u20130. The game was the only international match in which Charlton received a caution. They faced Portugal in the semi-finals. This turned out to be one of Charlton's most important games for England.\nCharlton opened the scoring with a crisp side-footed finish after a run by Roger Hunt had forced the Portuguese goalkeeper out of his net; his second was a sweetly struck shot after a run and pull-back from Geoff Hurst. Charlton and Hunt were now England's joint-highest scorers in the tournament with three each, and a final against West Germany beckoned.\nThe final turned out to be one of Charlton's quieter days; he and a young Franz Beckenbauer effectively marked each other out of the game. England won 4\u20132 after extra time.\n\n\n=== Euro 1968 ===\nCharlton's next England game was his 75th as England beat Northern Ireland; 2 caps later and he had become England's second most-capped player, behind the veteran Billy Wright, who was approaching his 100th appearance when Charlton was starting out and ended with 105 caps.\nWeeks later he scored his 45th England goal in a friendly against Sweden, breaking the record of 44 set the previous year by Jimmy Greaves. He was then in the England team which made it to the semi-finals of the 1968 European Championships where they were knocked out by Yugoslavia in Florence. During the match Charlton struck a Yugoslav post. England defeated the Soviet Union 2\u20130 in the third place match.\n\nIn 1969, Charlton was appointed an OBE for services to football. More milestones followed as he won his 100th England cap on 21 April 1970 against Northern Ireland, and was made captain by Ramsey for the occasion. Inevitably, he scored. This was his 48th goal for his country \u2013 his 49th and final goal followed a month later in a 4\u20130 win over Colombia during a warm-up tour for the 1970 World Cup, designed to get the players adapted to altitude conditions. Charlton's inevitable selection by Ramsey for the tournament made him the first \u2013 and still, to date, only \u2013 England player to feature in four World Cup squads.\n\n\n=== 1970 World Cup ===\nShortly before the World Cup, Charlton was involved in the Bogot\u00e1 Bracelet incident in which he and Bobby Moore were accused of stealing a bracelet from a jewellery store. Moore was later arrested and detained for four days before being granted a conditional release, while Charlton was not arrested.\nEngland began the tournament with two victories in the group stages, plus a memorable defeat against Brazil. Charlton played in all three, though was substituted for Alan Ball in the final game of the group against Czechoslovakia. Ramsey, confident of victory and progress to the quarter-final, wanted Charlton to rest.\n\nEngland reached the last eight where they again faced West Germany. Charlton controlled the midfield and suppressed Franz Beckenbauer's runs from deep. England took a 2\u20130 lead in the 50th minute after goals from Alan Mullery and Martin Peters. In the 69th minute, Beckenbauer pulled a goal back for the Germans and Ramsey soon replaced Charlton with Colin Bell, who further tested the German goalkeeper Sepp Maier and also provided a cross for Geoff Hurst, who missed a chance to score. West Germany, who had a habit of coming back from behind, eventually scored twice \u2013 a back header from Uwe Seeler made it 2\u20132. In extra-time, Geoff Hurst had a goal mysteriously ruled out after which Gerd M\u00fcller's goal won the match 3\u20132. England were out and, after a record 106 caps and 49 goals, Charlton decided to end his international career at the age of 32. On the flight home from Mexico, he asked Ramsey not to consider him again. His brother Jack, two years his senior but 71 caps his junior, did likewise.\nCharlton's caps record lasted until 1973 when Bobby Moore overtook him, and he currently lies seventh in the all-time England appearances list behind Moore, Wayne Rooney, Ashley Cole, Steven Gerrard, David Beckham and Peter Shilton, whose own England career began in the first game after Charlton's had ended. Charlton's goalscoring record was surpassed by Wayne Rooney on 8 September 2015, when Rooney scored a penalty in a 2\u20130 win over Switzerland in a qualifying match for UEFA Euro 2016.\n\n\n== Management career and directorships ==\n\nCharlton became the manager of Preston North End in 1973, signing his former United and England teammate Nobby Stiles as player-coach. His first season ended in relegation and although he began playing again he left Preston early in the 1975\u201376 season after a disagreement with the board over the transfer of John Bird to Newcastle United. He was appointed a CBE that year and began a casual association with BBC for punditry on matches, which continued for many years. In early 1976, he scored once in three league appearances for Waterford United. He also made a handful of appearances for Australian clubs Newcastle KB United, Perth Azzurri and Blacktown City.He joined Wigan Athletic as a director, and was briefly caretaker manager there in 1983. He then spent some time playing in South Africa. He also built up several businesses in areas such as travel, jewellery and hampers, and ran soccer schools in the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and China. In 1984, he was invited to become member of the board of directors at Manchester United, partly because of his football knowledge and partly because it was felt that the club needed a \"name\" on the board after the resignation of Sir Matt Busby. He remains a director of Manchester United as of 2018 and his continued presence was a factor in placating many fans opposed to the club's takeover by Malcolm Glazer.\n\n\n== Personal life and retirement ==\nCharlton met his wife, Norma Ball, at an ice rink in Manchester in 1959 and they married in 1961. They have two daughters \u2013 Suzanne and Andrea. Suzanne was a weather forecaster for the BBC during the 1990s. They now have grandchildren, including Suzanne's son Robert, who is named in honour of his grandfather.In 2007, while publicising his forthcoming autobiography, Charlton revealed that he had a long-running feud with his brother, Jack. They have rarely spoken since a falling-out between his wife Norma and his mother Cissie (who died on 25 March 1996 at the age of 83). Charlton did not see his mother after 1992 as a result of the feud.Jack presented him with his BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award on 14 December 2008. He said that he was 'knocked out' as he was presented the award by his brother. He received a standing ovation as he stood waiting for his prize.Charlton helped to promote Manchester's bids for the 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games and the 2002 Commonwealth Games, England's bid for the 2006 World Cup and London's successful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. He received a knighthood in 1994 and was an Inaugural Inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002. On accepting his award he commented \"I'm really proud to be included in the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. It's a great honour. If you look at the names included I have to say I couldn't argue with them. They are all great players and people I would love to have played with.\" He is also the (honorary) president of the National Football Museum, an organisation about which he said \"I can't think of a better museum anywhere in the world.\"\nOn 2 March 2009, Charlton was given the freedom of the city of Manchester, stating \"I'm just so proud, it's fantastic. It's a great city. I have always been very proud of it.\"Charlton is involved in a number of charitable activities including fund raising for cancer hospitals. Charlton became involved in the cause of land mine clearance after visits to Bosnia and Cambodia and supports the Mines Advisory Group as well as founding his own charity Find a Better Way which funds research into improved civilian landmine clearance.In January 2011, Charlton was voted the fourth greatest Manchester United player of all time by the readers of Inside United and ManUtd.com, behind Ryan Giggs (who topped the poll), Eric Cantona and George Best.He is a member of the Laureus World Sports Academy. On 6 February 2012 Charlton was taken to hospital after falling ill, and subsequently had a gallstone removed. This prevented him from collecting a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Laureus World Sports Awards.On 15 February 2016, Manchester United announced the South Stand of Old Trafford would be renamed in honour of Sir Bobby Charlton. The unveiling took place at the home game against Everton on 3 April 2016.In October 2017, Charlton had a pitch named after him at St George's Park.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the episode \"Taking Liberties\" of the sitcom Frasier, Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves) mentions that one of her uncles tried fanatically to get Charlton's autograph, \"until Bobby cracked him over the head with a can of lager. Twelve stitches, and he still has the can!\"\nIn the 2011 film United, centred on the successes of the Busby Babes and the decimation of the team in the Munich crash, Charlton was portrayed by actor Jack O'Connell.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\n\n\n=== International ===\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nSource:\nManchester UnitedFootball League First Division (3): 1956\u201357, 1964\u201365, 1966\u201367\nFA Cup: 1962\u201363\nCharity Shield (4): 1956, 1957, 1965, 1967\nEuropean Cup: 1967\u201368\nFA Youth Cup (3): 1953\u201354, 1954\u201355, 1955\u201356\n\n\n=== International ===\nSource:\nEnglandFIFA World Cup: 1966\nUEFA European Championship third place: 1968\nBritish Home Championship (10): 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970\n\n\n=== Individual ===\nSource:\nFWA Footballer of the Year: 1965\u201366\nFIFA World Cup Golden Ball: 1966\nFIFA World Cup All-Star Team (2): 1966, 1970\nBallon d'Or: 1966\nBallon d'Or (2nd place): 1967, 1968\nPFA Merit Award: 1974\nFWA Tribute Award: 1989\nFIFA World Cup All-Time Team: 1994\nFootball League 100 Legends: 1998\nEnglish Football Hall of Fame: 2002\nFIFA 100: 2004\nUEFA Golden Jubilee Poll: 14th\nPFA England League Team of the Century (1907 to 2007):\nTeam of the Century 1907-1976\nOverall Team of the Century\nBBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award: 2008\nUEFA President's Award: 2008\nLaureus Lifetime Achievement Award: 2012\nFIFA Player of the Century:\nFIFA internet vote: 16th\nIFFHS vote: 10th\nWorld Soccer The Greatest Players of the 20th century: 12th\nIFFHS Legends\n\n\n=== Orders and special awards ===\nOfficer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE): 1969\nCommander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE): 1974\nKnight Bachelor: 1994\nOrder of the Rising Sun, 4th class: 2012\n\n\n== References ==\nCrick, Michael; Smith, David (1990).

        "wiki": "Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: L\u00ebtzebuerg, French: Luxembourg, German: Luxemburg), also known as Luxembourg City (Luxembourgish: Stad L\u00ebtzebuerg or d'Stad, French: Ville de Luxembourg, German: Stadt Luxemburg, Luxemburg-Stadt), is the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the country's most populous commune. Standing at the confluence of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers in southern Luxembourg, the city lies at the heart of Western Europe, situated 213 km (132 mi) by road from Brussels, 372 km (231 mi) from Paris, and 209 km (130 mi) from Cologne. The city contains Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.\nAs of 31 December 2019, Luxembourg City has a population of 122,273 inhabitants, which is more than three times the population of the country's second most populous commune (Esch-sur-Alzette). The city's population consists of 160 nationalities. Foreigners represent 70% of the city's population, while Luxembourgers represent 30% of the population, and the number of foreign-born residents in the city rises steadily each year.In 2011, Luxembourg was ranked as having the second-highest per capita GDP in the world at $80,119 (PPP), with the city having developed into a banking and administrative centre. In the 2011 Mercer worldwide survey of 221 cities, Luxembourg was placed first for personal safety, while it was ranked 19th for quality of living.Luxembourg is one of the de facto capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg), as it is the seat of several institutions, agencies, and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, and Eurostat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Roman era, a fortified tower guarded the crossing of two Roman roads that met at the site of Luxembourg city. Through an exchange treaty with the abbey of Saint Maximin in Trier in 963, Siegfried I of the Ardennes, a close relative of King Louis II of France and Emperor Otto the Great, acquired the feudal lands of Luxembourg. Siegfried built his castle, named Lucilinburhuc (\"small castle\"), on the Bock Fiels (\"rock\"), mentioned for the first time in the aforementioned exchange treaty.\nIn 987, Archbishop Egbert of Trier consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael's Church). At a Roman road intersection near the church, a marketplace appeared around which the city developed.\nThe city, because of its location and natural geography, has through history been a place of strategic military significance. The first fortifications were built as early as the 10th century. By the end of the 12th century, as the city expanded westward around the new St. Nicholas Church (today the Cathedral of Notre Dame), new walls were built that included an area of 5 hectares (12 acres). In about 1340, under the reign of John the Blind, new fortifications were built that stood until 1867.\nIn 1443, the Burgundians under Philip the Good conquered Luxembourg. Luxembourg became part of the Burgundian, and later Spanish and Austrian empires (See Spanish Netherlands and Spanish Road) and under those Habsburg administrations Luxembourg Castle was repeatedly strengthened so that by the 16th century, Luxembourg itself was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. Subsequently, the Burgundians, the Spanish, the French, the Spanish again, the Austrians, the French again, and the Prussians conquered Luxembourg.\nIn the 17th century, the first casemates were built; initially, Spain built 23 km (14 mi) of tunnels, starting in 1644. These were then enlarged under French rule by Marshal Vauban, and augmented again under Austrian rule in the 1730s and 1740s.\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, the city was occupied by France twice: once, briefly, in 1792\u20133, and, later, after a seven-month siege. Luxembourg held out for so long under the French siege that French politician and military engineer Lazare Carnot called Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city's nickname: the 'Gibraltar of the North'.Nonetheless, the Austrian garrison eventually surrendered, and as a consequence, Luxembourg was annexed by the French Republic, becoming part of the d\u00e9partement of For\u00eats, with Luxembourg City as its pr\u00e9fecture. Under the 1815 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars, Luxembourg City was placed under Prussian military control as a part of the German Confederation, although sovereignty passed to the House of Orange-Nassau, in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis, the 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg to dismantle the fortifications in Luxembourg City. Their demolition took sixteen years, cost 1.5 million gold francs, and required the destruction of over 24 km (15 mi) of underground defences and 4 hectares (9.9 acres) of casemates, batteries, barracks, etc. Furthermore, the Prussian garrison was to be withdrawn.\n\nWhen, in 1890, Grand Duke William III died without any male heirs, the Grand Duchy passed out of Dutch hands, and into an independent line under Grand Duke Adolphe. Thus, Luxembourg, which had hitherto been independent in theory only, became a truly independent country, and Luxembourg City regained some of the importance that it had lost in 1867 by becoming the capital of a fully independent state.\nDespite Luxembourg's best efforts to remain neutral in the First World War, it was occupied by Germany on 2 August 1914. On 30 August, Helmuth von Moltke moved his headquarters to Luxembourg City, closer to his armies in France in preparation for a swift victory. However, the victory never came, and Luxembourg would play host to the German high command for another four years. At the end of the occupation, Luxembourg City was the scene of an attempted communist revolution; on 9 November 1918, communists declared a socialist republic, but it lasted only a few hours.In 1921, the city limits were greatly expanded. The communes of Eich, Hamm, Hollerich, and Rollingergrund were incorporated into Luxembourg City, making the city the largest commune in the country (a position that it would hold until 1978).\nIn 1940, Germany occupied Luxembourg again. The Nazis were not prepared to allow Luxembourgers self-government, and gradually integrated Luxembourg into the Third Reich by informally attaching the country administratively to a neighbouring German province. Under the occupation, the capital city's streets all received new, German names, which was announced on 4 October 1940. The Avenue de la Libert\u00e9 for example, a major road leading to the railway station, was renamed \"Adolf-Hitlerstra\u00dfe\". Luxembourg City was liberated on 10 September 1944. The city was under long-range bombardment by the German V-3 cannon in December 1944 and January 1945.\nAfter the war, Luxembourg ended its neutrality, and became a founding member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the European Parliament until 1981. Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Investment Bank. Several departments of the European Commission are also based in Luxembourg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe highest point of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is Kneiff at 560 m, closely followed by Burgplatz at 559 m and Napoleonsgaart at 554 m.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLuxembourg City lies on the southern part of the Luxembourg plateau, a large Early Jurassic sandstone formation that forms the heart of the Gutland, a low-lying and flat area that covers the southern two-thirds of the country.\nThe city centre occupies a picturesque site on a salient, perched high on precipitous cliffs that drop into the narrow valleys of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers, whose confluence is in Luxembourg City. The 70 m (230 ft) deep gorges cut by the rivers are spanned by many bridges and viaducts, including the Adolphe Bridge, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and the Passerelle. Although Luxembourg City is not particularly large, its layout is complex, as the city is set on several levels, straddling hills and dropping into the two gorges.\nThe commune of Luxembourg City covers an area of over 51 km2 (20 sq mi), or 2% of the Grand Duchy's total area. This makes the city the fourth-largest commune in Luxembourg, and by far the largest urban area. Luxembourg City is not particularly densely populated, at about 1,700 people per km2; large areas of Luxembourg City are maintained as parks, forested areas, or sites of important heritage (particularly the UNESCO sites), while there are also large tracts of farmland within the city limits.\n\n\n=== Quarters of Luxembourg City ===\n\nLuxembourg City is subdivided into twenty-four quarters (French: quartiers), which cover the commune in its entirety. The quarters generally correspond to the major neighbourhoods and suburbs of Luxembourg City, although a few of the historic districts, such as Bonnevoie, are divided between two quarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nConsidering its latitude, Luxembourg City has an oceanic climate, with moderate precipitation, cold to cool winters and warm summers. Moderate to heavy cloud cover is present for more than two-thirds of the year.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nUnder the Luxembourgian constitution, local government is centred on the city's communal council. Consisting of twenty-seven members (fixed since 1964), each elected every six years on the second Sunday of October and taking office on 1 January of the next year, the council is the largest of all communal councils in Luxembourg. The city is nowadays considered a stronghold of the Democratic Party (DP), which is the second-largest party nationally. Currently, the Democratic Party is the largest party on the council, with eleven councillors.The city's administration is headed by the mayor, who is the leader of the largest party on the communal council. After Xavier Bettel became Luxembourg's new prime minister on 4 December 2013, Lydie Polfer (DP) was sworn in as new mayor of Luxembourg on 17 December of the same year. The mayor leads the cabinet, the coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal, in which the DP forms a coalition with The Greens. Unlike other cities in Luxembourg, which are limited to four \u00e9chevins at most, Luxembourg is given special dispensation to have six \u00e9chevins on its coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal.\n\n\n=== National government ===\n\nLuxembourg City is the seat for the Luxembourg Government. The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg lives at Berg Castle in Colmar-Berg.\nFor national elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the city is located in the Centre constituency.\n\n\n=== European institutions ===\nLuxembourg City is the seat of several institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank. The majority of these institutions are located in the Kirchberg quarter, in the northeast of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDespite the city's comparatively small size, it has several notable museums: the recently renovated National Museum of History and Art (MNHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam) and National Museum of Natural History (NMHN). The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications. In addition to its two main theatres, the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Capucins, there is a new concert hall, the Philharmonie, as well as a conservatory with a large auditorium. Art galleries include the Villa Vauban, the Casino Luxembourg and Am Tunnel.Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, along with the Romanian city of Sibiu, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.\nLuxembourg City is also famed for its wide selection of restaurants and cuisines, including four Michelin starred establishments.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe ING Europe Marathon has been contested annually in the capital since June 2006. It attracted 11,000 runners and over 100,000 spectators during the 2014 edition\nThe Luxembourg Open is a tennis tournament held since 1991 in the capital. The tournament runs from 13 to 21 October. BGL BNP Paribas, one of the more famous sponsors in the world of tennis, was the contracted title sponsor of the tournament until 2014.\nThe D'Coque National Sporting and Cultural Centre, in the quarter of Kirchberg, is the largest sporting venue in the country, with a capacity of 8,300 for indoor sports and swimming.\nThe two football clubs of the city of Luxembourg; Racing FC Union Luxembourg and FC RM Hamm Benfica, play in the country's highest league, the Luxembourg National Division. The 8,000-seater Stade Josy Barthel hosts the Luxembourg national football team, and CAL Spora Luxembourg, which with 400 members is the nation's largest athletics club.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nPlaces of interest include the Gothic Revival Cathedral of Notre Dame, the fortifications, the AM Tunnel (an art gallery underground), the Grand Ducal Palace, the G\u00eblle Fra war memorial, the casemates, the Neum\u00fcnster Abbey, the Place d'Armes, the Adolphe Bridge and the city hall. The city is the home of the University of Luxembourg and RTL Group.\nThe Second World War Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial is located within the city limits of Luxembourg at Hamm. This cemetery is the final resting place of 5,076 American military dead, including General George S. Patton. There is also a memorial to 371 Americans whose remains were never recovered or identified.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nLuxembourg is situated in the heart of Europe in the Gold Triangle between Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam. It is therefore connected to several motorways and international routes.\n\nA1 (E44): to Grevenmacher and Trier (Germany).\nA3 (E25): to Dudelange and Thionville (France).\nA4: to Esch-sur-Alzette and to A13 to P\u00e9tange, Athus (Belgium) and Longwy (France)\nA6 (E25 / E411): to Arlon and Brussels.\nA7 (E421): to Mersch and Ettelbruck.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nLuxembourg City is served by five rail stations operated by the state rail company, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), including the principal station and terminus of all rail lines in the Grand Duchy, Luxembourg station. Stations in Luxembourg City are served by domestic rail services operated by CFL, as well as international rail services, operated by CFL,  and German, Belgian, and French service providers. Additionally, Luxembourg station is connected to the French LGV Est network, providing high-speed services on to Paris and Strasbourg. Services to Basel and Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland are available via two daily scheduled international trains.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nLuxembourg City has a network of 31 bus routes, operated by the municipal transport authority, Autobus de la Ville de Luxembourg (AVL), partly subcontracted to private bus companies. There is also a free bus service linking the Glacis to Luxembourg station, the \"Joker Line\" for seniors, and a \"City night network\". A \"Park & Ride\"  scheme is operated by the city with five carparks connected to the bus network. In addition to AVL buses, CFL and RGTR operate regional buses to other locales in Luxembourg and nearby cities in Germany and France.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\nOn 10 December 2017, the first stage of Luxembourg City's new tram line opened between Luxexpo and the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge serving the Kirchberg quarter. An extension to the city centre (St\u00e4replaz-\u00c9toile) was opened on 27 July 2018. Further extensions to Luxembourg station, Bonnevoie, Howald, and Cloche d\u2019Or are due to be completed by 2020/21.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLuxembourg City is served by the only international airport in the country: Luxembourg Airport (codes: IATA: LUX, ICAO: ELLX). Accessibility to the airport, situated in the commune of Sandweiler, 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from the city centre, is provided via the municipal bus network, with a tram connection due to be completed by 2021. The airport is the principal hub for Luxembourg's flag carrier, Luxair, and one of the world's largest cargo airlines, Cargolux.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLuxembourg is a member of the QuattroPole union of cities, along with Trier, Saarbr\u00fccken, and Metz (neighbouring countries: Germany and France).\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nLuxembourg is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Luxembourg City\nCessange\nEurovision Song Contest 1962, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1966, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1973, held at the  Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\nEurovision Song Contest 1984, held in the Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of Luxembourg City\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMakos, Adam (2019).

        "wiki": "Luxembourg art can be traced back to Roman times, especially as depicted in statues found across the country and in the huge mosaic from Vichten. Over the centuries, Luxembourg's churches and castles have housed a number of cultural artefacts but these are nearly all ascribed to foreign artists. The first examples of art with a national flavour are paintings and maps of the City of Luxembourg and its fortifications from the end of the 16th until the beginning of the 19th century, although these too were mostly created by foreign artists. Real interest in art among the country's own citizens began in the 19th century with paintings of Luxembourg and the surroundings after the country became a grand duchy in 1815. This was followed by interest in Impressionism and Expressionism in the early 20th century, the richest period in Luxembourg painting, while Abstraction became the focus of art after the Second World War. Today there are a number of successful contemporary artists, some of whom have gained wide international recognition.\n\n\n== Antiquity ==\nA considerable number of sculptures and statues have been found in the ruins of Roman villas in various parts of Luxembourg, but the outstanding artistic treasure of the period is the Vichten mosaic which depicts the ancient Greek muses. It used to adorn the reception hall of a Roman villa in Vichten but can now be seen in Luxembourg's National Museum of History and Art. Other notable artefacts from the second century include a terracotta goblet decorated with a relief of a hunting scene found in a tomb near Mamer, a statue and a relief of the Romano-Celtic goddess Epona found at Dalheim Ricciacum, as well as bronze statues of Jupiter and Mercury.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Echternach illuminated Gospel Book ==\nThe Codex Aureus of Echternach is an early 11th-century illuminated Gospel Book containing the Vulgate versions of the four gospels. One of the most lavishly illustrated Ottonian manuscripts, it was produced at the Abbey of Echternach under the direction of Abbot Humbert. The refined Echternach style of painting is characterized by rich colouring, clear shapes and careful accentuation of the figures, interpreting the art of the Master of Trier with considerable originality. The Echternach illuminators drew on the style and iconography of much older works found in the libraries of Trier and Reichenau. The Codex Aureus is one of just two manuscripts which was kept at Echternach over the centuries, most of the others being produced for the Holy Roman Emperor Henry III. It is now in the German National Museum in Nuremberg.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Old views of Luxembourg ==\nMikal Nelson. One of the oldest works relating to the City of Luxembourg is a tinted pen-and-ink drawing of the Ch\u00e2teau Mansfeld or, more correctly, the Ch\u00e2teau de la Fontaine. The 16th-century work is attributed to the Flemish artist Tobias Verhaecht (1561\u20131631). Mansfeld was governor of Luxembourg from 1545 until his death in 1604. In 1598, Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg published the oldest known view of Luxembourg City, a copper engraving that appeared in Civitates orbis terrarum (Cologne, 1598). Half a century later, the Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu, drawing on Braun's work, published his \"Luxemburgum\" in the second volume of his Stedeboek (Amsterdam, 1649). Van der Meulen provides another view of Luxembourg from Limpertsberg where he depicts French troops taking the city in 1649.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Early Luxembourg artists ==\nIt was at the beginning of the 19th century that Luxembourg artists finally began to acquire a spirit of nationalism resulting in works emphasizing the beauty of the city and the country as a whole. Jean-Baptiste Fresez (1800\u20131867) was the most important artist of the period, remembered above all for his almost photographic images of the City of Luxembourg. Fresez also produced portraits clearly depicting not just lively facial features but also the figure's clothing including, for example, the transparency of the lace. His landscapes, which he began to publish as early as 1826, were also of considerable artistic merit. In 1855, he published his famous Album pittoresque du Grand-Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg containing extremely detailed compositions, many of them depicting Luxembourg's most beautiful views. His works are of great documentary value, especially those of the fortress of Luxembourg before it was dismantled.Nicolas Liez (1809\u20131892), who had been one of Fresez' students, was a painter, sculptor and architect. He is remembered above all for his lithographs of scenes throughout the Grand Duchy and for his oil painting of the City of Luxembourg. His collection of lithographs published in \"Voyage pittoresque \u00e0 travers le Grand Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg\" (1934) contains some of his very best work. His most famous work is his view of the City of Luxembourg from the Fetschenhof, which he drew, painted and lithographed in 1870. It shows the city when the demolition of the fortress had just begun. Despite his attempt to emphasise the fortifications by exaggerating the height of the cliffs and the railway bridge, the painting is a good representation of the city and its skyscape.Michel Engels (1851\u20131901) was an illustrator, painter and art teacher who is principally remembered for his sketches of the fortifications of Luxembourg City although he also painted a few watercolours.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Artistic visitors ==\nIn the 19th century, two well-known foreigners made important contributions to the art of Luxembourg. The first was the English Pre-impressionist painter J. M. W. Turner (1775\u20131851) who visited Luxembourg during extended study trips in 1825 and 1834 leaving many watercolours of the city and the surroundings. Victor Hugo (1802\u20131885), the French author, visited Luxembourg on several occasions. In 1871, he made a number of drawings of Luxembourg's castles, including Larochette, Schengen and especially Vianden.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== The 20th century ==\nThe first half of the 20th century was a rich period for Luxembourg art. Joseph Kutter (1894\u20131941), considered Luxembourg's most successful painter, was influenced by the Impressionists but developed his own distinctive Expressionist style. In his paintings, the subjects often stand in the foreground as if photographed. His portraits, painted with strong brushstrokes, typically show figures with excessively large noses, sometimes looking like despairing clowns, but always attracting attention. From 1918, Kutter's landscapes and floral works began to present increasingly Expressionist motifs, with intense lines and strong colours. His painting of \"Luxembourg\", commissioned for the 1937 World Exposition in Paris is a good example of his Expressionist style with the houses stacked behind one another, the cubic form of the buildings and the exaggerated strength of the fortifications, so different from J. M. W. Turner's representation of almost the same scene. Although Kutter spent a number of years in Germany, his work was most influenced by trends in France and Belgium. He was one of the founders of the Luxembourg secessionist movement.Another notable painter was the Impressionist Dominique Lang (1874\u20131919) whose paintings became increasingly uplifting, full of bright light and often depicting a young woman clothed in white. Using short brushstrokes, he would make abundant use of blues and greens. In 1912\u201313, he began to adopt the pure colouring favoured by Monet, Renoir and Pissarro. He would venture out along the banks of the River Alzette, painting scenes of orchards, flower picking and fruit harvesting or of peasants' houses in the area where he lived. His painting of Dudelange en 1917 is an excellent illustration of his characteristic aversion to industrialization. There is no sign of factories or workmen's housing in the idyllic countryside surrounding the town.\n\nNico Klopp (1894\u20131930) is remembered above all for his post-Impressionist paintings of scenes on the River Moselle. Klopp lived in Remich, where he painted many pictures of the bridge over the river. Both his landscapes and his still lifes are distinctive in their bright colouring and their solid strokes focusing firmly on the main subjects.Frantz Seimetz (1858\u20131934) was a prolific artist who painted portraits and landscapes in the Impressionist style. His most fruitful period was in Echternach, where he painted numerous scenes of the surroundings including the Mullerthal. His pictures are generally realistic and slightly romantic, bordering on Impressionism. Especially after 1900, his style became brighter and more colourful, reflecting the happiness and beauty of the moments he experienced. Today Seimetz is remembered as a conscientious artist who dominated the Luxembourg art scene for a considerable time. He was the first Luxembourger to delve into Impressionism and the first, after Nicolas Liez, to paint in the open air. He was also the first who managed to live from art alone.Sosth\u00e8ne Weis (1872-1941) painted over 5,000 watercolours, mostly of Luxembourg and its surroundings. He also worked as an architect, designing some of Luxembourg's most imposing buildings including the central post office and the Arbed building. His earlier paintings, up to 1900, show the influence of his architectural interests, as buildings are depicted with accurate but rather boring precision. Thereafter, his own romantic post-Impressionist style begins to emerge, especially in his work from 1915 to 1945. His warm colours predominate with an abundance of violets, blues and ochres. Weis mastered the art of capturing the moment, poetically reproducing the misty light of the early morning, the heat of noon or the haze gathering in the valleys at sunset. Little by little reality gave way to less precise, more suggestive images as he concentrated ever more on the essentials. He would rapidly fill out the main lines of his scenes, interpreting them more and more freely until finally his pictures revealed a world of dreams and fantasy.The sculptor Claus Cito (1882\u20131965) is remembered above all for the G\u00eblle Fra (Golden Woman) sculpture crowning the Monument of Remembrance obelisk (1923), raised in memory of the Luxembourg soldiers who died for their country in the First World War. His finest work is however considered to be the marble bust of Grand Duchess Charlotte which was completed in 1939 and now stands in the former town hall in Differdange.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Post-war contributors ==\nEmile Kirscht (1913\u20131994) worked with acrylics and gouache on paper. In 1954, he was a co-founder of the Iconomaques group of abstract artists in Luxembourg. Although Kirscht turned to abstract painting in the 1950s with works such as Composition and Automnal, it was not until the early 1960s when he substituted acrylics for oils that he truly mastered the style. One of his most notable works, Village (1959), makes use of geometrical forms to represent the internal lines and structures of the topic.Michel Stoffel (1903\u20131963), together with Joseph Kutter, is considered one of Luxembourg's most prominent painters. It was in 1950 that he first started to paint in the geometric style of abstract art, leading him in 1954 to be one of the founding members and spokesman of the Iconomaques, a group of Luxembourg artists devoted to abstract art. In 1956, he received an honorable mention at the fourth S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial. He completed two mosaics for Luxembourg's Nouvel Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e in 1962 and became a member of the arts and literature section of Grand Ducal Institute.Foni Tissen (1909\u20131975) is remembered principally for his hyperrealistic, darkly humorous paintings, many of which were self-portraits. Tissen aimed to spread art to all parts of society in order to \"elevate the spirit of man\" as he put it. While his postage stamps, posters and the logo for the emergency services have become part of Luxembourg's collective memory, his close attachment to his native Rumelange and the area's Red Rocks can be seen in his landscapes and engravings. The most typical part of his work is however the surrealist series of paintings he referred to as his Maennerscher or little men, many of them self-portraits constituting a one-man comedy. The symbols he uses guide the spectator to the extensive workings of his imagination. All in all, his work reveals his search for what he called \"the truth which is beauty and sincerity\".Gust Graas (born 1924) is a Luxembourg businessman and painter who has not only played a major role in the development of Luxembourg-based radio and television concern RTL but is also a talented abstract painter. Graas has always taken an active interest in art, producing paintings and works of sculpture. When studying in Paris, he met several Impressionist painters from the Paris School with whom he maintained contact. In 1970, he was awarded the Prix Grand-Duc Adolphe. Since his retirement in 1989, he has lived in Pollen\u00e7a on Majorca, where he has continued to paint. His exhibition Mis a\u00f1os en Espa\u00f1a (1989-2003) clearly shows how the sun and colour of the island has influenced his work.Closely associated with the post-war artists was the sculptor Lucien Wercollier whose impressive abstract works in bronze and marble can be found not just in public places in Luxembourg but in the surrounding countries too.One of the country's most successful contemporary artists is Su-Mei Tse who, in 2003, won the Golden Lion, a prize awarded to the best national participant at the Venice International Exhibition of Contemporary Art. Les balayeurs du d\u00e9sert (The Desert Sweepers), her video projection there, shows street sweepers in their distinctive Paris uniforms pointlessly sweeping away at the desert sand to the soft sound of brooms against asphalt. The second major work, \"The Echo\", also a video, depicts an Alpine scene in which a tiny figure plays the cello, the simple sounds of the instrument being reflected by the mountains.\n\n\n== Art societies ==\nLuxembourg's principal society for art is the Cercle artistique de Luxembourg, which was founded in 1893 and still thrives today. It brings together artists of all types with a view to supporting artistic work and art education. In 1926, a number of avant-gardists including Joseph Kutter and Nico Klopp founded the Luxembourg secessionist movement which presented their Expressionist works at the annual exhibitions of the Salon de la S\u00e9cession until their aspirations were reconciled with the Cercle in 1930. In 1954, a group of Abstract artists including Emile Kirscht, Michel Stoffel and Lucien Wercollier founded Iconomaques which brought modern art to Luxembourg through the important exhibitions they arranged in 1954 and 1959.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Luxembourg\nPhotography in Luxembourg\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Municipal Park (French: parc de la Ville) is a public urban park in Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg.  The eastern edge flanks the boulevard du Prince Henri and, along with the valleys of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse, forms a boundary that separates the central Ville Haute quarter from the rest of the city.\nThis green arc is segmented into separate sections by the avenue Monterey, the avenue \u00c9mile Reuter, and the avenue de la Porte-Neuve.  The area bordered by these roads is approximately 20 ha (49 acres).  The southern-most section of the park is called Edmund Klein Park (Parc Ed. Klein).  The park was created after the demolition of the fortress under the 1867 Treaty of London.The park is the location of the Villa Louvigny, in the southern-most section, and the Villa Vauban, across the avenue \u00c9mile Reuter.  The Villa Louvigny was the seat of the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de T\u00e9l\u00e9diffusion, the forerunner of RTL Group, and hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in 1962 and 1966.  The Villa Vauban was the original seat of the European Court of Justice, and is now an art museum.During the excavation for the construction of the underground Monterey car park, the remains of the fort was uncovered. Named the Lambert Redoubt, the pentagonal fortress can now be seen just south of avenue Monterey. The Lambert Fortress was originally built in 1685, renovated in 1835-6, and razed between 1868 and 1874.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==",

The song was chosen internally by broadcaster RTL and went on to bring Luxembourg their second consecutive Eurovision victory and a fourth in total.\nFollowing the contest David recorded \"Tu te reconna\u00eetras\" in various languages and enjoyed a sizeable hit in many parts of Europe.  The English-language version of the song (\"Wonderful Dream\") went to number 13 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\n== At Eurovision ==\nOn the night of the final David performed 11th in the running order, following Italy and preceding Sweden.  Pre-contest betting had rated the entries from Spain and the United Kingdom as favourites, with Luxembourg some way behind.  The same voting system used in the previous two contests was used again, but whereas the 1971 and 1972 contests had both produced very clear winners, in 1973 the voting was very tight throughout.  After the votes from the fourth of six groups of voters, the United Kingdom was ahead of Luxembourg and Spain by 3 points, but Luxembourg scored strongest from the last two groups and gained a narrow victory, 4 points in front of Spain and 6 ahead of the United Kingdom.  The closeness of the result, together with complaints which had been made from the start about the system's potential for manipulation \u2013 it was the only system ever used in which countries did not all have the same preset number of points to award \u2013  led to the abandonment of the system before the 1974 contest.\n\n\n=== Points awarded to Luxembourg ===\n\n\n=== Points awarded by Luxembourg ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nLuxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest\nEurovision Song Contest 1973\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Great place to go with your kids. Animals are healthy and cages are clean and adequate. Ample playgrounds for kids including water playground. It's possible to feed the animals but must buy the correct food at the place. Food restaurants \u2026",
          "For children. There are lots of playing ground and huge ones. But for seeing animals, please do not waste your weekend, because there is no ordinary animals or options there",

          "Incredible value for money, including for small children. The park is easy to access, ample parking on the road but also in a newly refurbished parking. Food: great food in the a la carte restaurant, but a bit expensive; quite acceptable \u2026",

          "We had a really good time at the park with our 6,8,12,14 year old children. The price was fair for what was there.  We spent about 5 hours at the park.  Lots of animals. Small water play area and aevral other plau area's.  Picnic tables loos all well layed out. Drinks and food a bit expensive.  Dogs are welcome too.",

          "Just an average zoo. Animals were pale when we visited just 2 weeks after the zoo opened after winter. Can be maintained better. 10 EUR per entry. However, we were happy to see penguins and kangaroos for the first time. Peacocks were left \u2026",

        "wiki": "Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: L\u00ebtzebuerg, French: Luxembourg, German: Luxemburg), also known as Luxembourg City (Luxembourgish: Stad L\u00ebtzebuerg or d'Stad, French: Ville de Luxembourg, German: Stadt Luxemburg, Luxemburg-Stadt), is the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the country's most populous commune. Standing at the confluence of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers in southern Luxembourg, the city lies at the heart of Western Europe, situated 213 km (132 mi) by road from Brussels, 372 km (231 mi) from Paris, and 209 km (130 mi) from Cologne. The city contains Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.\nAs of 31 December 2019, Luxembourg City has a population of 122,273 inhabitants, which is more than three times the population of the country's second most populous commune (Esch-sur-Alzette). The city's population consists of 160 nationalities. Foreigners represent 70% of the city's population, while Luxembourgers represent 30% of the population, and the number of foreign-born residents in the city rises steadily each year.In 2011, Luxembourg was ranked as having the second-highest per capita GDP in the world at $80,119 (PPP), with the city having developed into a banking and administrative centre. In the 2011 Mercer worldwide survey of 221 cities, Luxembourg was placed first for personal safety, while it was ranked 19th for quality of living.Luxembourg is one of the de facto capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg), as it is the seat of several institutions, agencies, and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, and Eurostat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Roman era, a fortified tower guarded the crossing of two Roman roads that met at the site of Luxembourg city. Through an exchange treaty with the abbey of Saint Maximin in Trier in 963, Siegfried I of the Ardennes, a close relative of King Louis II of France and Emperor Otto the Great, acquired the feudal lands of Luxembourg. Siegfried built his castle, named Lucilinburhuc (\"small castle\"), on the Bock Fiels (\"rock\"), mentioned for the first time in the aforementioned exchange treaty.\nIn 987, Archbishop Egbert of Trier consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael's Church). At a Roman road intersection near the church, a marketplace appeared around which the city developed.\nThe city, because of its location and natural geography, has through history been a place of strategic military significance. The first fortifications were built as early as the 10th century. By the end of the 12th century, as the city expanded westward around the new St. Nicholas Church (today the Cathedral of Notre Dame), new walls were built that included an area of 5 hectares (12 acres). In about 1340, under the reign of John the Blind, new fortifications were built that stood until 1867.\nIn 1443, the Burgundians under Philip the Good conquered Luxembourg. Luxembourg became part of the Burgundian, and later Spanish and Austrian empires (See Spanish Netherlands and Spanish Road) and under those Habsburg administrations Luxembourg Castle was repeatedly strengthened so that by the 16th century, Luxembourg itself was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. Subsequently, the Burgundians, the Spanish, the French, the Spanish again, the Austrians, the French again, and the Prussians conquered Luxembourg.\nIn the 17th century, the first casemates were built; initially, Spain built 23 km (14 mi) of tunnels, starting in 1644. These were then enlarged under French rule by Marshal Vauban, and augmented again under Austrian rule in the 1730s and 1740s.\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, the city was occupied by France twice: once, briefly, in 1792\u20133, and, later, after a seven-month siege. Luxembourg held out for so long under the French siege that French politician and military engineer Lazare Carnot called Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city's nickname: the 'Gibraltar of the North'.Nonetheless, the Austrian garrison eventually surrendered, and as a consequence, Luxembourg was annexed by the French Republic, becoming part of the d\u00e9partement of For\u00eats, with Luxembourg City as its pr\u00e9fecture. Under the 1815 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars, Luxembourg City was placed under Prussian military control as a part of the German Confederation, although sovereignty passed to the House of Orange-Nassau, in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis, the 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg to dismantle the fortifications in Luxembourg City. Their demolition took sixteen years, cost 1.5 million gold francs, and required the destruction of over 24 km (15 mi) of underground defences and 4 hectares (9.9 acres) of casemates, batteries, barracks, etc. Furthermore, the Prussian garrison was to be withdrawn.\n\nWhen, in 1890, Grand Duke William III died without any male heirs, the Grand Duchy passed out of Dutch hands, and into an independent line under Grand Duke Adolphe. Thus, Luxembourg, which had hitherto been independent in theory only, became a truly independent country, and Luxembourg City regained some of the importance that it had lost in 1867 by becoming the capital of a fully independent state.\nDespite Luxembourg's best efforts to remain neutral in the First World War, it was occupied by Germany on 2 August 1914. On 30 August, Helmuth von Moltke moved his headquarters to Luxembourg City, closer to his armies in France in preparation for a swift victory. However, the victory never came, and Luxembourg would play host to the German high command for another four years. At the end of the occupation, Luxembourg City was the scene of an attempted communist revolution; on 9 November 1918, communists declared a socialist republic, but it lasted only a few hours.In 1921, the city limits were greatly expanded. The communes of Eich, Hamm, Hollerich, and Rollingergrund were incorporated into Luxembourg City, making the city the largest commune in the country (a position that it would hold until 1978).\nIn 1940, Germany occupied Luxembourg again. The Nazis were not prepared to allow Luxembourgers self-government, and gradually integrated Luxembourg into the Third Reich by informally attaching the country administratively to a neighbouring German province. Under the occupation, the capital city's streets all received new, German names, which was announced on 4 October 1940. The Avenue de la Libert\u00e9 for example, a major road leading to the railway station, was renamed \"Adolf-Hitlerstra\u00dfe\". Luxembourg City was liberated on 10 September 1944. The city was under long-range bombardment by the German V-3 cannon in December 1944 and January 1945.\nAfter the war, Luxembourg ended its neutrality, and became a founding member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the European Parliament until 1981. Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Investment Bank. Several departments of the European Commission are also based in Luxembourg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe highest point of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is Kneiff at 560 m, closely followed by Burgplatz at 559 m and Napoleonsgaart at 554 m.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLuxembourg City lies on the southern part of the Luxembourg plateau, a large Early Jurassic sandstone formation that forms the heart of the Gutland, a low-lying and flat area that covers the southern two-thirds of the country.\nThe city centre occupies a picturesque site on a salient, perched high on precipitous cliffs that drop into the narrow valleys of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers, whose confluence is in Luxembourg City. The 70 m (230 ft) deep gorges cut by the rivers are spanned by many bridges and viaducts, including the Adolphe Bridge, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and the Passerelle. Although Luxembourg City is not particularly large, its layout is complex, as the city is set on several levels, straddling hills and dropping into the two gorges.\nThe commune of Luxembourg City covers an area of over 51 km2 (20 sq mi), or 2% of the Grand Duchy's total area. This makes the city the fourth-largest commune in Luxembourg, and by far the largest urban area. Luxembourg City is not particularly densely populated, at about 1,700 people per km2; large areas of Luxembourg City are maintained as parks, forested areas, or sites of important heritage (particularly the UNESCO sites), while there are also large tracts of farmland within the city limits.\n\n\n=== Quarters of Luxembourg City ===\n\nLuxembourg City is subdivided into twenty-four quarters (French: quartiers), which cover the commune in its entirety. The quarters generally correspond to the major neighbourhoods and suburbs of Luxembourg City, although a few of the historic districts, such as Bonnevoie, are divided between two quarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nConsidering its latitude, Luxembourg City has an oceanic climate, with moderate precipitation, cold to cool winters and warm summers. Moderate to heavy cloud cover is present for more than two-thirds of the year.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nUnder the Luxembourgian constitution, local government is centred on the city's communal council. Consisting of twenty-seven members (fixed since 1964), each elected every six years on the second Sunday of October and taking office on 1 January of the next year, the council is the largest of all communal councils in Luxembourg. The city is nowadays considered a stronghold of the Democratic Party (DP), which is the second-largest party nationally. Currently, the Democratic Party is the largest party on the council, with eleven councillors.The city's administration is headed by the mayor, who is the leader of the largest party on the communal council. After Xavier Bettel became Luxembourg's new prime minister on 4 December 2013, Lydie Polfer (DP) was sworn in as new mayor of Luxembourg on 17 December of the same year. The mayor leads the cabinet, the coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal, in which the DP forms a coalition with The Greens. Unlike other cities in Luxembourg, which are limited to four \u00e9chevins at most, Luxembourg is given special dispensation to have six \u00e9chevins on its coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal.\n\n\n=== National government ===\n\nLuxembourg City is the seat for the Luxembourg Government. The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg lives at Berg Castle in Colmar-Berg.\nFor national elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the city is located in the Centre constituency.\n\n\n=== European institutions ===\nLuxembourg City is the seat of several institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank. The majority of these institutions are located in the Kirchberg quarter, in the northeast of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDespite the city's comparatively small size, it has several notable museums: the recently renovated National Museum of History and Art (MNHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam) and National Museum of Natural History (NMHN). The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications. In addition to its two main theatres, the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Capucins, there is a new concert hall, the Philharmonie, as well as a conservatory with a large auditorium. Art galleries include the Villa Vauban, the Casino Luxembourg and Am Tunnel.Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, along with the Romanian city of Sibiu, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.\nLuxembourg City is also famed for its wide selection of restaurants and cuisines, including four Michelin starred establishments.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe ING Europe Marathon has been contested annually in the capital since June 2006. It attracted 11,000 runners and over 100,000 spectators during the 2014 edition\nThe Luxembourg Open is a tennis tournament held since 1991 in the capital. The tournament runs from 13 to 21 October. BGL BNP Paribas, one of the more famous sponsors in the world of tennis, was the contracted title sponsor of the tournament until 2014.\nThe D'Coque National Sporting and Cultural Centre, in the quarter of Kirchberg, is the largest sporting venue in the country, with a capacity of 8,300 for indoor sports and swimming.\nThe two football clubs of the city of Luxembourg; Racing FC Union Luxembourg and FC RM Hamm Benfica, play in the country's highest league, the Luxembourg National Division. The 8,000-seater Stade Josy Barthel hosts the Luxembourg national football team, and CAL Spora Luxembourg, which with 400 members is the nation's largest athletics club.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nPlaces of interest include the Gothic Revival Cathedral of Notre Dame, the fortifications, the AM Tunnel (an art gallery underground), the Grand Ducal Palace, the G\u00eblle Fra war memorial, the casemates, the Neum\u00fcnster Abbey, the Place d'Armes, the Adolphe Bridge and the city hall. The city is the home of the University of Luxembourg and RTL Group.\nThe Second World War Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial is located within the city limits of Luxembourg at Hamm. This cemetery is the final resting place of 5,076 American military dead, including General George S. Patton. There is also a memorial to 371 Americans whose remains were never recovered or identified.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nLuxembourg is situated in the heart of Europe in the Gold Triangle between Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam. It is therefore connected to several motorways and international routes.\n\nA1 (E44): to Grevenmacher and Trier (Germany).\nA3 (E25): to Dudelange and Thionville (France).\nA4: to Esch-sur-Alzette and to A13 to P\u00e9tange, Athus (Belgium) and Longwy (France)\nA6 (E25 / E411): to Arlon and Brussels.\nA7 (E421): to Mersch and Ettelbruck.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nLuxembourg City is served by five rail stations operated by the state rail company, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), including the principal station and terminus of all rail lines in the Grand Duchy, Luxembourg station. Stations in Luxembourg City are served by domestic rail services operated by CFL, as well as international rail services, operated by CFL,  and German, Belgian, and French service providers. Additionally, Luxembourg station is connected to the French LGV Est network, providing high-speed services on to Paris and Strasbourg. Services to Basel and Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland are available via two daily scheduled international trains.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nLuxembourg City has a network of 31 bus routes, operated by the municipal transport authority, Autobus de la Ville de Luxembourg (AVL), partly subcontracted to private bus companies. There is also a free bus service linking the Glacis to Luxembourg station, the \"Joker Line\" for seniors, and a \"City night network\". A \"Park & Ride\"  scheme is operated by the city with five carparks connected to the bus network. In addition to AVL buses, CFL and RGTR operate regional buses to other locales in Luxembourg and nearby cities in Germany and France.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\nOn 10 December 2017, the first stage of Luxembourg City's new tram line opened between Luxexpo and the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge serving the Kirchberg quarter. An extension to the city centre (St\u00e4replaz-\u00c9toile) was opened on 27 July 2018. Further extensions to Luxembourg station, Bonnevoie, Howald, and Cloche d\u2019Or are due to be completed by 2020/21.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLuxembourg City is served by the only international airport in the country: Luxembourg Airport (codes: IATA: LUX, ICAO: ELLX). Accessibility to the airport, situated in the commune of Sandweiler, 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from the city centre, is provided via the municipal bus network, with a tram connection due to be completed by 2021. The airport is the principal hub for Luxembourg's flag carrier, Luxair, and one of the world's largest cargo airlines, Cargolux.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLuxembourg is a member of the QuattroPole union of cities, along with Trier, Saarbr\u00fccken, and Metz (neighbouring countries: Germany and France).\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nLuxembourg is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Luxembourg City\nCessange\nEurovision Song Contest 1962, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1966, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1973, held at the  Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\nEurovision Song Contest 1984, held in the Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of Luxembourg City\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMakos, Adam (2019).

        "wiki": "The Bock (Luxembourgish: Bockfiels) is a promontory in the north-eastern corner of Luxembourg City's old historical district. Offering a natural fortification, its rocky cliffs tower above the River Alzette which surrounds it on three sides. It was here that Count Siegfried built his Castle of Lucilinburhuc in 963, providing a basis for the development of the town which became Luxembourg. Over the centuries, the Bock and the surrounding defences were reinforced, attacked and rebuilt time and time again as the armies of the Burgundians, Habsburgs, Spaniards, Prussians and French vied for victory over one of Europe's most strategic strongholds, the Fortress of Luxembourg. Warring did not stop until the Treaty of London was signed in 1867, calling for the demolition of the fortifications. Ruins of the old castle and the vast underground system of passages and galleries known as the casemates continue to be a major tourist attraction.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n    \nIt was in 963 that Count Siegfried, in search of a site from which he could defend his properties, obtained the Bock and its surroundings from St Maximin's Abbey in Trier in exchange for the land he owned at Feulen in the Ardennes to the north. The Romans, then the Franks, had probably already inhabited the Bock although there is only scant archeological evidence of their presence. There are however traces of a 4th-century Roman watchtower close to the point in the Fish Market where two major Roman roads used to cross, one from Reims to Trier and the other from Metz to Li\u00e8ge.\n\nThe first historical mention of the Bock is indeed in connection with a watchtower or fortification on the Roman road from Reims to Trier  which, in 723, was ceded by Charles Martel, Duke of the Franks, to the Abbey of St Maximin in Trier. Two centuries later, Count Siegfried, who had properties \"in Feulen, Hosingen and Monnerich in the Pagus Wabrensis, in Sarreburg, Berncastel and Roussy in the Pagus Mosellanus\", was looking for a location for a castle able to withstand any onslaught which would serve as a central point for his holdings. After failing to obtain a site near the Abbey of Stavelot, now in the Belgian province of Li\u00e8ge, he approached the Abbot of St Maximin's for the purchase of the property high up on the Bock cliff above the Alzette River, described as a \"castle by name Lucilinburhuc\" (castellum quod dicitur Lucilinburhuc). It therefore seems as if there was already a castle on the site before Siegfried became interested in it and that it was not Siegfried who called it Lucilinburhuc. After the consent of Emperor Otto I had been obtained, the deed was signed by Viker, Abbot of St Maximin's, on 7 April 963. Siegfried acquired the site in exchange for some of his properties at Feulen.\n\nOver the centuries, Siegfried's fortified castle on the Bock was considerably enlarged and protected with additional walls and defences. In 987, the castle chapel was built at the nearby Fish Market. Today's St Michael's Church stands on the same site.  Under Conrad I, the castle became the residence of the Counts of Luxembourg. It was damaged, destroyed, captured and rebuilt on several occasions as the Burgundians (1473), the Habsburgs (1477), and the Spaniards (1555) attacked and took the fortress.As time passed, the fortifications needed to be adapted to new methods of war based on increasingly strong firepower. During the 1640s under the Spaniards, the Swiss engineer Isaac von Treybach significantly reworked the defences. The Bock was also strengthened with three forts, the Large Bock, Middle Bock and Small Bock (from west to east), separated from each other by cuts in the rock and linked by bridges. As a result, little remained of the medieval castle.A little later in 1684, on behalf of Louis XIV, Vauban succeeded in capturing the city of Luxembourg during a month-long siege under which the Bock fortifications were completely flattened. Thereafter Vauban, perhaps the most competent fortification engineer of his day, undertook major additions to the defences, realizing that underground passages and chambers were just as important as the surface installations. The Large Bock, connected to the old town by the Pont du Ch\u00e2teau, was further reinforced. Enclosed by a wall 12 m (39 ft) high, it was the major component of the new fortress.\n\nIn addition to these structures, the Bock also included a system of casemates which originated in the cellars of the medieval castle. In 1744, during the Austrian period, these underground passages were considerably enlarged by General Neipperg. The main passage. which still remains, is 110 m long and up to 7 m wide. Branches leading off on either side were equipped with no less than 25 cannon slots, 12 to the north and 13 to the south, offering considerable firepower. In the event of war, the Bock casemates, covering an area of 1,100 m2, could be used as barracks for several hundred soldiers. Water was supplied from a well 47 m deep.Thanks to its defences, in 1794 during the French Revolutionary Wars, the city held out against a French siege for seven months. When the garrison finally surrendered, the walls were still unbreached. This led the French politician and engineer Lazare Carnot to call the Luxembourg fortress \"the best in the world, apart from Gibraltar\". As a result, it has often been called the Gibraltar of the North.\nThe fortifications were finally demolished under the terms of the Treaty of London in 1867. The demolition took 16 years and cost the enormous sum of 1.5 million gold francs.\n\n\n== Pont du ch\u00e2teau ==\n\nThe two-storey bridge connecting the Bock to the old town was an important component of the fortifications. Technically, it is a rather curious structure. Built in 1735 by the Austrians, it provides no less than four ways of crossing between the cliffs: the road over the top, a passage by way of the four upper arches, a spiral staircase up through the main arch and a tunnel under the road at the bottom.\n\n\n== Famous visitors ==\nOver the years, the Bock casemates have received several famous visitors. These include:\n\nEmperor Joseph II of Austria (1781);\nNapoleon Bonaparte (1804);\nPrince Henry of the Netherlands (1868);\nGrand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg (1936);\nGrand Duke Henri of Luxembourg and his wife Grand Duchess Maria Teresa (2000).\n\n\n== The legend of Melusina ==\nThere have reportedly been people that have seen Melusine in the waters nearby.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLuxembourg City\nHistory of Luxembourg\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: L\u00ebtzebuerg, French: Luxembourg, German: Luxemburg), also known as Luxembourg City (Luxembourgish: Stad L\u00ebtzebuerg or d'Stad, French: Ville de Luxembourg, German: Stadt Luxemburg, Luxemburg-Stadt), is the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the country's most populous commune. Standing at the confluence of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers in southern Luxembourg, the city lies at the heart of Western Europe, situated 213 km (132 mi) by road from Brussels, 372 km (231 mi) from Paris, and 209 km (130 mi) from Cologne. The city contains Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.\nAs of 31 December 2019, Luxembourg City has a population of 122,273 inhabitants, which is more than three times the population of the country's second most populous commune (Esch-sur-Alzette). The city's population consists of 160 nationalities. Foreigners represent 70% of the city's population, while Luxembourgers represent 30% of the population, and the number of foreign-born residents in the city rises steadily each year.In 2011, Luxembourg was ranked as having the second-highest per capita GDP in the world at $80,119 (PPP), with the city having developed into a banking and administrative centre. In the 2011 Mercer worldwide survey of 221 cities, Luxembourg was placed first for personal safety, while it was ranked 19th for quality of living.Luxembourg is one of the de facto capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg), as it is the seat of several institutions, agencies, and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, and Eurostat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Roman era, a fortified tower guarded the crossing of two Roman roads that met at the site of Luxembourg city. Through an exchange treaty with the abbey of Saint Maximin in Trier in 963, Siegfried I of the Ardennes, a close relative of King Louis II of France and Emperor Otto the Great, acquired the feudal lands of Luxembourg. Siegfried built his castle, named Lucilinburhuc (\"small castle\"), on the Bock Fiels (\"rock\"), mentioned for the first time in the aforementioned exchange treaty.\nIn 987, Archbishop Egbert of Trier consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael's Church). At a Roman road intersection near the church, a marketplace appeared around which the city developed.\nThe city, because of its location and natural geography, has through history been a place of strategic military significance. The first fortifications were built as early as the 10th century. By the end of the 12th century, as the city expanded westward around the new St. Nicholas Church (today the Cathedral of Notre Dame), new walls were built that included an area of 5 hectares (12 acres). In about 1340, under the reign of John the Blind, new fortifications were built that stood until 1867.\nIn 1443, the Burgundians under Philip the Good conquered Luxembourg. Luxembourg became part of the Burgundian, and later Spanish and Austrian empires (See Spanish Netherlands and Spanish Road) and under those Habsburg administrations Luxembourg Castle was repeatedly strengthened so that by the 16th century, Luxembourg itself was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. Subsequently, the Burgundians, the Spanish, the French, the Spanish again, the Austrians, the French again, and the Prussians conquered Luxembourg.\nIn the 17th century, the first casemates were built; initially, Spain built 23 km (14 mi) of tunnels, starting in 1644. These were then enlarged under French rule by Marshal Vauban, and augmented again under Austrian rule in the 1730s and 1740s.\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, the city was occupied by France twice: once, briefly, in 1792\u20133, and, later, after a seven-month siege. Luxembourg held out for so long under the French siege that French politician and military engineer Lazare Carnot called Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city's nickname: the 'Gibraltar of the North'.Nonetheless, the Austrian garrison eventually surrendered, and as a consequence, Luxembourg was annexed by the French Republic, becoming part of the d\u00e9partement of For\u00eats, with Luxembourg City as its pr\u00e9fecture. Under the 1815 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars, Luxembourg City was placed under Prussian military control as a part of the German Confederation, although sovereignty passed to the House of Orange-Nassau, in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis, the 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg to dismantle the fortifications in Luxembourg City. Their demolition took sixteen years, cost 1.5 million gold francs, and required the destruction of over 24 km (15 mi) of underground defences and 4 hectares (9.9 acres) of casemates, batteries, barracks, etc. Furthermore, the Prussian garrison was to be withdrawn.\n\nWhen, in 1890, Grand Duke William III died without any male heirs, the Grand Duchy passed out of Dutch hands, and into an independent line under Grand Duke Adolphe. Thus, Luxembourg, which had hitherto been independent in theory only, became a truly independent country, and Luxembourg City regained some of the importance that it had lost in 1867 by becoming the capital of a fully independent state.\nDespite Luxembourg's best efforts to remain neutral in the First World War, it was occupied by Germany on 2 August 1914. On 30 August, Helmuth von Moltke moved his headquarters to Luxembourg City, closer to his armies in France in preparation for a swift victory. However, the victory never came, and Luxembourg would play host to the German high command for another four years. At the end of the occupation, Luxembourg City was the scene of an attempted communist revolution; on 9 November 1918, communists declared a socialist republic, but it lasted only a few hours.In 1921, the city limits were greatly expanded. The communes of Eich, Hamm, Hollerich, and Rollingergrund were incorporated into Luxembourg City, making the city the largest commune in the country (a position that it would hold until 1978).\nIn 1940, Germany occupied Luxembourg again. The Nazis were not prepared to allow Luxembourgers self-government, and gradually integrated Luxembourg into the Third Reich by informally attaching the country administratively to a neighbouring German province. Under the occupation, the capital city's streets all received new, German names, which was announced on 4 October 1940. The Avenue de la Libert\u00e9 for example, a major road leading to the railway station, was renamed \"Adolf-Hitlerstra\u00dfe\". Luxembourg City was liberated on 10 September 1944. The city was under long-range bombardment by the German V-3 cannon in December 1944 and January 1945.\nAfter the war, Luxembourg ended its neutrality, and became a founding member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the European Parliament until 1981. Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Investment Bank. Several departments of the European Commission are also based in Luxembourg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe highest point of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is Kneiff at 560 m, closely followed by Burgplatz at 559 m and Napoleonsgaart at 554 m.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLuxembourg City lies on the southern part of the Luxembourg plateau, a large Early Jurassic sandstone formation that forms the heart of the Gutland, a low-lying and flat area that covers the southern two-thirds of the country.\nThe city centre occupies a picturesque site on a salient, perched high on precipitous cliffs that drop into the narrow valleys of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers, whose confluence is in Luxembourg City. The 70 m (230 ft) deep gorges cut by the rivers are spanned by many bridges and viaducts, including the Adolphe Bridge, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and the Passerelle. Although Luxembourg City is not particularly large, its layout is complex, as the city is set on several levels, straddling hills and dropping into the two gorges.\nThe commune of Luxembourg City covers an area of over 51 km2 (20 sq mi), or 2% of the Grand Duchy's total area. This makes the city the fourth-largest commune in Luxembourg, and by far the largest urban area. Luxembourg City is not particularly densely populated, at about 1,700 people per km2; large areas of Luxembourg City are maintained as parks, forested areas, or sites of important heritage (particularly the UNESCO sites), while there are also large tracts of farmland within the city limits.\n\n\n=== Quarters of Luxembourg City ===\n\nLuxembourg City is subdivided into twenty-four quarters (French: quartiers), which cover the commune in its entirety. The quarters generally correspond to the major neighbourhoods and suburbs of Luxembourg City, although a few of the historic districts, such as Bonnevoie, are divided between two quarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nConsidering its latitude, Luxembourg City has an oceanic climate, with moderate precipitation, cold to cool winters and warm summers. Moderate to heavy cloud cover is present for more than two-thirds of the year.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nUnder the Luxembourgian constitution, local government is centred on the city's communal council. Consisting of twenty-seven members (fixed since 1964), each elected every six years on the second Sunday of October and taking office on 1 January of the next year, the council is the largest of all communal councils in Luxembourg. The city is nowadays considered a stronghold of the Democratic Party (DP), which is the second-largest party nationally. Currently, the Democratic Party is the largest party on the council, with eleven councillors.The city's administration is headed by the mayor, who is the leader of the largest party on the communal council. After Xavier Bettel became Luxembourg's new prime minister on 4 December 2013, Lydie Polfer (DP) was sworn in as new mayor of Luxembourg on 17 December of the same year. The mayor leads the cabinet, the coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal, in which the DP forms a coalition with The Greens. Unlike other cities in Luxembourg, which are limited to four \u00e9chevins at most, Luxembourg is given special dispensation to have six \u00e9chevins on its coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal.\n\n\n=== National government ===\n\nLuxembourg City is the seat for the Luxembourg Government. The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg lives at Berg Castle in Colmar-Berg.\nFor national elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the city is located in the Centre constituency.\n\n\n=== European institutions ===\nLuxembourg City is the seat of several institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank. The majority of these institutions are located in the Kirchberg quarter, in the northeast of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDespite the city's comparatively small size, it has several notable museums: the recently renovated National Museum of History and Art (MNHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam) and National Museum of Natural History (NMHN). The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications. In addition to its two main theatres, the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Capucins, there is a new concert hall, the Philharmonie, as well as a conservatory with a large auditorium. Art galleries include the Villa Vauban, the Casino Luxembourg and Am Tunnel.Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, along with the Romanian city of Sibiu, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.\nLuxembourg City is also famed for its wide selection of restaurants and cuisines, including four Michelin starred establishments.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe ING Europe Marathon has been contested annually in the capital since June 2006. It attracted 11,000 runners and over 100,000 spectators during the 2014 edition\nThe Luxembourg Open is a tennis tournament held since 1991 in the capital. The tournament runs from 13 to 21 October. BGL BNP Paribas, one of the more famous sponsors in the world of tennis, was the contracted title sponsor of the tournament until 2014.\nThe D'Coque National Sporting and Cultural Centre, in the quarter of Kirchberg, is the largest sporting venue in the country, with a capacity of 8,300 for indoor sports and swimming.\nThe two football clubs of the city of Luxembourg; Racing FC Union Luxembourg and FC RM Hamm Benfica, play in the country's highest league, the Luxembourg National Division. The 8,000-seater Stade Josy Barthel hosts the Luxembourg national football team, and CAL Spora Luxembourg, which with 400 members is the nation's largest athletics club.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nPlaces of interest include the Gothic Revival Cathedral of Notre Dame, the fortifications, the AM Tunnel (an art gallery underground), the Grand Ducal Palace, the G\u00eblle Fra war memorial, the casemates, the Neum\u00fcnster Abbey, the Place d'Armes, the Adolphe Bridge and the city hall. The city is the home of the University of Luxembourg and RTL Group.\nThe Second World War Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial is located within the city limits of Luxembourg at Hamm. This cemetery is the final resting place of 5,076 American military dead, including General George S. Patton. There is also a memorial to 371 Americans whose remains were never recovered or identified.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nLuxembourg is situated in the heart of Europe in the Gold Triangle between Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam. It is therefore connected to several motorways and international routes.\n\nA1 (E44): to Grevenmacher and Trier (Germany).\nA3 (E25): to Dudelange and Thionville (France).\nA4: to Esch-sur-Alzette and to A13 to P\u00e9tange, Athus (Belgium) and Longwy (France)\nA6 (E25 / E411): to Arlon and Brussels.\nA7 (E421): to Mersch and Ettelbruck.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nLuxembourg City is served by five rail stations operated by the state rail company, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), including the principal station and terminus of all rail lines in the Grand Duchy, Luxembourg station. Stations in Luxembourg City are served by domestic rail services operated by CFL, as well as international rail services, operated by CFL,  and German, Belgian, and French service providers. Additionally, Luxembourg station is connected to the French LGV Est network, providing high-speed services on to Paris and Strasbourg. Services to Basel and Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland are available via two daily scheduled international trains.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nLuxembourg City has a network of 31 bus routes, operated by the municipal transport authority, Autobus de la Ville de Luxembourg (AVL), partly subcontracted to private bus companies. There is also a free bus service linking the Glacis to Luxembourg station, the \"Joker Line\" for seniors, and a \"City night network\". A \"Park & Ride\"  scheme is operated by the city with five carparks connected to the bus network. In addition to AVL buses, CFL and RGTR operate regional buses to other locales in Luxembourg and nearby cities in Germany and France.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\nOn 10 December 2017, the first stage of Luxembourg City's new tram line opened between Luxexpo and the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge serving the Kirchberg quarter. An extension to the city centre (St\u00e4replaz-\u00c9toile) was opened on 27 July 2018. Further extensions to Luxembourg station, Bonnevoie, Howald, and Cloche d\u2019Or are due to be completed by 2020/21.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLuxembourg City is served by the only international airport in the country: Luxembourg Airport (codes: IATA: LUX, ICAO: ELLX). Accessibility to the airport, situated in the commune of Sandweiler, 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from the city centre, is provided via the municipal bus network, with a tram connection due to be completed by 2021. The airport is the principal hub for Luxembourg's flag carrier, Luxair, and one of the world's largest cargo airlines, Cargolux.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLuxembourg is a member of the QuattroPole union of cities, along with Trier, Saarbr\u00fccken, and Metz (neighbouring countries: Germany and France).\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nLuxembourg is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Luxembourg City\nCessange\nEurovision Song Contest 1962, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1966, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1973, held at the  Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\nEurovision Song Contest 1984, held in the Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of Luxembourg City\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMakos, Adam (2019).

          "A free museum, worth popping in if your walking by. 30 minutes gives you an interesting look into the history of banking in this country. Building is gorgeous as is the view.",
          "I was expecting to have way more given the budget. The building looks great from the outside and with no doubt is an icon of city. Whether walking around or driving it is hard to don't take a second to enjoy the architecture.",
          "When I first saw the building, I was asking the taxi driver what was that palace? SO I found out is the Saving Bank, now the building hosts a museum. I got curious so the visit paid my curiosity.",
          "This is not a large museum, but it is quite interesting even for those of us not in the profession and with no special interest in numismatics. There is a good review of banking technology as well as Luxembourger currency. It will take less than an hour and is easy to find."

        "wiki": "The first generation of trams in Luxembourg ran from 1875 to 1964, before being withdrawn from service and the tramways removed.  A second generation of trams began operational service in December 2017, along a new route that will, by 2021, run from Luxembourg Airport to the Cloche d'Or business district.\n\n\n== Contemporary and future usage ==\n\nLuxembourg is in the process of reintroducing trams to its transport infrastructure. Construction work begun on a new tram depot on the edge of the Gr\u00fcnewald Forest and the Kirchberg quarter of Luxembourg City in January 2015, with the first tracks being laid in July 2016. The tramline, when fully operational, will have 24 stations connected by 16 km of tracks and have a capacity of 10,000 passengers per hour in each direction. Trams provided by the Spanish company CAF began trials on the first phase of the route in July 2017.\nOpened on 10 December 2017, the first phase of the route saw trams run from the depot, along Avenue John F. Kennedy, past the European district, the location of many EU institutions, before terminating at the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge. Here, a new funicular railway was opened on the same date allowing passengers to descend to Pfaffenthal-Kirchberg railway station for access to national and international heavy rail services running through the Pfaffenthal valley.In operation as of 27 July 2018, the second phase sees tram services extend across the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge to Place de l'\u00c9toile in the Limpertsberg quarter.The third phase, to be completed between 2019 and 2020, will see trams extend into the historical Ville Haute quarter, across the Adolphe Bridge and on to Luxembourg railway station for interchanges between national and international heavy rail services, before terminating in Bonnevoie. Work to widen and re-enforce the Adolphe Bridge, first opened in 1903, to accommodate the tramway was completed in July 2017, with a new cycle and pedestrian lane suspended beneath the existing bridge.The fourth and final stage of the route, due to be completed in 2021, will see tram services extend southwestwards from Bonnevoie to Howald, terminating at the new business district in Cloche d'Or. Concurrently, the tramline will also extend eastwards from the tram depot in the Kirchberg district to Senningerberg before terminating at Luxembourg Airport.In June 2018, the Minister for Sustainable Development and Infrastructure, Fran\u00e7ois Bausch, announced that exploratory work had been undertaken for a possible future extension of the tramline alongside the A4 motorway to Foetz by 2028, and onto Luxembourg's second most populous city, Esch-sur-Alzette, by 2035.  Trams would be expected to reach speeds of up to 100 km/h when traveling through rural sections of the route in a similar fashion to most light rail lines. Luxembourg City mayor Lydie Polfer confirmed in 2020 that there are plans to extend the tram line to Strassen.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\nTwenty-one CAF Urbos trams were delivered in 2017, with a further twelve ordered in 2018. They are 45 m (148 ft) long, 2.65 m (8 ft 8 in) wide, 3.6 m (12 ft) high, with 75 seats and able to carry up to 422 passengers at a top speed of 70 km/h (43 mph). To cope with a 3.6 km (2.2 mi) gap in the 750v DC catenary between \"Rout Br\u00e9ck\" tram stop in Kirchberg (about 160 m (520 ft) east of Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge) and the central railway station, the trams use CAF\u2019s Greentech Freedrive.\n\n\n== Historical usage and museum ==\n\nLuxembourg's first horse-drawn tram line began operations in 1875 running through Luxembourg City along a 10 km line.  Electrification followed in 1908. The original track followed a route from Luxembourg railway station through the city centre to Limpertsberg. It was extended to various parts of the city until 1930 when the network covered 31 km. Several lines were closed at the beginning of the 1960s as buses replaced the trams. The last tram ran on the line to Beggen on 5 September 1964. The country's other tram network designated Tramways Intercommunaux du Canton d'Esch served Esch-sur-Alzette and its surroundings from 1927 to 1956.A number of historic trams can be seen at Luxembourg City's tram and bus museum located on Rue de Bouillon in Hollerich. In particular, the museum exhibits two electric trams, two tram coaches, and a replica of a horse tram. There are also numerous models and photographs.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAssociation des mod\u00e9listes ferroviaires de Luxembourg (Walferdange): Les tramways de la ville de Luxembourg: T.V.L., Walferdange : A.M.F.L., 1986, 156p., Collection: Les chemins de fer luxembourgeois, Vol. 5.\nBohnert, Paul; Dhur, Raymond; Eck, Jules; Rauen, Prosper: De Minettstram: die Geschichte der interkommunalen Trambahnen im Kanton Esch, D\u00fcdelingen : Stadtverwaltung und Kulturkommission, 1985, 325p.\nHoffmann Jean-Paul, Dhur Raymond, Clesse Ren\u00e9, Balthasar Marcel: Tramway Municipaux - De Stater Tram: die Geschichte des \u00f6ffentlichen Personen-Nahverkehrs in der Stadt Luxemburg 1875-1993, Administration municipale, 1993, 259p.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nTransport in Luxembourg\nHistory of rail transport in Luxembourg\nTrams\nTrams in Europe\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nluxtram.lu",

        "wiki": "The City of Brussels (French: ville de Bruxelles [vil d\u0259 b\u0281ys\u025bl] or alternatively Bruxelles-Ville [b\u0281ys\u025bl vil]; Dutch: Stad Brussel [st\u0251d \u02c8br\u028fs\u0259l] or Brussel-Stad) is the largest municipality and historical centre of the Brussels-Capital Region, and the capital of Belgium. Besides the strict centre, it also covers the immediate northern outskirts where it borders municipalities in Flanders. It is the administrative centre of the European Union, thus often dubbed, along with the region, the EU's capital city.\nThe City of Brussels is a municipality consisting of the central historic town and certain additional areas within the greater Brussels-Capital Region, namely Haren, Laeken and Neder-Over-Heembeek to the north, as well as Avenue Louise/Louizalaan and the Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos park to the south.\nAs of 1 January 2017, the City of Brussels had a total population of 176,545. The total area is 32.61 km2 (12.59 sq mi) which gives a population density of 5,475 inhabitants per square kilometre (14,180/sq mi). As of 2007, there were approximately 50,000 registered non-Belgians in the City of Brussels. In common with all of Brussels' municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French\u2013Dutch).\n\n\n== Territorial history ==\n\nAt first, the City of Brussels was simply defined, being the area within the second walls of Brussels, the modern-day small ring. As the city grew, the surrounding villages grew as well, eventually growing into a contiguous city, though the local governments retained control of their respective areas.\nThe construction of Avenue Louise/Louizalaan was commissioned in 1847 as a monumental avenue bordered by chestnut trees that would allow easy access to the popular recreational area of the Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos. However, fierce resistance to the project was put up by the town of Ixelles (which was then still separate from Brussels) through whose land the avenue was supposed to run. After years of fruitless negotiations, Brussels finally annexed the narrow band of land needed for the avenue plus the Bois de la Cambre itself in 1864. That decision accounts for the unusual southeastern protrusion of the City of Brussels and for Ixelles being split in two separate parts. Part of the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles' Solbosch campus is also part of the City of Brussels, partially accounting for the bulge in the southeast end.\nUnlike most of the municipalities in Belgium, the ones located in the Brussels-Capital Region were not merged with others during mergers occurring in 1964, 1970, and 1975. However, a few neighbouring municipalities have been merged into the City of Brussels, including Haren, Laeken and Neder-Over-Heembeek in 1921. These comprise the northern bulge in the municipality. To the south-east is also a strip of land along Avenue Louise that was annexed from Ixelles.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n\n=== Pentagon ===\n\n\n==== Central District ====\nIt is in the heart of Saint-G\u00e9ry/Sint-Goriks Island, formed by the Senne river, and on which a first keep was built around 979, that the origin of Brussels is located. Today, the neighbourhood around the Halles Saint-G\u00e9ry/Sint-Gorikshallen, a former covered market, is one of the trendiest districts of the capital. In this Central District (French: Quartier du Centre, Dutch: Centrumwijk), there are some vestiges of the 13th-century first walls of Brussels, which surrounded the area between the first port on the Senne, the old Romanesque church (later replaced by the Brabantine Gothic Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula), and the former ducal palace of Coudenberg in today's Royal District. In the centre of this triangle are the Grand Place (Brussels' main square); the \u00celot Sacr\u00e9 district, which takes its name from its resistance to demolition projects, itself crossed by the Royal Saint-Hubert Galleries; the Saint-Jacques/Sint-Jacobs district, which welcomed the pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostela; as well as the Brussels Stock Exchange building, built on the site of a former convent, whose remains have been uncovered.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Royal District ====\nThe Royal District (French: Quartier Royal, Dutch: Koninklijke Wijk or Koningswijk) is thus named because it houses, on the one hand, the Place Royale/Koningsplein (\"Royal Square\" or \"King's Square\"), built under Charles-Alexander of Lorraine on the Coudenberg hill, on the site of the former Palace of the Dukes of Brabant, of which certain levels of foundation still exist, and on the other hand, the Royal Palace of Brussels, which faces Brussels' Park, on the other side of which is the Belgian House of Parliament (Palace of the Nation). Below the Royal District is the Central Station and the Mont des Arts/Kunstberg where the Royal Library of Belgium, the Royal Belgian Film Archive (Cinematek), the Brussels Centre for Fine Arts, the Museum of Cinema, the Musical Instrument Museum (MIM), the BELvue Museum, and the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium are located.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Sablon/Zavel District ====\nFrom the Place Royale/Koningsplein, Rue de la R\u00e9gence/Regentschapsstraat crosses the Sablon/Zavel District (French: Quartier des Sablons, Dutch: Zavelwijk), made of the larger Grand Sablon/Grote Zavel (\"Large Sablon\") square in the northwest and the smaller Petit Sablon/Kleine Zavel (\"Small Sablon\") square and garden in the southeast, divided by the Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon. It is a swanky district, where an antiques market is held, and in which antique and art dealers, as well as other luxury shops, have their businesses. Not far from there was the Art Nouveau Maison du Peuple/Volkshuis by the famous architect Victor Horta, until its demolition in 1965. The Sablon is also home to the Egmont Palace and the Royal Conservatory of Brussels.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Marolles/Marollen District ====\nIn the shadow of the gigantic Palace of Justice lies the old Marolles/Marollen District (French: Quartier des Marolles, Dutch: Marollenwijk, not to be confused with the Marolle that purists delimit to only 7 streets). From the Place de la Chapelle/Kapellemarkt to the Place du Jeu de Balle/Vossenplein, where a daily flea market has been held since 1873, along Rue Haute/Hogestraat and Rue Blaes/Blaestraat, second-hand and popular shops have for some years given way to antique shops, marking a profound change to the neighbourhood. The Cit\u00e9 Hellemans, a remarkable example of early 20th-century collective housing complexes, was built on the site of the neighbourhood's many squalid cul-de-sacs. Rue Haute, one of the longest and oldest streets in the city, follows the course of an old Gallo-Roman road, and runs along Saint Peter's Hospital, built in 1935 on the site of a lepers' hospital, to end at the Halle Gate, the only survivor of the series of gates which allowed passage inside the second walls of Brussels.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Midi\u2013Lemonnier District or Stalingrad District ====\nIt is in the heart of the Midi\u2013Lemonnier District (French: Quartier Midi\u2013Lemonnier, Dutch: Lemmonier\u2013Zuidwijk), where Rouppe Square is today, that Brussels' first South Station\u2014called Bogards' Station for the eponymous convent whose site it was built on, and to which Rue des Bogards/Bogaardenstraat is nowadays the only reference\u2014was located from 1839, the terminus of the South Line. The former presence of a station at this location also explains the unusual width of the current Avenue of Stalingrad, which goes from the square to the small ring road, cleared of its railways since the inauguration of Brussels-South Station, built outside the Pentagon in 1869. Because of this, the neighbourhood is sometimes called Stalingrad District (French: Quartier Stalingrad, Dutch: Stalingradwijk). At the same time, following the covering of the Senne, the neighbourhood saw the construction of haussmannian grand central boulevards, including Maurice Lemonnier Boulevard, bordered by Fontainas Square and Anneessens Square (location of the former Old Market), as well as by the Midi Palace. Each Sunday morning, the Midi district hosts the second largest market in Europe.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Senne/Zenne District or Dansaert District ====\nThe damp and swampy grounds around the present-day Rue de la Senne/Zennestraat and Rue des Fabriques/Fabriekstraat were occupied by craftsmen since the Middle Ages. An arm of the river crossed the defences of the second walls at the level of the Ninove Gate and the Petite \u00c9cluse/Kleine Sluis (\"Small Lock\"), which served as a port, an end of which remaining there until the 1960s. Later, small industries and many artisan breweries (now disappeared) established themselves in the area, which is still evident by the names of Rue du Houblon/Hopstraat (\"Hops Street\") and Rue du Vieux March\u00e9 aux Grains/Oude Graanmarktstraat (\"Old Grain Market Street\"). The Shot Tower (Tour \u00e0 Plomb), which was used for the manufacture of lead shot for hunting, and Rue de la Poudri\u00e8re/Kruitmolenstraat (\"Gunpowder Street\"), also testify to the neighbourhood's former activities. Long neglected as a result of the relocation of businesses outside the city centre, the Senne/Zenne District (French: Quartier de la Senne, Dutch: Zennewijk) has for a few years been the object of a new interest and is undergoing gentrification due to the many disused industrial premises being converted into lofts. The area around Rue Antoine Dansaert/Antoine Dansaertstraat has become a trendy district and is attracting a younger, more well-off, and mostly Dutch-speaking population. This new situation, which has the consequence of rising rents, is not without problems for the less fortunate inhabitants of the neighbourhood.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Quays District or Maritime District ====\nThe Quays District (French: Quartier des Quais, Dutch: Kaalenwijk) is that of the old port of Brussels, which played for a long time the role of \"belly\" of the city. The boats coming from the Scheldt river penetrated through the Rivage Gate, at the site of present-day Yser Square, to join one of the canals, whose docks were each reserved for one type of goods. Filled in the 19th century, at the opening of Brussels' new port, the canals were replaced by wide boulevards, the two sides of which retain in their names the memory of their former function: Quai aux Briques/Baksteenkaai (\"Brick Wharf\"), Quai au Bois \u00e0 Br\u00fbler/Brandhoutkaai (\"Firewood Wharf\"), Quai aux Pierres de Taille/Arduinkaai (\"Quarry Stone Wharf\"), Quai au Foin/Hooikaai (\"Hay Wharf\"), etc., or references to the neighbourhood's commercial activities: Rue du Magasin/Pakhuisstraat (\"Warehouse Street\"), Rue des Commer\u00e7ants/Koopliedenstraat (\"Traders Street\"), Rue du March\u00e9 aux Porcs/Varkensmarktstraat (\"Pig Market Street\") and Quai du Commerce/Handelskaai (\"Trade Wharf\"). Along the quaysides, numerous bourgeois houses, once belonging to wealthy merchants, have preserved the entrances to the warehouses. On Ypres Boulevard, one can still cross food wholesalers, supplied nowadays by trucks, which have replaced the boats. The neighbourhood also includes the beguinage of Brussels, with the Church of St. John the Baptist and the remarkable Grand Hospice Pach\u00e9co.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Marais\u2013Jacqmain District ====\nFew are the buildings in the Marais\u2013Jacqmain District (French: Quartier Marais\u2013Jacqmain, Dutch: Jacqmain\u2013Broekwijk) which have escaped 20th-century demolition, from Pach\u00e9co Boulevard to Rue Neuve/Nieuwstraat. They have been replaced by the State Administrative City, press printers, banking facilities, and commercial galleries. The current trend is to restore the neighbourhood's social mix by redeveloping housing in former office buildings. Despite the longtime grim aspect of the district, the Meyboom tradition has been maintained for centuries, and the former Art Nouveau Waucquez stores by Victor Horta have been preserved and house, since 1993, the Belgian Comic Strip Center. Another preserved islet is the 18th-century neoclassical Martyrs' Square, which has gradually been renovated. The victims of the Belgian Revolution of 1830 are buried there in an open crypt with a memorial. Nearby is Rue Neuve, one of the main commercial streets in Belgium, with on its two sides more than 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) long entirely occupied by shops; Adolphe Max Boulevard, a traditional artery with 19th-century facades; and \u00c9mile Jacqmain Boulevard (where the National Theatre of Belgium was installed in 2004) close to De Brouck\u00e8re Square. The latter, a very busy central point of the city centre, is dominated at its southern end by two block-style building towers, but for the rest, it has totally (Hotel Metropole and its neighbour the Hotel Atlanta) or partially (UGC cinema) preserved its old facades.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Freedom District ====\nThe Freedom District (French: Quartier des Libert\u00e9s, Dutch: Vrijheidswijk) is situated between the Belgian Parliament and Rue Royale/Koningsstraat, not far from the crossroads with the small ring road, and has as its focal point the Congress Column, built in memory of the National Congress of 1830\u201331, the founder of democratic liberties in Belgium, and under which also lies the tomb of the Unknown Soldier with the Sacred Flame. Not far from there is the Hotel Astoria, a 1911 palace, which is currently being renovated and enlarged, and will be reopened in the coming years. In the 19th century, the district was known as Notre-Dame-aux-Neiges/Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-ter-Sneeuw and was inhabited in majority by working-class people. The authorities' desire to clean up the squalid parts of the city led to the expulsion of the population and the neighbourhood's complete destruction. A new bourgeois district was developed during the last quarter of the century. The choice was made to commemorate the memory of the Belgian Independence: the Place de la Libert\u00e9/Vrijheidsplein (\"Liberty Square\"), the Place des Barricades/Barricadenplein (\"Barricades' Square\"), Rue de la R\u00e9volution/Revolutiestraat (\"Revolution Street\"), Rue du Congr\u00e8s/Congresstraat (\"Congress Street\"), etc. The four streets overlooking Liberty Square bear the names of the four constitutional freedoms, symbolised by the four female figures surrounding the Congress Column: Freedom of the Press, Religion, Association and Education. This eclectic urban complex is one of the best preserved of the Pentagon today.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Eastern districts ===\n\n\n==== European District and Leopold Quarter ====\nThe European District (French: Quartier Europ\u00e9en, Dutch: Europese Wijk) is located to the east of the Pentagon, around Luxembourg Square and the Schuman roundabout, and includes the smaller Leopold Quarter (French: Quartier L\u00e9opold, Dutch: Leopoldswijk). The European Parliament was built near Luxembourg Square, on the site of the former Quartier L\u00e9opold Station, and of which only the central building overlooking the square remains, having been replaced by the underground Brussels-Luxembourg railway station. The European Commission, housed in the Berlaymont building, is located on the Schuman roundabout, not far from the Cinquantenaire Park. Across the street stands the Justus Lipsius building and the Europa building (part of the Residence Palace), serving as the seat of the European Council and the Council of the EU. In Leopold Park, the House of European History provides visitors with a social history of the continent of Europe. There is a visitor centre in the main European Parliament building, known as the Parliamentarium, and another smaller one in the Justus Lipsius building, for the council of Europe. It is accessible on certain days, by appointment. Many of the attractions in the European quarter are free to visit.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Northern districts ===\n\n\n==== Laeken ====\nLaeken is a former municipality in the north of the Brussels-Capital Region, annexed by the City of Brussels in 1921. Laeken is home to, among others, the Royal Domain of Laeken, the Castle of Laeken, the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken (1873), the Church of Our Lady of Laeken (whose crypt contains the tombs of the Belgian Royal Family) and the Laeken Cemetery, known for its wealth of monuments and sculptures. On the territory of Laeken, there is also the Heysel/Heizel Plateau, where were held the World's Fairs of 1935 and 1958 and which includes the King Baudouin Stadium, Bruparck (with the Atomium, Mini-Europe miniature park and Kinepolis cinema), the Centenary Palace, home to the Brussels Exhibition Centre (Brussels Expo), and the Port of Brussels, next to which the Monument to Work by Constantin Meunier was erected.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Mutsaard ====\nSometimes also known as the Pagoda district, the Japanese tower district or De Wand district, Mutsaard (also spelled Mutsaert), is an old hamlet and a historic district located between Laeken and Neder-over-Heembeek and centred around Mutsaard Square. The district was part of the former municipality of Laeken (postcode: 1020) but also a piece of Neder-over-Heembeek, annexed by Laeken in 1897. It is separated from the rest of Laeken by the Royal Domain and is the site of the Museums of the Far East. The district also extends a little on the neighbouring Flemish municipalities of Vilvoorde and Grimbergen.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Neder-Over-Heembeek ====\nNeder-Over-Heembeek is a former municipality incorporated in the city of Brussels in 1921, at the same time as Laeken and Haren. It has the distinction of having the oldest place name in the Brussels-Capital Region, as it was mentioned in an ordinance as early as the 7th century. This is where the Queen Astrid Military Hospital, which is the National Burns and Poisons centre, as well as recruitment services of the Belgian Armed Forces are located.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Haren ====\nLike Laeken and Neder-Over-Heembeek, the former municipality of Haren was annexed by the municipality (City) of Brussels in 1921, which allowed the extension of the Schaerbeek railway station north of its territory. But it is the presence, southwest of the town, of an airfield, created by the Germans during the First World War, and where the Belgian national airline Sabena was born, which precipitated the annexation of Haren. For almost fifty years, Haren has been home to the NATO headquarters. It is also the location of many other administrations and companies, such as the headquarters of Eurocontrol.\n\n\n== Mayors ==\n\nAs in every other Belgian municipality, the City of Brussels is headed by a mayor, who should not be confused with the Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region or the Governor of Brussels-Capital.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThere are many museums in and around Brussels' city centre. On the first Sunday of every month, free entry is granted to many of Brussels' museums.\nThe Underwear Museum opened in 2009, and was initially in the City of Brussels. In 2016 it moved to Lessines, Hainaut, Wallonia.Below is an non-exhaustive list of museums in the City of Brussels:\n\nRoyal Museums of Art and History :\nArt & History Museum\nHorta-Lambeaux Pavilion\nHalle Gate\nMuseums of the Far East\nMusical Instrument Museum\nRoyal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium :\nOldmasters Museum\nMagritte Museum\nFin-de-Si\u00e8cle Museum\nWiertz Museum\nMeunier Museum\nMus\u00e9e royal d'Art moderne \u00e0 Bruxelles\nRoyal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History\n\n\n== Honorary citizens ==\nAmong the recipients of the honorary citizenship of the City of Brussels are:\n\n\n== Heraldry ==\n\n\n== Vexillology ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nTransport in Brussels\nTimeline of Brussels\nBourgeois of Brussels\nSeven Noble Houses of Brussels\nGuilds of Brussels\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of The City of Brussels\nPage related to The City of Brussels in the Brussels-Capital Region official web site\nWebcam Grand-Place Brussels\nInteractive map of Brussels historical city centre",

        "wiki": "Liberation Route Europe is an international remembrance trail that connects the main regions along the advance of the Western Allied Forces toward the liberation of Europe and final stage of the Second World War. The route started in 2008 as a Dutch regional initiative in the Arnhem-Nijmegen area and then developed into a transnational route that was officially inaugurated in Arromanches on June 6, 2014, during the Normandy D-day commemorations. The route goes from Southern England, (commemorating the early years of the war), through France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands to Berlin, in Germany and then extends to the Czech Republic and Poland. The southern route starts in Italy. As a form of remembrance tourism LRE aims to unfold these Allied offensives of 1944 and 1945 in one narrative combining the different perspectives and points of view. By combining locations with personal stories of people who fought and suffered there, it gives visitors the opportunity to follow the Allied march and visit significant sites from war cemeteries to museums and monuments but also events and commemorations. In April 2019, Liberation Route Europe became a certified Cultural Route of the Council of Europe.\n\n\n== The Route ==\n\n\n=== Great Britain ===\nAfter the fall of France in 1940 and their own defeat on the continent, The Royal Air Force (RAF) defended their island. The action became known as the Battle of Britain. The route starts in London and goes through Kent (from where the Dunkirk evacuation, was controlled) and Hampshire (where Operation Overlord, the D-Day landing was planned and prepared).\nImportant remembrance sites\n\nImperial War Museum\nChurchill War Rooms\nDungeness\nDover Castle\nD-Day Museum Portsmouth\nSouthwick House\n\n\n=== France ===\n\n\n==== Normandy ====\nDuring Operation Overlord, the largest amphibious assault in history, Allied forces landed on five beaches along an 80-kilometre (50-mile) stretch of Normandy coast on D-Day. This operation marked the start of the liberation of Western Europe. The route here comprises the five landing beaches: Omaha Beach (from Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes to Vierville-sur-Mer), Utah Beach (Sainte-Marie-du-Mont), Gold Beach (between Port-en-Bessin and La Rivi\u00e8re), Juno Beach (from Courseulles to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer), Sword Beach (from Ouistreham to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer), along with Pointe du Hoc (Criqueville-en-Bessin) and Ranville (British Airlandings) or Longues-sur-Mer (German Battery).\nThe following Battle of Normandy resulted not only in the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers, but also many French civilians. Almost all of the larger cities in the region were badly damaged.\n\nImportant remembrance sites\n\nMuseums\nLiberation Museum Cherbourg\nJuno Beach Centre\nD-Day Museum Arromanches\nM\u00e9morial de Caen\nMemorial Pegasus\nMerville Battery Museum\n'The Grand Bunker' Atlantikwall Museum\nAirborne Museum - Sainte-M\u00e8re-Eglise\nCrisbecq Battery Museum\nMemorial of Montormel\nMemorial Museum of the Battle of Normandy - Bayeux\nUtah Beach D-Day Museum\nCemeteries\nBayeux British Military Cemetery\nB\u00e9ny-sur-Mer Canadian Cemetery\nLa Cambe German Military Cemetery\nNormandy American Cemetery\nMonument\nLa Fi\u00e8re Bridge and Iron Mike Monument\n\n\n==== Paris ====\nAn uprising of the population against the Germans on August 19 forced the Allies to send troops to liberate Paris, although it was not a priority. The French 2nd Armoured Division entered Paris on the evening of August 24. The capitulation was signed on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, German troops surrendered at the Montparnasse train station.  Two days later a triumphal parade led by General Charles de Gaulle, was held on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es.\nImportant remembrance sites\n\nHistorial Charles de Gaulle\nMemorial General Leclerc de Hauteclocque and the Liberation of Paris - Jean Moulin Museum\nArmy Museum - Invalides\nOrder of Liberation Museum\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\n\n\n==== Ardennes ====\nThe Battle of the Bulge was the last major German offensive campaign launched through the densely forested Ardennes region.

With this battle, which ended in an Allied victory, the war returned to Germany and opened the road to Berlin.\nSeven 'audiospots' have been installed in the region.\nImportant remembrance sites\n\nMuseums\nMuseum H\u00fcrtgenwald 1944 - Vossenack\nField Hospital Bunker Simonskall\nVogelsang International Place\nCemeteries\nHalbe Forest Cemetery\nH\u00fcrtgen War Cemetery\nVossenack German Cemetery\nReichswald Forest British War Cemetery - Kleve\nAudiospots: 7\n\n\n==== Berlin ====\nBerlin is the endpoint of the route. The Battle of Berlin was one of the last battles of the Second World War in Europe. Many soldiers died in widespread house-to-house fighting where Soviet soldiers faced desperate German resistance. On May 2, 1945, the Berlin garrison surrendered to the Soviet army. The unconditional surrender of Germany was signed on the 8th.\n\nImportant remembrance sites\n\nMuseums\nAllied Museum\nGerman-Russian Museum\nCecilienhof Palace\nTopography of Terror\nMonuments\nKaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church\nReichstag\nSeelow Heights Memorial\nSoviet War Memorial Tiergarten\nSoviet War Memorial Treptow Park\nFriedrichstra\u00dfe Railway Bunker\nMemorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe\nCemeteries\nSoviet-Russian War Cemetery Simmerath-Rurberg\n\n\n=== Poland ===\n\n\n==== Gda\u0144sk ====\nOn the 1st of September 1939, the battleship Schleswig-Holstein opened fire on the Westerplatte in Gda\u0144sk.

        "wiki": "The culture of Luxembourg refers to the cultural life and traditions of Luxembourg. Most citizens are trilingual, speaking French and German in addition to the Germanic national language of Luxembourgish. Although its contributions to the arts are not largely known outside its borders, Luxembourg has a rich cultural history, especially in music, painting and photography. Its evolving museums, concert halls, theatres and galleries testify to its citizens' growing appreciation of culture.\n\n\n== Arts ==\n\n\n=== Painting ===\n\nJean-Baptiste Fresez and Nicolas Liez who both painted the City of Luxembourg and its surroundings were the country's most important 19th-century artists. Jean Jacoby, who was awarded two Olympic gold medals for his artwork and, above all, Joseph Kutter with his Expressionist landscapes and portraits, were notable during the first half of the 20th century. Kutter's brightly coloured painting of \"Luxembourg\", commissioned for the 1937 World Exposition in Paris reveals his mature Expressionist style, of which there is more than natural emphasis on how the houses appear to be stacked up one behind the other, how the buildings take on almost cubic contours and how the fortifications tower powerfully above the valley.Other celebrated painters of the periods were the Impressionist Dominique Lang; Nico Klopp, who painted striking post-impressionist landscapes of the Moselle; and Sosth\u00e8ne Weis, whose innumerable watercolours of Luxembourg City and its surroundings are reminiscent of the style of J. M. W. Turner. \nMajor contributors to the art scene after World War II were Emile Kirscht, Michel Stoffel, Foni Tissen, and Gust Graas. Closely associated with the post-war artists was the sculptor Lucien Wercollier whose impressive abstract works in bronze and marble can be found not just in public places in Luxembourg but in the surrounding countries too.The sculptor Claus Cito (1882\u20131965) is remembered above all for the G\u00eblle Fra (Golden Woman) sculpture crowning the Monument of Remembrance obelisk (1923), raised in memory of the Luxembourg soldiers who died for their country in the First World War.One of the country's most successful contemporary artists is Su-Mei Tse who, in 2003, won the Golden Lion, a prize awarded to the best national participant at the Venice International Exhibition of Contemporary Art.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Photography ===\n\nConsidering the country's small size, the photography in Luxembourg has made an important contribution to local culture. Although he grew up and worked all his life in the United States, the influential photographer and painter Edward Steichen was of Luxembourg descent, and after the Second World War as manager of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, he arranged two important donations for Luxembourg. First in 1964, he provided a permanent home in Clervaux, Luxembourg for his famous exhibition \"The Family of Man\"; and then in 1967, the USA sent another treasure to Luxembourg, the exhibition \"The Bitter Years\". Similarly, Gabriel Lippmann who was also born in Luxembourg but moved to France when only three, was awarded the Nobel prize for his pioneering work in colour photography. Charles Bernhoeft (1859-1933) was a successful portrait and landscape photographer, publishing a number of luxurious albums, illustrated maps and several series of postcards.\nContemporary photographers include the photojournalists Patrick Galbats, Yvon Lambert and Thierry Frisch.\n\n\n=== Literature and poetry ===\n\nLittle is known of Luxembourg literature beyond the country's borders, partly because three languages are used, partly because many works assume a local readership. Furthermore, it was not until the 19th century that the literature of Luxembourg began to develop.In 1829, Antoine Meyer published the very first book in L\u00ebtzebuerger D\u00e4itsch, the local Germanic dialect later called Luxembourgish, a collection of poems titled \"E' Schrek op de' Lezeburger Parnassus\" (A Step up Luxembourg's Parnassus).\nEdmond de la Fontaine (1823\u20131891), better known by his pen-name Dicks, is considered the national poet of Luxembourg. Along with Michel Lentz and Michel Rodange, he is an outstanding figure in the history of Luxembourg literature, writing poetry in Luxembourgish. Another influential writer was Batty Weber (1860\u20131940) who worked both as a journalist and as an author of short stories, novels, plays and poems, contributing much to the development of Luxembourg culture. Anise Koltz (born in 1928), first writing mainly in German and Luxembourgish but later in French, is the country's most important contemporary author. Another successful contemporary novelist and poet is Jean Portante (born in 1950).Luxembourgish literature was long confined to poetry and the theatre, but in the 1980s, as a result of the movement to make Luxembourgish an official language, Guy Rewenig (born in 1947) and Roger Manderscheid (1933\u20132010) both wrote novels in Luxembourgish. Rewenig's Hannert dem Atlantik appeared in 1985 and Manderscheid's childhood trilogy Schacko klak, De papagei um k\u00e2schtebam and Feier a flam in 1988.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe city of Luxembourg is on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\nThe architecture of Luxembourg extends back to the Treveri, a Celtic tribe that prospered in the 1st century BC. A few ruins remain from the Roman occupation but the most significant contributions over the centuries have been the country's castles and churches. Notable examples are the Vianden Castle and the Echternach Basilica. Today there is a veritable architectural boom as Luxembourg's economic prosperity provides a basis for developments in the financial, EU and cultural sectors with a number of world-class buildings. These include the Philharmonie Concert Hall, the Museum of Modern Art and the new European Investment Bank building.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe wide general interest in music and musical activities in Luxembourg can be seen from the membership of the Union Grand-Duc Adolphe, the national music federation for choral societies, brass bands, music schools, theatrical societies, folklore associations and instrumental groups. Some 340 societies with over 17,000 individual members are currently represented by the organization.The two main venues for classical music in Luxembourg are the Philharmonie concert hall, home to the Philharmonie de Luxembourg orchestra, and the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg with frequent performances of opera and ballet. Luxembourg's internationally recognized soloists include violinist Sandrine Cantoreggi, cellist Fran\u00e7oise Groben, pianists Francesco Tristano Schlim\u00e9 and Jean Muller, and singer Mariette Kemmer. Among its contemporary composers are Camille Kerger, Claude Lenners, Georges Lentz (although he lives mainly in Australia), Alexander Mullenbach and Marcel Wengler. Opera is frequently performed in Luxembourg City at the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre and in Esch-sur-Alzette at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Esch as well as at the annual Wiltz festival.Brian Molko, singer/guitarist of rock band Placebo lived in Luxembourg for most of his life, where he learned to play various instruments such as guitar, piano and saxophone. Bassist Stefan Olsdal also lived there, the two of them met at school in Luxembourg but lost touch until they met again years later in London.  One of the most influential Luxembourg bands of the last decades is Cool Feet, which performs old Luxembourgish songs.\nLuxembourg was a founding member of the Eurovision Song Contest and participated every year between 1956 and 1993, with the exception of 1959, although only eight of its 38 entries were performed by Luxembourgish artists. It won the competition five times (1961, 1965, 1972, 1973 and 1983), and hosted the contest four times (1962, 1966, 1973, and 1984).\n\n\n=== Cinema ===\n\n\n== Cultural institutions ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe major museums are:\n\nNational Museum of History and Art (MNHA)\nNational Museum of Natural History (NMHN)\nLuxembourg City History Museum\nMuseum of Modern Art Grand-Duc Jean (MUDAM)\n\n\n=== Galleries ===\nCasino Luxembourg, forum for contemporary art in Luxembourg City\nVilla Vauban, art museum\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\n\n\n=== Food ===\nLuxembourg's cuisine has been influenced over the years by neighboring France, Germany, and Belgium.  More recently, it has had influence from its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants.\nLuxembourg has many delicacies including its pastries, cheese, and fresh fish (brown trout, pike, and crayfish). Other delicacies include the Ardennes ham smoked in saltpeter, game during hunting season (such as hare and wild boar), small plum tarts in September (Quetsch), smoked neck of pork with broad beans (Judd mat Gaardebounen), fried small river fish (such as bream, chub, gudgeon, roach, and rudd), liver dumplings (Quenelle) with sauerkraut and boiled potatoes, black pudding (Tr\u00e4ipen), sausages with mashed potatoes and horseradish, and green bean soup (Bouneschlupp). French cuisine is prominent on many menus, and to a lesser extent so are German and Belgian cuisines.\n\n\n=== Alcohol ===\n\nA number of white and sparkling wines are produced in Luxembourg, on the north bank of the Moselle, which has a winemaking history dating back to the Romans. Luxembourg is known for making several different kinds of wine including Riesling, Pinot gris, Pinot noir, Pinot blanc, Auxerrois, Rivaner, Elbling, Gew\u00fcrztraminer, and Cr\u00e9mant de Luxembourg. Authentic Luxembourg wine can be identified by the National Mark.\nLuxembourg has a fair number of breweries, given its tiny size. Imported beer, however, is increasingly gaining control of the beer market in Luxembourg. During the 1970s and 1980s, over 600,000 hectoliters (almost 16 million US gallons) of beer were brewed each year. The peak was reached in 1976 when over 800,000 hectoliters of beer were brewed, and since then the amount has been decreasing. In 2001, production dropped below 400,000 hectoliters for the first time since 1950. Some beers are currently made in Luxembourg, including Battin Edelpils, the outstanding Battin Extra, Brasserie Battin, Bi\u00e8re Blonde and others at the Restaurant Beierhaascht, Bofferding Lager, Brasserie Bofferding, H\u00e9ngeschter, Cornelyshaff, Diekirch Premium, InBev-owned Brasserie de Luxembourg Mousel-Diekirch SA, Simon Dinkel and others at the Brasserie Simon. The Brasserie de Redang also brewed beer for five years, but closed in 2005.\n\n\n=== Specialties ===\nThese are some specialties of Luxembourg:\n\nTh\u00fcringer - Inexpensive, small sausages that taste like a spicy version of the German bratwurst. They are often sold by street vendors and at roadside stands. New regulations prohibit the use of the word \"Th\u00fcringer\" as it is now regionally protected and reserved to sausages produced in the German free state of Thuringia. They are now commonly referred to as \"Grillwurscht\" (L\u00ebtzebuerger) or \"Grillinger\".\nBouneschlupp - A green bean soup.\nGromperekichelcher - A carefully spiced potato pancake with chopped onions and parsley, then deep-fried. They are available at roadside stands as well.\n\u00c9isleker Ham - Smoke-cured raw ham, said to look like the Italian Prosciutto crudo, sliced paper-thin and commonly served with fresh bread.\nKachk\u00e9is (cooked cheese) - A soft cheese spread.\nP\u00e2t\u00e9 - A spreadable paste, usually made of meat but vegetarian versions exist.\nQuetschentaart - A plum tart; along with peach, cherry, and pear tarts, it is a typical dessert and can be found in any pastry shop or restaurant.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Luxembourg. Football in Luxembourg is governed by the Luxembourg Football Federation (FLF), which is a member of FIFA and UEFA. The FLF organises the men's, women's, and futsal national teams.\nThe Luxembourg National Division is the premier domestic sports League in the country. Luxembourg was amongst the first countries in the world to be introduced to football, with the National Division being established in 1913, and the national team playing its first match in 1911.\nThe game of football is the most popular sport in the whole country of Luxembourg (especially in the south), having developed earliest in the industrial Red Lands and Luxembourg City. Only once has the National Division been won by a team not from south of the country. Historically, Jeunesse Esch has been Luxembourg's most successful domestic club, having won the National Division on 27 occasions out of 93. Since 2000, the league has been dominated by F91 Dudelange, which has won the league on six of the past eight occasions.\nThe national team, nicknamed D'Leiwen ('The Lions'), is one of the weakest in the world, not having ranked above 130th in the world since 2002. The team has only made one appearance at the European Championship in 1964, which the team achieved moderate success at the 1964 European Championship, when the side beat the Netherlands and almost progressed to the semi-finals. The most famous current Luxembourgian footballer is Jeff Strasser, who has made a successful career in the French and German Leagues. Luxembourg's most famous past players include Louis Pilot and Guy Hellers, both of whom also coached the national team after ending their playing careers.\n\n\n=== Cricket ===\n\n\n== Traditional events ==\nThe dancing procession of Echternach is a festival which takes place annually. Dancers process through the streets of Echternach. The procession was inscribed as the hopping procession of Echternach on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2010.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLuxembourg's official cultural portal\nLuxembourg American Cultural Society\nThe Breweries of Luxembourg: beers, history, styles\nFood and Drink in Luxembourg\nLuxembourg Recipes",

        "wiki": "The Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris, commonly known as Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica and often simply Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur (French: Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, pronounced [sak\u0281e k\u0153\u0281]), is a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica, dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Paris, France. A popular landmark and the second most visited monument in Paris, the basilica stands at the summit of the butte Montmartre, the highest point in the city. Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica is above all a religious (Catholic) building, shown by its perpetual adoration of the Holy Eucharist since 1885, and is also seen as a double monument, political and cultural, both a national penance for the defeat of France in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War and for the socialist Paris Commune of 1871 crowning its most rebellious neighborhood, and an embodiment of conservative moral order, publicly dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which was an increasingly popular devotion since the visions of Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque in Paray-le-Monial.The basilica was designed by Paul Abadie. Construction began in 1875 and was completed in 1914. The basilica was consecrated after the end of World War I in 1919.\n\n\n== Basilica ==\n\nThe inspiration for Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur's design originated on 4 September 1870, the day of the proclamation of the Third Republic, with a speech by Bishop Fournier attributing the defeat of French troops during the Franco-Prussian War to a divine punishment after \"a century of moral decline\" since the French Revolution, in the wake of the division in French society that arose in the decades following that revolution, between devout Catholics and legitimist royalists on one side, and democrats, secularists, socialists, and radicals on the other. This schism in the French social order became particularly pronounced after the 1870 withdrawal of the French military garrison protecting the Vatican in Rome to the front of the Franco-Prussian War by Napoleon III, the secular uprising of the Paris Commune of 1870-1871, and the subsequent 1871 defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War.\nThough today the basilica is asserted to be dedicated in honor of the 58,000 who lost their lives during the war, the decree of the Assembl\u00e9e nationale 24 July 1873, responding to a request by the archbishop of Paris and voting its construction, specifies that it is to \"expiate the crimes of the Commune.\" Montmartre had been the site of the Commune's first insurrection, and the Communards had executed Georges Darboy, Archbishop of Paris, who became a martyr for the resurgent Catholic Church. His successor Guibert, climbing the Butte Montmartre in October 1872, was reported to have had a vision as clouds dispersed over the panorama: \"It is here, it is here where the martyrs are, it is here that the Sacred Heart must reign so that it can beckon all to come.\"In the moment of inertia following the resignation of the government of Adolphe Thiers, 24 May 1873, Fran\u00e7ois Pie, bishop of Poitiers, expressed the national yearning for spiritual renewal\u2014 \"the hour of the Church has come\"\u2014 that would be expressed through the \"Government of Moral Order\" of the Third Republic, which linked Catholic institutions with secular ones, in \"a project of religious and national renewal, the main features of which were the restoration of monarchy and the defense of Rome within a cultural framework of official piety,\" of which Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur is the chief lasting, triumphalist monument.\nThe 24 July decree voting its construction as a \"matter of public utility\" followed close on Thiers' resignation. The project was expressed by the Church as a National Vow (V\u0153u national) and financial support came from parishes throughout France. The dedicatory inscription records the basilica as the accomplishment of a vow by Alexandre Legentil and Hubert Rohault de Fleury, ratified by Joseph-Hippolyte Guibert, Archbishop of Paris. The project took many years to complete.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nA law of public utility was passed to seize land at the summit of Montmartre for the construction of the basilica. Architect Paul Abadie designed the basilica after winning a competition over 77 other architects. With delays in assembling the property, the foundation stone was finally laid 16 June 1875. Passionate debates concerning the basilica were raised in the Conseil Municipal in 1880, where the basilica was called \"an incessant provocation to civil war\" and it was debated whether to rescind the law of 1873 granting property rights, an impracticable proposition. The matter reached the Chamber of Deputies in the summer of 1882, in which the basilica was defended by Archbishop Guibert while Georges Clemenceau argued that it sought to stigmatize the Revolution. The law was rescinded but the basilica was saved by a technicality, and the bill was not reintroduced in the next session. A further attempt to halt the construction was defeated in 1897, by which time the interior was substantially complete and had been open for services for six years.\n\nAbadie died not long after the foundation had been laid, in 1884, and five architects continued with the work:  Honor\u00e9 Daumet (1884\u20131886), Jean-Charles Laisn\u00e9 (1886\u20131891), Henri-Pierre-Marie Rauline (1891\u20131904), Lucien Magne (1904\u20131916), and Jean-Louis Hulot (1916\u20131924). The basilica was not completed until 1914, when war intervened; it was formally dedicated in 1919 after World War I, when its national symbolism had shifted.\nConstruction costs, estimated at 7 million French francs and drawn entirely from private donations, were expended before any above-ground, visible structure was to be seen. A provisional chapel was consecrated 3 March 1876, and pilgrimage donations quickly became the mainstay of funding. Donations were encouraged by the expedient of permitting donors to \"purchase\" individual columns or other features as small as a brick. It was declared by the National Assembly that the state had the ultimate responsibility for funding.\nMuted echoes of the basilica's \"tortured history\" are still heard, geographer David Harvey has noted. In February 1971 demonstrators pursued by the police took refuge in the basilica and called upon their radical comrades to join them in occupying the church \"built upon the bodies of communards in order to efface that red flag that had for too long floated over Paris\" as their leaflets expressed it.\n\nHistorical images \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe overall style of the structure shows a free interpretation of Romano-Byzantine features, an unusual architectural vocabulary at the time, which was a conscious reaction against the neo-Baroque excesses of the Palais Garnier cited in the competition. Many design elements of the basilica symbolise nationalist themes: the portico, with its three arches, is adorned by two equestrian statues of French national saints Joan of Arc (1927) and King Saint Louis IX, both executed in bronze by Hippolyte Lefebvre; and the nineteen-ton Savoyarde bell (one of the world's heaviest), cast in 1895 in Annecy, alludes to the annexation of Savoy in 1860.\n\nSacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur is built of travertine stone quarried in Ch\u00e2teau-Landon (Seine-et-Marne), France.\nA mosaic in the apse entitled Christ in Majesty, created by Luc-Olivier Merson, is among the largest in the world.The basilica complex includes a garden for meditation, with a fountain. The top of the dome is open to tourists and affords a spectacular panoramic view of the city of Paris, which is mostly to the south of the basilica.\nThe use of cameras and video recorders is forbidden inside the basilica.\n\n\n== Pipe organ ==\n\nThe basilica is home to a large and very fine pipe organ built by Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll for a private home in Biarritz, composed of 109 ranks and 78 speaking stops spread across four 61-note manuals and the 32-note pedalboard (unusual before the start of the 20th century; the standard of the day was 56 and 30), spread across three expressive divisions (also unusual for the time, even in large organs). The organ was ahead of its time, containing multiple expressive divisions and giving the performer considerable advantages over other even larger instruments of the day. It was almost identical (tonal characteristics, layout, and casework) to the instrument in Sheffield's Albert Hall, destroyed by fire in 1937. However, when installed in Paris in 1905 by Cavaill\u00e9-Coll's successor and son-in-law, Charles Mutin, it lost its ornate case for a much plainer one.\n\n\n== Bells ==\nThe belfry of the basilica of the Sacred Heart of Montmartre  houses 5 bells, 4 small ones and a huge bourdon called \"The Savoyarde\", the biggest bell in France. It was cast on May 13, 1891 by the Paccard foundry (Dynasty of Georges, Hippolyte-Francisque and Victor (or G & F)) in Annecy-le-Vieux .\nThis bell is the fifth largest in Europe behind the Petersglocke of Cologne (Germany), the Olympic bell of London, Maria Dolens of Rovereto (Italy), and the Pummerin of Vienna (Austria), weighs 18,835 kg, measures 3,03 m of diameter for 9.60 m of outer circumference, with a base thickness of 22 cm and a leaf of 850 kg. With its accessories, its official weight reaches 19,685 kg. It was offered by the four dioceses of Savoy and the arrival of the fardier at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart on October 16, 1895, pulled by a team of 28 horses. It rang only for major religious holidays, especially on Easter, Pentecost, Ascension, Christmas, the Assumption and All Saints' Day; it could be heard 10 km away. However, since the late 1990s, a crack has appeared.\n\n\n== Role in Catholicism ==\n\nIn response to requests from French bishops, Pope Pius IX promulgated the feast of the Sacred Heart in 1856. The basilica itself was consecrated on 16 October 1919.\nSince 1885 (before construction had been completed) the Blessed Sacrament (Christ's body, consecrated during the Mass) has been continually on display in a monstrance above the high altar. Perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament has continued uninterrupted in the basilica since 1885. Tourists and others are asked to dress appropriately when visiting the basilica and to observe silence as much as possible, so as not to disturb persons who have come from around the world to pray in this place of pilgrimage, especially since there is the exposition of the Blessed Sacrament. Photos are not allowed to be taken in the Basilica.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe basilica is accessible by bus. Buses 30, 31, 80, and 85 can be taken to the bottom of the hill of the basilica. Line 12 of the metro can be taken to Jules Joffrin station and visitors can then change to the Montmartrobus and disembark at Place du Tertre. Line 2 or 12 of the metro can be taken to Pigalle station where visitors can change to the Montmartrobus and disembark at Norvins, or to Anvers station which gives easy access to the steps or the funicular car that lead directly to the basilica.  The Abbesses (Paris Metro) station could be a good choice as well, but is not wheelchair accessible.\nSacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur is open from 06:00 to 22:30 every day. The dome is accessible from 09:00 to 19:00 in the summer and to 18:00 in the winter.\n\n\n== Copy in Martinique ==\nA much smaller version of the basilica, Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de la Balata, is located north of Fort-de-France, Martinique, on N3, the main inland road.  Built for the refugees driven from their homes by the eruption of Mount Pel\u00e9e, it was dedicated in 1915.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSaint Margaret Mary Alacoque, seer and promoter of devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus\nBlessed Mary of the Divine Heart, promoter of the world consecration to the Sacred Heart of Jesus\nChurch of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a great shrine dedicated to the worship of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\nSanctuary of Christ the King, the Portuguese national shrine of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJacques Benoist, Le Sacre-Coeur de Montmartre de 1870 a nos Jours (Paris) 1992.

        "wiki": "Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: L\u00ebtzebuerg, French: Luxembourg, German: Luxemburg), also known as Luxembourg City (Luxembourgish: Stad L\u00ebtzebuerg or d'Stad, French: Ville de Luxembourg, German: Stadt Luxemburg, Luxemburg-Stadt), is the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the country's most populous commune. Standing at the confluence of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers in southern Luxembourg, the city lies at the heart of Western Europe, situated 213 km (132 mi) by road from Brussels, 372 km (231 mi) from Paris, and 209 km (130 mi) from Cologne. The city contains Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.\nAs of 31 December 2019, Luxembourg City has a population of 122,273 inhabitants, which is more than three times the population of the country's second most populous commune (Esch-sur-Alzette). The city's population consists of 160 nationalities. Foreigners represent 70% of the city's population, while Luxembourgers represent 30% of the population, and the number of foreign-born residents in the city rises steadily each year.In 2011, Luxembourg was ranked as having the second-highest per capita GDP in the world at $80,119 (PPP), with the city having developed into a banking and administrative centre. In the 2011 Mercer worldwide survey of 221 cities, Luxembourg was placed first for personal safety, while it was ranked 19th for quality of living.Luxembourg is one of the de facto capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg), as it is the seat of several institutions, agencies, and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, and Eurostat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Roman era, a fortified tower guarded the crossing of two Roman roads that met at the site of Luxembourg city. Through an exchange treaty with the abbey of Saint Maximin in Trier in 963, Siegfried I of the Ardennes, a close relative of King Louis II of France and Emperor Otto the Great, acquired the feudal lands of Luxembourg. Siegfried built his castle, named Lucilinburhuc (\"small castle\"), on the Bock Fiels (\"rock\"), mentioned for the first time in the aforementioned exchange treaty.\nIn 987, Archbishop Egbert of Trier consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael's Church). At a Roman road intersection near the church, a marketplace appeared around which the city developed.\nThe city, because of its location and natural geography, has through history been a place of strategic military significance. The first fortifications were built as early as the 10th century. By the end of the 12th century, as the city expanded westward around the new St. Nicholas Church (today the Cathedral of Notre Dame), new walls were built that included an area of 5 hectares (12 acres). In about 1340, under the reign of John the Blind, new fortifications were built that stood until 1867.\nIn 1443, the Burgundians under Philip the Good conquered Luxembourg. Luxembourg became part of the Burgundian, and later Spanish and Austrian empires (See Spanish Netherlands and Spanish Road) and under those Habsburg administrations Luxembourg Castle was repeatedly strengthened so that by the 16th century, Luxembourg itself was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. Subsequently, the Burgundians, the Spanish, the French, the Spanish again, the Austrians, the French again, and the Prussians conquered Luxembourg.\nIn the 17th century, the first casemates were built; initially, Spain built 23 km (14 mi) of tunnels, starting in 1644. These were then enlarged under French rule by Marshal Vauban, and augmented again under Austrian rule in the 1730s and 1740s.\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, the city was occupied by France twice: once, briefly, in 1792\u20133, and, later, after a seven-month siege. Luxembourg held out for so long under the French siege that French politician and military engineer Lazare Carnot called Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city's nickname: the 'Gibraltar of the North'.Nonetheless, the Austrian garrison eventually surrendered, and as a consequence, Luxembourg was annexed by the French Republic, becoming part of the d\u00e9partement of For\u00eats, with Luxembourg City as its pr\u00e9fecture. Under the 1815 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars, Luxembourg City was placed under Prussian military control as a part of the German Confederation, although sovereignty passed to the House of Orange-Nassau, in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis, the 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg to dismantle the fortifications in Luxembourg City. Their demolition took sixteen years, cost 1.5 million gold francs, and required the destruction of over 24 km (15 mi) of underground defences and 4 hectares (9.9 acres) of casemates, batteries, barracks, etc. Furthermore, the Prussian garrison was to be withdrawn.\n\nWhen, in 1890, Grand Duke William III died without any male heirs, the Grand Duchy passed out of Dutch hands, and into an independent line under Grand Duke Adolphe. Thus, Luxembourg, which had hitherto been independent in theory only, became a truly independent country, and Luxembourg City regained some of the importance that it had lost in 1867 by becoming the capital of a fully independent state.\nDespite Luxembourg's best efforts to remain neutral in the First World War, it was occupied by Germany on 2 August 1914. On 30 August, Helmuth von Moltke moved his headquarters to Luxembourg City, closer to his armies in France in preparation for a swift victory. However, the victory never came, and Luxembourg would play host to the German high command for another four years. At the end of the occupation, Luxembourg City was the scene of an attempted communist revolution; on 9 November 1918, communists declared a socialist republic, but it lasted only a few hours.In 1921, the city limits were greatly expanded. The communes of Eich, Hamm, Hollerich, and Rollingergrund were incorporated into Luxembourg City, making the city the largest commune in the country (a position that it would hold until 1978).\nIn 1940, Germany occupied Luxembourg again. The Nazis were not prepared to allow Luxembourgers self-government, and gradually integrated Luxembourg into the Third Reich by informally attaching the country administratively to a neighbouring German province. Under the occupation, the capital city's streets all received new, German names, which was announced on 4 October 1940. The Avenue de la Libert\u00e9 for example, a major road leading to the railway station, was renamed \"Adolf-Hitlerstra\u00dfe\". Luxembourg City was liberated on 10 September 1944. The city was under long-range bombardment by the German V-3 cannon in December 1944 and January 1945.\nAfter the war, Luxembourg ended its neutrality, and became a founding member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the European Parliament until 1981. Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Investment Bank. Several departments of the European Commission are also based in Luxembourg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe highest point of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is Kneiff at 560 m, closely followed by Burgplatz at 559 m and Napoleonsgaart at 554 m.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLuxembourg City lies on the southern part of the Luxembourg plateau, a large Early Jurassic sandstone formation that forms the heart of the Gutland, a low-lying and flat area that covers the southern two-thirds of the country.\nThe city centre occupies a picturesque site on a salient, perched high on precipitous cliffs that drop into the narrow valleys of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers, whose confluence is in Luxembourg City. The 70 m (230 ft) deep gorges cut by the rivers are spanned by many bridges and viaducts, including the Adolphe Bridge, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and the Passerelle. Although Luxembourg City is not particularly large, its layout is complex, as the city is set on several levels, straddling hills and dropping into the two gorges.\nThe commune of Luxembourg City covers an area of over 51 km2 (20 sq mi), or 2% of the Grand Duchy's total area. This makes the city the fourth-largest commune in Luxembourg, and by far the largest urban area. Luxembourg City is not particularly densely populated, at about 1,700 people per km2; large areas of Luxembourg City are maintained as parks, forested areas, or sites of important heritage (particularly the UNESCO sites), while there are also large tracts of farmland within the city limits.\n\n\n=== Quarters of Luxembourg City ===\n\nLuxembourg City is subdivided into twenty-four quarters (French: quartiers), which cover the commune in its entirety. The quarters generally correspond to the major neighbourhoods and suburbs of Luxembourg City, although a few of the historic districts, such as Bonnevoie, are divided between two quarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nConsidering its latitude, Luxembourg City has an oceanic climate, with moderate precipitation, cold to cool winters and warm summers. Moderate to heavy cloud cover is present for more than two-thirds of the year.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nUnder the Luxembourgian constitution, local government is centred on the city's communal council. Consisting of twenty-seven members (fixed since 1964), each elected every six years on the second Sunday of October and taking office on 1 January of the next year, the council is the largest of all communal councils in Luxembourg. The city is nowadays considered a stronghold of the Democratic Party (DP), which is the second-largest party nationally. Currently, the Democratic Party is the largest party on the council, with eleven councillors.The city's administration is headed by the mayor, who is the leader of the largest party on the communal council. After Xavier Bettel became Luxembourg's new prime minister on 4 December 2013, Lydie Polfer (DP) was sworn in as new mayor of Luxembourg on 17 December of the same year. The mayor leads the cabinet, the coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal, in which the DP forms a coalition with The Greens. Unlike other cities in Luxembourg, which are limited to four \u00e9chevins at most, Luxembourg is given special dispensation to have six \u00e9chevins on its coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal.\n\n\n=== National government ===\n\nLuxembourg City is the seat for the Luxembourg Government. The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg lives at Berg Castle in Colmar-Berg.\nFor national elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the city is located in the Centre constituency.\n\n\n=== European institutions ===\nLuxembourg City is the seat of several institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank. The majority of these institutions are located in the Kirchberg quarter, in the northeast of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDespite the city's comparatively small size, it has several notable museums: the recently renovated National Museum of History and Art (MNHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam) and National Museum of Natural History (NMHN). The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications. In addition to its two main theatres, the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Capucins, there is a new concert hall, the Philharmonie, as well as a conservatory with a large auditorium. Art galleries include the Villa Vauban, the Casino Luxembourg and Am Tunnel.Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, along with the Romanian city of Sibiu, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.\nLuxembourg City is also famed for its wide selection of restaurants and cuisines, including four Michelin starred establishments.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe ING Europe Marathon has been contested annually in the capital since June 2006. It attracted 11,000 runners and over 100,000 spectators during the 2014 edition\nThe Luxembourg Open is a tennis tournament held since 1991 in the capital. The tournament runs from 13 to 21 October. BGL BNP Paribas, one of the more famous sponsors in the world of tennis, was the contracted title sponsor of the tournament until 2014.\nThe D'Coque National Sporting and Cultural Centre, in the quarter of Kirchberg, is the largest sporting venue in the country, with a capacity of 8,300 for indoor sports and swimming.\nThe two football clubs of the city of Luxembourg; Racing FC Union Luxembourg and FC RM Hamm Benfica, play in the country's highest league, the Luxembourg National Division. The 8,000-seater Stade Josy Barthel hosts the Luxembourg national football team, and CAL Spora Luxembourg, which with 400 members is the nation's largest athletics club.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nPlaces of interest include the Gothic Revival Cathedral of Notre Dame, the fortifications, the AM Tunnel (an art gallery underground), the Grand Ducal Palace, the G\u00eblle Fra war memorial, the casemates, the Neum\u00fcnster Abbey, the Place d'Armes, the Adolphe Bridge and the city hall. The city is the home of the University of Luxembourg and RTL Group.\nThe Second World War Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial is located within the city limits of Luxembourg at Hamm. This cemetery is the final resting place of 5,076 American military dead, including General George S. Patton. There is also a memorial to 371 Americans whose remains were never recovered or identified.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nLuxembourg is situated in the heart of Europe in the Gold Triangle between Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam. It is therefore connected to several motorways and international routes.\n\nA1 (E44): to Grevenmacher and Trier (Germany).\nA3 (E25): to Dudelange and Thionville (France).\nA4: to Esch-sur-Alzette and to A13 to P\u00e9tange, Athus (Belgium) and Longwy (France)\nA6 (E25 / E411): to Arlon and Brussels.\nA7 (E421): to Mersch and Ettelbruck.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nLuxembourg City is served by five rail stations operated by the state rail company, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), including the principal station and terminus of all rail lines in the Grand Duchy, Luxembourg station. Stations in Luxembourg City are served by domestic rail services operated by CFL, as well as international rail services, operated by CFL,  and German, Belgian, and French service providers. Additionally, Luxembourg station is connected to the French LGV Est network, providing high-speed services on to Paris and Strasbourg. Services to Basel and Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland are available via two daily scheduled international trains.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nLuxembourg City has a network of 31 bus routes, operated by the municipal transport authority, Autobus de la Ville de Luxembourg (AVL), partly subcontracted to private bus companies. There is also a free bus service linking the Glacis to Luxembourg station, the \"Joker Line\" for seniors, and a \"City night network\". A \"Park & Ride\"  scheme is operated by the city with five carparks connected to the bus network. In addition to AVL buses, CFL and RGTR operate regional buses to other locales in Luxembourg and nearby cities in Germany and France.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\nOn 10 December 2017, the first stage of Luxembourg City's new tram line opened between Luxexpo and the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge serving the Kirchberg quarter. An extension to the city centre (St\u00e4replaz-\u00c9toile) was opened on 27 July 2018. Further extensions to Luxembourg station, Bonnevoie, Howald, and Cloche d\u2019Or are due to be completed by 2020/21.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLuxembourg City is served by the only international airport in the country: Luxembourg Airport (codes: IATA: LUX, ICAO: ELLX). Accessibility to the airport, situated in the commune of Sandweiler, 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from the city centre, is provided via the municipal bus network, with a tram connection due to be completed by 2021. The airport is the principal hub for Luxembourg's flag carrier, Luxair, and one of the world's largest cargo airlines, Cargolux.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLuxembourg is a member of the QuattroPole union of cities, along with Trier, Saarbr\u00fccken, and Metz (neighbouring countries: Germany and France).\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nLuxembourg is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Luxembourg City\nCessange\nEurovision Song Contest 1962, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1966, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1973, held at the  Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\nEurovision Song Contest 1984, held in the Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of Luxembourg City\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMakos, Adam (2019).

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge (Luxembourgish: Groussherzogin-Charlotte-Br\u00e9ck, French: Pont Grande-Duchesse Charlotte, German: Gro\u00dfherzogin-Charlotte-Br\u00fccke) is a road bridge in Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg. It carries the N51 across the Alzette, connecting Avenue John F. Kennedy, in Kirchberg, to Boulevard Robert Schuman, in Limpertsberg.  The bridge is also known as the Red Bridge (Luxembourgish: Rout Br\u00e9ck, German: Rote Br\u00fccke, French: Pont Rouge) on account of its distinctive red paintwork. It is the main route connecting the city centre, Ville Haute, to Kirchberg, the site of the city's European Union institutions.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe bridge was officially named after Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg during ceremony for the arrival of the first section of the support structure on 20 June 1963. Owing to the distinctive red colour coating of its box girder structure, residents have often referred to it as the \"Red Bridge\". Reaffirming this popular title for the bridge, LuxTram settled on the name of \"Rout Br\u00e9ck - Pafendal\", for its new tram stop immediately prior to the bridge on the Kirchberg approach, which opened on 10 December 2017.\n\n\n== Routes ==\nThe Grand Duchess Charlotte bridge carries motor vehicles, trams, pedestrians and bicycles. Together with its Kirchberg approach road, Avenue John F. Kennedy, and its Limbertsberg approach road, Boulevard Robert Schuman, the bridge forms part of the Luxembourg National Route  51 (N51). Since 28 July 2018, the bridge also forms part of the City Tram Line 1, operated by LuxTram, utilising rails installed in the surface of the deck during renovation works carried out from 2015 to 2018. Trams operating on the bridge section of the line, amongst others, use onboard batteries for traction power, charged by overhead lines elsewhere on the route. Additionally, the bridge's cycle lane is formally designated as part of Luxembourg's national Cycle Path 2, heading towards Echternach.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Design Competition ===\nIn 1952, following a failure between the partner countries to agree on a permanent location, Luxembourg became the temporary seat the institutions of the newly created European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). In 1957, the \"inner six\" states of the ECSC agreed to accelerate cooperation with the 1958 establishments of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) and the European Economic Community (EEC). In a bid to become the permanent 'capital' of what would later become known as the European Communities the Luxembourg Government sought to promote the development of the Kirchberg plateau for their use. However, the key factor in Kirchberg's largely undeveloped terrain, despite its proximity to the city centre, was its relative inaccessibility from the Luxembourg plateau, upon which Luxembourg City's historical centre is situated. In 1957, the Luxembourg Government launched a competition for designs of a bridge that would span the 75 m deep Pfaffenthal valley, through which the Alzette River flows, and link the Kirchberg plateau, with Limpertsberg, on the Luxembourg plateau. Sixty-nine designs were submitted with authorities settling on a winning design by German architect Egon Jux.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nConstruction work on the foundations of the bridge started on 20 April 1962, with the first segment of the bridge structure arriving on 20 June 1963, marked by a ceremony attended by the Government in the presence of Grand Duchess Charlotte. The components of the twin box girders forming the structure of the bridge were first assembled in Germany, before being transported, in 3 m by 13 m segments, to the site by train and then by road. The last box girder was lifted into place on 28 October 28, 1964, with construction works completed on 2 June 1965. The bridge was subjected to overload tests involving the simultaneous passage of twelve M48 Patton tanks, of 42 tons each, made available by the Belgian army. Finally, the bridge was officially opened to traffic on 24 October 1966 by Grand Duchess Charlotte.\n\n\n=== Renovations ===\nBetween 1980 and 1985, the bridge deck was resurfaced and in 1989 the bridge was repainted for the first time. Plexiglass safety barriers were erected in 1993.\nSignificant alterations and renovations to the bridge took place between 2015 and 2018, costing approximately 40 million euros, as part of plans to reintroduce trams to Luxembourg City's transport infrastructure. The road deck was strengthened and widened, and two tram lines were added, reducing road traffic from three to two lanes in each direction. Additionally, the bridge received a fresh coat of paint, new safety barriers, and new lighting.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Structure and Features ===\nThe Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge is of a batter-post rigid-frame bridge design. The inclined legs vary in length, with those on the Limpertsberg side measuring 40.6 m while those on the Kirchberg side measure 38.7 m.\nThe deck is 355 m in length and composed of three elements, respectively 95.42 m, 152.56 m and 107.02m in length. The road deck sits 75 meters above the Alzette River and is composed of an orthotropic slab of steel supported by two parallel box girders, each 6 m wide. The paved pedestrian footpaths, were originally 2.1 m each wide, with renovations carried out between 2015 and 2018, increasing this to 3.69 m on the south side, and 2.55 m on the north side. Either side of the width of the bridge deck is protected by a 2.70 m high safety barrier composed of stainless steel slats. In total, post the 2018 renovation works, the bridge deck width was increased from 25.07m to 26.58 m.\nPrior to the completion of renovation works in 2018, lighting was provided by conventional tall street lights lining the middle of the central traffic barrier on the bridge deck. Post renovation works, lighting is now diffused onto the bridge deck from LEDs mounted along the interior facing sides of the steel slat safety barriers, and either side of the traffic barrier separating directions of travel, at alternating intervals, with the aim to produce a more aesthetically pleasing look, and allow a direct line of sight from one side of the bridge to the other, unobscured by street lamps.\nThe total weight of the bridge is approximately 5,200 tonnes including 4,785 tonnes of steel.\nThe distinctive red paint coat of the box girder structure results from a deliberate decision by the designers to make the bridge noticeable, even in foggy or obscure conditions.\nRails attached to the interior of the box girders beneath the bridge deck, permit the use of a vehicular platform for bridge maintenance.\n\n\n=== Deck Layout ===\nFollowing the completion of the 2018 renovation works, the bridge deck layout, from north to south includes:\n\na 2.55 m wide pedestrian footpath;\na two-lane tramway, usable by emergency vehicles, with a total width of 6.60 m;\na 0.4 m safety buffer for road traffic;\na roadway consisting of two traffic lanes 3 m wide each, carrying traffic towards Limbertsberg;\na 1 m wide traffic buffer zone with barrier;\na roadway consisting of two traffic lanes 3 m wide each, carrying traffic towards Kirchberg;\na 0.4 m safety buffer for road traffic;\na 3.69 m wide lane marked for use as a pedestrian footpath and bidirectional bicycle path.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Development of Kirchberg's European District ===\nThough the EC, and later the European Union (EU), never decided on a single a seat for their basis, construction of the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge made it possible for Luxembourg City to today be considered one of the EU's three de facto capitals. Among other institutions based on Kirchberg are the Court of Justice of the EU, the European Investment Bank and the European Court of Auditors. The establishment of the European district in Kirchberg, led to the further successful urban development of the quarter promoted by the FondsKirchberg.\nIn 2016, for the fiftieth anniversary of the bridge, a postage stamp made by the German artist, Anita W\u00fcnschmann, and a 2 euro commemorative coin were issued.\n\n\n=== Suicides ===\nBetween the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge's opening in 1966 and the present day, more than 100 people have committed suicide by jumping off the bridge. In 1991, Luxembourgish director Genevi\u00e8ve Mersch (lb) shot a short 21-minute documentary, called \"The Red Bridge\" (lb), in which residents of Pfaffenthal, below the bridge detailed their gruesome and macabre experiences upon witnessing the aftermath of the suicides. In 1993 the Luxembourgish government decided to erect a Plexiglas safety barrier to prevent more suicides from happening. As part of renovation work on the bridge, these were replaced in 2017, with the new stainless steel slat design.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKinnen, Ferdinand (1967). \"Construction de Pont Grande-Duchesse Charlotte\" (PDF).

        "wiki": "The Fortress of Luxembourg refers to the former fortifications of Luxembourg City, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which were mostly dismantled in 1867. The fortress was of great strategic importance for the control of the Left Bank of the Rhine, the Low Countries, and the border area between France and Germany.\nThe fortifications were built gradually over nine centuries, from soon after the city's foundation in the tenth century until 1867. By the end of the Renaissance, Luxembourg was already one of Europe's strongest fortresses, but it was the period of great construction in the 17th and 18th centuries that gave it its fearsome reputation. Due to its strategic location, it became caught up in Europe-wide conflicts between the major powers such as the Habsburg\u2013Valois wars, the War of the Reunions, and the French Revolutionary Wars, and underwent changes in ownership, sieges, and major alterations, as each new occupier\u2014the Burgundians, French, Austrian and Spanish Habsburgs, and Prussians\u2014made their own improvements and additions.\nLuxembourg took pride in the flattering historical epithet of the \"Gibraltar of the North\" as a result of its alleged impregnability. By 1443 it had only been taken by surprise by Philip the Good. In 1795, the city, expecting imminent defeat and for fear of the following pillages and massacres, surrendered after a seven-month blockade and siege by the French, with most of its walls still unbreached. On this occasion, advocating to extend the revolutionary wars across the French borders, the French politician and engineer Lazare Carnot explained to the French House of Representatives, that in taking Luxembourg, France had deprived its enemies of \"...the best fortress in Europe after Gibraltar, and the most dangerous for France\", which had put any French movement across the border at a risk. Thus, the surrender of Luxembourg made it possible for France to take control of the southern parts of the Low Countries and to annex them to her territory.\nThe city's great significance for the frontier between the Second French Empire and the German Confederation led to the 1866 Luxembourg Crisis, almost resulting in a war between France and Prussia over possession of the German Confederation's main western fortress. The 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg's fortress to be torn down and for Luxembourg to be placed in perpetual neutrality, signalling the end of the city's use as a military site. Since then, the remains of the fortifications have become a major tourist attraction for the city. In 1994, the fortress remains and the city's old quarter were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== From Roman fortification to medieval castle ===\nIn Roman times, two roads crossed on the plateau above the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers, one from Arlon to Trier, and another leading to Thionville. A circular wooden palisade was built around this crossing, which could provide protection to the farmers of the region in case of danger. Not far from this, on the Bock promontory, was the small Roman fortification Lucilinburhuc \u2013 this name later turned into L\u00fctzelburg, and later still into Luxembourg.After the Romans had left, the fortification fell into disrepair, until in 963 Count Siegfried of the House of Ardennes, acquired the land in exchange for his territories in Feulen near Ettelbr\u00fcck from St. Maximin's Abbey in Trier. On the Bock promontory, he built a small castle, which was connected to the plateau through a drawbridge. In time, a settlement grew on the plateau. Knights and soldiers were billeted here on the rocky outcrop, while artisans and traders settled in the area beneath it, creating the long-standing social distinction between the upper and the lower city. The settlement had grown to a city by the 12th century, when it was protected by a city wall adjacent to the current Rue du Foss\u00e9. In the 14th century, a second city wall was built, which also incorporated the land of the Rham Plateau. A third one later incorporated the urban area as far as today's Boulevard Royal.\n\n\n=== Development and use as fortress ===\nThe reinforcement of the fortifications which had begun in 1320 under John the Blind continued until the end of the 14th century. In 1443 Philip the Good and his Burgundian troops took the city in a surprise attack by night. This started a period of foreign occupation for Luxembourg, which had been elevated from a County to a Duchy in 1354. Integrated into the territory of the Netherlands, it would be drawn into the duel between Valois-Bourbons and Habsburgs over the next few centuries, and was ruled by the Burgundians, the French, and the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs. During this time the fortress was continually expanded and extended, and fitted to the military requirements of the day. The casemates, constructed by the Spanish and Austrians, are of particular note.By marriage, the fortress passed in 1447 to the Austrian Habsburgs along with all Burgundian possessions. In 1542, the French troops of Francis I took the fortress, which was soon retaken by troops of the Holy Roman Empire. Around 1545, Italian and Dutch engineers under Holy Roman Emperor Charles V built the first bastions, linked by curtain walls, on the site of the current Boulevard Roosevelt and Boulevard Royal. The ditch was enlarged from 13 to 31 metres. Ravelins were also added.\n\n\n=== Spanish occupation ===\nLater, when the Spanish occupied the city, the aggressive policy of French King Louis XIV from 1670 led to the construction of additional fortifications. With a French attack seeming imminent, the Spanish engineer Louvigny constructed several fortified towers in front of the Glacis from 1672, such as the Redoubts Peter, Louvigny, Marie and Berlaimont; he also built the first barracks in the city. This formed a second line of defence around the city. Louvigny also envisaged constructing works on the other side of the P\u00e9trusse and Alzette valleys, but the Spaniards lacked the funds for this. He had, however, anticipated what the French would do after 1684.\n\n\n=== Expansion under Vauban ===\n\nAfter the successful siege by Louis XIV in 1683-1684, French troops regained the fortress under the renowned commander and military engineer S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban. From 1684 to 1688, Vauban immediately started a massive re-building and expansion project for the fortifications, using more than 3,000 men. Advance fortifications were placed on the heights around the city: the crownwork on Niedergr\u00fcnewald, the hornwork on Obergr\u00fcnewald, the \"Cornichon de Verlorenkost\", the Fort Bourbon and several redoubts. He greatly expanded the military's hold over the urban space by integrating Pfaffenthal into the defences, and large barracks were built on the Rham and Saint-Esprit plateaux. After the War of the Spanish Succession and the Peace of Ryswick, the fortress came under Spanish control from 1698, then passed to French administration again in 1701.\n\n\n=== Austrian period ===\nAfter the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the Dutch replaced the French for two years, after which Austrian troops regained it in 1715, remaining there for 80 years. The fortress of Luxembourg now formed one of the main strategic pillars in the defence of the Austrian Netherlands against French expansion. For this reason, Vauban's fortifications were reinforced and extended. It was under Charles VI and Maria Theresa that the fortress expanded the most in terms of surface area: the Austrian engineers added lunettes and several exterior forts (Olizy, Th\u00fcngen, Rubamprez, Rumigny, Neipperg, Wallis, Rheinsheim, Charles), closed off the valley with locks, and dug casemates into the rock. The fortress now had a triple line of defences on all sides.\n\n\n=== French Revolution and Prussian garrison ===\nAfter an 11-month blockade, the city of Luxembourg was taken by French Revolutionary troops in 1795. The Duchy of Luxembourg was now integrated as the \"D\u00e9partement des For\u00eats\" into the French Republic and later the French Empire. In 1815, after Napoleon's final defeat, the Congress of Vienna elevated Luxembourg to a Grand Duchy, now ruled in personal union by the King of the Netherlands. At the same time, Luxembourg became a member of the German Confederation, and the Luxembourgish fortress became a \"federal fortress\". To this effect, the Dutch King-Grand Duke essentially agreed to share responsibility for the fortress with Prussia, one of two major German powers. While the Dutch King remained fully sovereign, Prussia received the right to appoint the fortress governor, and the garrison would be made up of 1/4 Dutch troops and 3/4 Prussian troops. As a result, until 1867 around 4,000 Prussian officers, NCOs and men were stationed amongst a community of about 10,000 civilian residents. The fortress had already been garrisoned by Prussia since 8 July 1814, before the Congress of Vienna. The Prussians modernised the existing defences and added yet more advance forts, Fort Wedell and Fort Dumoulin. There were even plans to build a fourth line of defences, several kilometres from the city, to keep potential attackers even further at bay. This was not to take place, however.Officially, the Prussian garrison in Luxembourg operated as an instrument of the German Confederation. Yet since Austria, the other major German power, had given up its possessions in the Low Countries, Prussia had taken over the defence of the Western German states, and it was able to defend its own geopolitical interests as well as those of the Confederation. The timeline of its occupation of the fortress shows that Prussia was advancing its own agenda: it occupied the Luxembourg Fortress from 8 July 1814, before the Congress of Vienna had made it a federal fortress on 9 June 1815, and before the German Confederation even existed. Only after 11 years of the Prussian garrison was the fortress formally taken over by the Confederation on 13 March 1826, and it was not until one year after the Confederation dissolved (in 1866) that Prussian troops left the fortress, on 9 September 1867. Whether it was a federal fortress or not, Luxembourg was \"the most Westerly bulwark of Prussia\".According to Article 5 of the military convention signed in Frankfurt am Main on 8 November 1816 between the Kings of the Netherlands and of Prussia, the Fortress of Luxembourg was to be garrisoned by 1/4 Dutch troops and 3/4 Prussian troops. Article 9 stipulated that in times of peace the garrison should number 6,000 men, though this was temporarily lowered to 4,000 as the Allies were occupying France. In practice, the level of 6,000 men was never reached.In fact, the garrison consisted exclusively of Prussian troops: the Netherlands never provided their one-quarter of the garrison. Later, the Luxembourg-Prussian Treaty of 17 November 1856 gave Prussia the exclusive right to garrison troops in Luxembourg.In the 1830, the southern provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands broke off to form the Kingdom of Belgium. At the outbreak of this Belgian Revolution, most Luxembourgers joined the rebels, and from 1830 to 1839 almost all of Luxembourg was administered as part of Belgium. The fortress and city of Luxembourg, held by the Dutch and Prussian troops, was the only part of the country still loyal to the Dutch King William I. The stand-off was resolved in 1839, when the Treaty of London awarded the western part of Luxembourg to Belgium, while the rest (including the fortress) remained under William I.\n\n\n=== Luxembourg crisis and demolition ===\nAfter the Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the German Confederation was dissolved. In its place, under Prussian leadership, the North German Confederation was founded, which did not include Luxembourg. Nevertheless, Prussian troops remained in the fortress. Before the war, the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck had signalled to the French government of Napoleon III that Prussia would not object to French hegemony in Luxembourg, if France stayed out of Prussia's conflict with Austria, to which Napoleon agreed. After the war, the French offered King William III 5,000,000 guilder for his personal possession of Luxembourg, which the cash-strapped Dutch monarch accepted in March 1867. Prussian objections to what was now portrayed as French expansionism provoked the Luxembourg Crisis, and the threat of a war between the major powers was averted only by the London Conference and the Second Treaty of London. This declared Luxembourg to be a neutral state, and required the fortress to be torn down, and the Prussian garrison to leave within three months. Prussian troops finally left on 9 September 1867.Generally, it was usual for decommissioned fortresses to pass into the ownership of the cities concerned. In Luxembourg, however, an eagerness to comply with the Treaty of London and a fear of being caught up in a future Franco-German war caused the government to undertake the project on behalf of the city. The sale of the land of the fortress would fund the costs of demolition and of the urban development of the city. An international commission inspected the demolition work in 1883, bringing to light the government's inexperience with such work. The state had to decide between \"keeping everything\" and \"razing everything\". Military defensive works had to be interrupted by roads; military remains converted into cellars or warehouses had to be destroyed.The demolition of the fortress, with its casemates, batteries, barracks, and so on, took 16 years, from 1867 to 1883, and cost 1.5 million francs. The process was somewhat chaotic: often parts of the fortress were simply blown up, the usable materials carried off by local residents, and the rest was covered up with earth. Social concerns were not absent from the enterprise. The old barracks served as lodgings for the workers employed in the demolition work. No qualification was required to participate in this work: during times of economic downturn, additional demolition projects on the fortress gave work to the unemployed. The dismantling became a grandiose spectacle, and a celebration of new technologies and ambitious projects. Some buildings, however, were preserved for future generations (see below).\nLuxembourg achieved full independence in 1890 after the death of the Dutch king William III. He was succeeded in the Netherlands by his daughter Wilhelmina but as the succession laws of Luxembourg allowed only male heirs, the personal union came to an end. The Luxembourgers chose the German Duke Adolphe of the House of Nassau-Weilburg as their Grand Duke.\n\n\n=== Expansion of the city ===\nThis demolition work, which might be seen today as the destruction of a historic monument, was seen at the time as an act of liberation. The fortress was the very visible symbol of foreign domination, and additionally the various masters of the fortress forbade the building of new houses, so as not to influence the defensive military strategy at the heart of the fortress. When the corset of the fortifications had disappeared, the city could expand for the first time since the 14th century. In the West the Boulevard Royal was built, adjacent to the Municipal Park. In the south, the new Adolphe Bridge opened up the Bourbon Plateau for development, with its Avenue de la Libert\u00e9. Here, a harmonious blend of houses, imposing edifices (the Banque et Caisse d'\u00c9pargne de l'\u00c9tat, the ARBED building, the central railway station) and squares such as the Place de Paris were built.Additionally, the residential quarters of Limpertsberg and Belair were created.\n\n\n== Layout ==\nIn its final form, the fortress of Luxembourg consisted of three fortress walls, taking up about 180 ha (440 acres) at a time when the city covered only 120 ha (300 acres). Inside, there were a large number of bastions, with 15 forts in the centre, and another nine on the outside. A web of 23 km (14 mi) of underground passages (casemates) connected over 40,000 m2 (430,000 sq ft) of bomb-proof space. The epithet \"Gibraltar of the North\" compared the fortified city to the impregnable rock of Gibraltar. The fortress of Luxembourg was in fact never taken by force: in 1443, Philip the Good had taken it without opposition while subsequently the fortress was taken by siege leading to starvation.\nThe state of the fortress as of 1867 was as follows, in clockwise order: the Gr\u00fcnewald Front, facing north-east; the Trier Front, facing east; the Thionville Front, facing south, and the Longwy Front, facing west and north. These contained the following works:\n\n\n=== Land usage ===\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Luxembourg had been a relatively open city, with easy access through 23 gates. The ramparts delimited the urban space but allowed both people and goods to move between the town and the countryside without hindrance. This changed drastically from the mid-16th century, when fortifications cut the city off from the surrounding area.The defensive buildings, spread out over a large distance, rendered access to the city increasingly difficult: the fortress became a straitjacket for its inhabitants. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the gaps in the old medieval defences were closed off. The Marie gate was buried under Bastion Marie in 1548. The Lampert, Orvis, Beckerich and Jost gates disappeared in the early 17th century under the Berlaimont, Louis, Beck and Jost bastions. The military logic behind the need for an inaccessible fortress contrasted with that in favour of a merchant city, open to the outside. The 1644 closure of the Jews' gate, the city's main access from the West which had facilitated trade with the Netherlands, was a key date in this process. Traffic was obliged to bypass the plain, and enter by the New Gate (Porte-Neuve) built from 1626 to 1636. A traveller coming from France now had to descend into the Grund and come up through the Fishmarket, passing through several gates on the way.The Spanish government fully recognised that sealing off the city would stifle the economy and result in depopulation at a time when large numbers of civilians were needed to provide for the supply and lodging of the troops. Louvigny in 1671 drew up plans for a new gate on the rue Philippe and a bridge over the P\u00e9trusse valley, both of which would have brought about a considerable increase in trade and transportation. The plans, however, were never realized, probably owing to lack of funds.The fortress also came to be encircled by a kind of no man's land: the Austrians introduced a security perimeter in 1749, inside of which no permanent construction was allowed. This was in order to keep a clear field of fire, to keep the view unobstructed, and so as not to provide cover to attackers. Under the Prussians, the perimeter was extended to 979 m (3,212 ft) from the external lines of fortification. Luxembourg's first railway station, built in 1859 on the Plateau Bourbon, fell within the perimeter, and therefore had to be constructed out of wood.The growth of the fortress also meant the loss of agricultural land: from the Middle Ages, gardens, orchards, fields and meadows had formed a green belt around the city, and these disappeared progressively to make way for fortifications. The urban population, however, depended on this area for the city's supply of vegetables, fruit and fodder. The swallowing-up of agricultural fields accelerated when the Austrians extended the Glacis. Commander Neipperg had the earth removed down to the rock, a distance of 600 m (2,000 ft) from the fortress, so that attackers laying siege would have no opportunity to dig trenches. The rocky desert that surrounded the city was now called the \"bare fields\" (champs pel\u00e9s). Expropriations of land were often executed without discussion: the military would invoke the threat of war and a state of emergency, seizing plots of land without any compensation. In 1744, the garrison confiscated a plot of land close to the Eich gate in order to extend the defences. This land, and its garden of 48 fruit trees, belonged to three orphaned sisters, aged 9, 15 and 20, for whom the orchard was the only means of subsistence. The confiscation plunged them into destitution: when the soldiers chopped down the trees and the girls attempted to at least collect the firewood, they were chased off.It was not until the late 18th century that the authorities changed their attitude: the government in Brussels decided that compensation should be paid for confiscated property. The Austrians started to compensate for the previous decades' injustices by making payments to those who had been expropriated, or to their descendants.\n\n\n== Military rule ==\nEntering or exiting the city meant passing under the watchful eye of the soldiers on guard duty. At dusk, the gates would be shut, not to be re-opened until sunrise. Fear of an attack was not the only reason for closing the gates at night. In fact, for extended periods, especially in the late 18th century, there was little likelihood of being attacked. Yet even in times of good relations with the neighbouring French, the doors were shut: above all the military authorities feared their troops deserting. This was a constant plague for the Austrian army, as for all Ancien R\u00e9gime garrisons. Each year, a tenth of the troops would be lost to desertion, often escaping under the cover of darkness. In 1765, barbed wire was placed on the ramparts, to make night-time escapes more difficult. Paradoxically, the gate closure became more a matter of keeping the garrison inside than of protecting the city itself. However, those still outside the walls would have to hurry home when they heard the Zapestreech\u2014signalling the imminent gate closure\u2014if they wanted to avoid being locked out for the night. The Luxembourgish legend of Saint Nicholas (see below) refers to this.\n\n\n=== Living conditions and relations between garrison and inhabitants ===\n\n\n==== Lodging among civilians ====\n\nIn 1787, the citizens of Luxembourg stated in a petition that they had \"the sad privilege of living in a fortress, a privilege that is inseparable from the lodging of soldiers\". Living in a fortress city had serious disadvantages: the ramparts set serious limits on the amount of space available while the inhabitants had to share this small area with large numbers of troops. The further back one goes in history, the more difficult it is to locate exact numbers of both inhabitants and garrisoned soldiers.For the Spanish period, in 1684 the Prince of Chimay had 2,600 soldiers under his command (1,700 infantry and 900 cavalry). The military population was not limited to troops: many soldiers and officers also had wives and children. In 1655, in the upper town alone, a third of the 660 soldiers were listed as married, and about half of these families had children. Then there were also the servants employed by the officers. The total military population of the upper town was therefore 1,170, almost twice as many as the number of actual troops.Under the Austrian occupation, some 2,700 troops were stationed in the fortress in 1722, as compared to 4,400 in 1741 and 3,700 in 1790. In times of crisis or war, the garrison might be increased dramatically, as in 1727-1732 when the Austrians feared a French attack and 10,000 soldiers were stationed inside the fortress or in camps in the surroundings (while the civilian population was only 8,000). In the 19th century, there were 4,000 Prussian troops garrisoned in a city of about 10,000-13,000 residents.All of these had to be housed somewhere. Until 1672, when the first barracks were constructed, all officers, troops, and their wives and children, lived with the civilian inhabitants, leading to drastic overpopulation. A magistrate in 1679 noted that there were only 290 houses in the city, many of them tiny, owned by poor artisans with large families. These people, who barely eked out a living from one week to the next, only just had enough beds to sleep in themselves, never mind providing accommodation for a large number of soldiers who were \"crammed one on top of the other, experiencing first-hand the poverty and misery of their landlords\". The military's lists of billets give an idea of the cramped conditions in which troops and civilians co-existed: the butcher Jacques Nehr (listed in 1681) had a wife and five children. A room on the first floor of his house contained two married sergeants and three children. A second room housed a married soldier with his child, two gunners, and an infantryman. A dragoon lived above the stables. This was not an isolated case, and the justiciar and aldermen (\u00e9chevins) repeatedly protested to the government about the intolerable living arrangements.Living in such close proximity caused numerous frictions between soldiers and residents. In 1679, a magistrate complained that citizens had to give over \"three, four, five or six beds, along with linen and blankets\" to \"soldiers who were most often violent, drunk, and difficult, who mistreated them [...] stole their linen and furniture, and chased them from their own homes\". Ruffian soldiers would come home at night drunk, leaving the house doors open being noisy. The Spanish troops were apparently particularly undisciplined. When lodging in barracks was introduced, discipline improved considerably, though conflicts with residents did not disappear entirely. In the 18th century, there were still examples of Austrian officers who moved into rooms more spacious than the ones they had been assigned; others would bring girls of low repute to their house at night, to the alarm of their civilian landlords.This was all the more galling given that, under the Spaniards and Austrians, the city's inhabitants received no compensation for all this: they were to provide housing to the soldiers free of charge. The government claimed that since the garrison's presence brought trade and business which benefited the city's merchants and artisans, it was only fair for citizens to contribute by lodging the troops. Nor was the burden of quartering troops shared equally, by any means: there were many exemptions, reflecting the social inequality of the Ancien R\u00e9gime society. The justiciar, the aldermen, lawyers, members of the provincial council, and the nobility were exempt. The magistrates assigned soldiers to houses, and to this effect made lists with very detailed descriptions of houses' interiors. Abuses of power could not be prevented: the authorities were known to assign an excessive number of soldiers to the houses of residents who had been involved in disputes with the city. Citizens tried to wriggle out of these obligations by deliberately not keeping all rooms in their house fit for habitation; the wealthier inhabitants were able to avoid taking in soldiers by paying their way out.\n\n\n==== Introduction of barracks ====\n\nPurpose-built military accommodation was built in Luxembourg from 1672 onwards, with the barracks of Piquet and Porte-Neuve, as well as some huts on the Rham and Saint-Esprit plateaux. The barracks were enlarged and multiplied by Vauban after 1684, and by the Austrians and Prussians over the next two centuries. In 1774, the six barracks housed 7,900 troops, while the military hospital in Pfaffenthal had room for another 200 men. From the late 17th century, it became the norm for troops to reside in barracks; officers, on the other hand, continued to be quartered among civilians right up until the fortress's demolition in 1867. Even in Prussian times in the 19th century, most officers rented a room with their \"servis\", their accommodation allowance: as a result, the house-owners could at least receive payment.By this point, under the Prussian garrison, most of the soldiers were only in Luxembourg for short periods in connection with their military service. The aristocratic officers, on the other hand, were under strict social rules, and therefore intermarriages between the civilian population and the garrison soldiers were uncommon, except for non-commissioned officers, who were career soldiers. There was a love-hate relationship between inhabitants and garrison: on the one hand, there was jealousy over the soldiers' exemption from certain taxes and levies; on the other, the soldiers spent their wages in the city, and many businessmen and shopkeepers depended on the military for their livelihood, as did the craftsmen and day labourers who worked on improving or repairing the fortifications.Both groups suffered the same poor living conditions in the city, such as the lack of a clean water supply and of sanitation, leading to outbreaks of cholera and typhus. The barracks were so cramped that often two soldiers had to share a bed; the officers, quartered in the houses of the upper classes, did not experience such problems. Among the inhabitants, there was similar stratification: there was a marked difference between the dark, cramped housing of the poor in the lower town and the fine accommodation enjoyed by the rich who lived in housing in the upper town built by the nobility or the clergy.\n\n\n=== Animals ===\n\nAnimals were indispensable in order to maintain and run a fortress, and to feed its garrison. Riding horses, draught horses and workhorses were required while cattle, sheep or other animals were needed for slaughter.In 1814, the ground floors of the Rham Barracks, the Maria Theresa Barracks, and the riding barracks were renovated for use as stables. Out of the five storage buildings for grain and flour which had been built by 1795, the one in the upper town was used as a stable. Together, these had a capacity of 386 horses. By late 1819, the artillery required a new riding arena to train a large number of new horses that were being delivered. For this, they wanted to use the garden of an old monastery on the Saint-Esprit Plateau. By 1835, an indoor riding arena in the lower yard of the plateau had been completed. This had enough room to train a squadron, and in war time could be used as a livestock shed or as a fodder store.Apart from the riding horses of the cavalry detachment and officers, a large number of draught horses belonged to the artillery and military engineers for ensuring supplies. In case of emergency or when large-scale transport was necessary, contracts were signed with private haulage companies. The mill in the Cavalier Camus alone, which made enough flour daily for 1,500 portions of bread, required 24 horses to operate. Horsed units of artillery were ready for the rapid reinforcement of endangered fortress sections or to support a breakout. In 1859, Luxembourg had eight horse guns with 38 horses. There was also a need for additional horses to transport ammunition, as well as for riding and as reserves.Storage space for the animals' fodder had to be found. Oats were stored in the remaining churches after 1814. Straw posed a problem, due to the danger of its catching fire. It was to be stored either in the trenches of the Front of the plain, in Pfaffenthal, or in the lower quarters of the Grund and Clausen. The livestock intended for slaughter were to be accommodated among the inhabitants, with the gardens in the Grund and Pfaffenthal being reserved for cattle.Animals could also be a source of income for the military: already under the French, the fortress authorities sold off the grazing rights on the grassy areas of the Glacis. Due to lax supervision of grazing, however, by 1814, some of the folds were no longer recognisable as such.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Remains and later use ===\n\nParts of the fortress were not destroyed, but simply rendered unfit for military use. Many old walls and towers still survive, and still heavily influence the view of the city. Some of the remaining elements of the fortress are the Bock promontory, Vauban towers, the \"Three Towers\" (one of the old gates), Fort Th\u00fcngen, the towers on the Rham plateau, the Wenceslas Wall, the old cavalry barracks in Pfaffenthal, the Holy Ghost citadel, the casemates of the Bock and the P\u00e9trusse, the castle bridge, and some of the Spanish turrets. For its tourism industry, the modern-day city depends very heavily on its location as well as promoting the remains of the fortress and the casemates. The Wenzel and Vauban circular walks have been set up to show visitors the city's fortifications. The old fortifications and the city have been classed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1994.The old Fort Th\u00fcngen on the Kirchberg plateau has been heavily restored, and now houses a fortress museum.Fort Lambert, on the Front facing the plain, was covered over with earth after 1867. On this site, the Avenue Monterey was built. In 2001, construction work on an underground car park under the Avenue Monterey uncovered part of the Fort \u2013 one of its redoubts \u2013 which can now be seen by the public.Bastion Beck is now the Place de la Constitution, where the iconic G\u00eblle Fra statue is located.\n\n\n=== Place names ===\nMany street and building names in the city still serve as a reminder of the city's former military function, the defensive works, and of the foreign troops and administrators in Luxembourg:\n\nRue du Fort Rheinsheim, and the nearby \"Salle Rheinsheim\" of the Centre Convict (a meeting-place for religious and cultural organisations); also the headquarters of the \"S.A. Maria Rheinsheim\", which administers the real estate of the Catholic Church in Luxembourg\nRue du Fort Dumoulin\nRue du Fort Olisy\nRue Louvigny and the Villa Louvigny, which was built on the remains of Fort Louvigny, named after Jean Charles de Landas, Count of Louvigny, who was chief engineer and interim governor of the fortress in the 1670s\nRue du Foss\u00e9 (foss\u00e9: ditch)\nPlace d'Armes, French for \"parade ground\"\nRue Malakoff\nAvenue de la Porte-Neuve, after the \"New Gate\" (French: Porte Neuve)\nAvenue \u00c9mile-Reuter, was until 1974 called the Avenue de l'Arsenal (Lux: Arsenalstrooss, which is still used by some today), after an artillery detachment there \nRue Jean-Georges Willmar, named after a governor of Luxembourg (1815-1830)\nRue Vauban (in Clausen), after S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, the French military engineer who massively expanded Luxembourg's fortifications\nThe Glacis and the Rue des Glacis, a glacis being a slope of earth in front of defensive fortifications\nBoulevard Kaltreis (in Bonnevoie), used to be colloquially called \"op der Batterie\", as the French troops besieging the city had positioned their artillery here in 1794\nOn the Bourbon plateau, itself named after Fort Bourbon:Rue du Fort Bourbon\nRue du Fort Elisabeth \nRue du Fort Wallis\nRue du Fort Neipperg, after Wilhelm Reinhard von Neipperg, an Austrian general who was governor of Luxembourg five times in the 18th century\nRue Bender, after Blasius Columban von Bender, governor from 1785 to 1795\nRue du Fort Wedell\nOn the Kirchberg plateau:\nRue des Trois Glands and Rue du Fort Th\u00fcngen; the Fort, which has been mostly reconstructed, consists of three towers, hence nicknamed the \"Three Acorns\" (French: Trois Glands)\nRue du Fort Berlaimont\nRue du Fort Niedergr\u00fcnewald\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nA local version of a legend of Saint Nicholas (D'Seeche vum Zinniklos) refers to the danger of being shut outside the fortress gates for the night. Three boys were playing outside, and were far away from the city when the curfew was sounded: it was too late for them to return home. They sought refuge with a butcher who lived outside the city. At night-time, however, the butcher killed them to turn them into aspic. Luckily, a few days later, Saint Nicholas also found himself shut out of the city, and went to the same butcher's house. He found the children, and was able to bring them back to life.Jean Racine, the famous French dramatist, was in Luxembourg in 1687 as the historiographer of Louis XIV and inspector of the fortress.There are several elaborate maps and views of the fortress made before 1700. In 1598, Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg published the oldest known view of Luxembourg City, a copper engraving that appeared in Civitates orbis terrarum (Cologne, 1598). Half a century later, the Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu, drawing on Braun's work, published his \"Luxemburgum\" in the second volume of his Stedeboek (Amsterdam, 1649). Van der Meulen provides another view of Luxembourg from Limpertsberg where he depicts French troops taking the city in 1649.In more modern times, the British Romantic landscape artist J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851) painted several scenes of the fortress, both paintings and sketches, after visiting in 1824 and 1839. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe visited the city in 1792, and left a number of sketches of the fortress. Christoph Wilhelm Selig, a member of the Hessian garrison (1814-1815), painted several watercolours. Later, the fortress served as a model for the Luxembourgers Michel Engels and Nicolas Liez and Jean-Baptiste Fresez. Even after the dismantling of (most of) the fortifications in 1867, the spectacular remains have still been used as motifs by artists such as Joseph Kutter or Sosth\u00e8ne Weis.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nFort Th\u00fcngen\nSiege of Luxembourg (1684)\nSiege of Luxembourg (1794\u201395)\nFortresses of the German Confederation\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References and further reading ==\nBruns, Andr\u00e9.

        "wiki": "Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: L\u00ebtzebuerg, French: Luxembourg, German: Luxemburg), also known as Luxembourg City (Luxembourgish: Stad L\u00ebtzebuerg or d'Stad, French: Ville de Luxembourg, German: Stadt Luxemburg, Luxemburg-Stadt), is the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the country's most populous commune. Standing at the confluence of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers in southern Luxembourg, the city lies at the heart of Western Europe, situated 213 km (132 mi) by road from Brussels, 372 km (231 mi) from Paris, and 209 km (130 mi) from Cologne. The city contains Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.\nAs of 31 December 2019, Luxembourg City has a population of 122,273 inhabitants, which is more than three times the population of the country's second most populous commune (Esch-sur-Alzette). The city's population consists of 160 nationalities. Foreigners represent 70% of the city's population, while Luxembourgers represent 30% of the population, and the number of foreign-born residents in the city rises steadily each year.In 2011, Luxembourg was ranked as having the second-highest per capita GDP in the world at $80,119 (PPP), with the city having developed into a banking and administrative centre. In the 2011 Mercer worldwide survey of 221 cities, Luxembourg was placed first for personal safety, while it was ranked 19th for quality of living.Luxembourg is one of the de facto capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg), as it is the seat of several institutions, agencies, and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, and Eurostat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Roman era, a fortified tower guarded the crossing of two Roman roads that met at the site of Luxembourg city. Through an exchange treaty with the abbey of Saint Maximin in Trier in 963, Siegfried I of the Ardennes, a close relative of King Louis II of France and Emperor Otto the Great, acquired the feudal lands of Luxembourg. Siegfried built his castle, named Lucilinburhuc (\"small castle\"), on the Bock Fiels (\"rock\"), mentioned for the first time in the aforementioned exchange treaty.\nIn 987, Archbishop Egbert of Trier consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael's Church). At a Roman road intersection near the church, a marketplace appeared around which the city developed.\nThe city, because of its location and natural geography, has through history been a place of strategic military significance. The first fortifications were built as early as the 10th century. By the end of the 12th century, as the city expanded westward around the new St. Nicholas Church (today the Cathedral of Notre Dame), new walls were built that included an area of 5 hectares (12 acres). In about 1340, under the reign of John the Blind, new fortifications were built that stood until 1867.\nIn 1443, the Burgundians under Philip the Good conquered Luxembourg. Luxembourg became part of the Burgundian, and later Spanish and Austrian empires (See Spanish Netherlands and Spanish Road) and under those Habsburg administrations Luxembourg Castle was repeatedly strengthened so that by the 16th century, Luxembourg itself was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. Subsequently, the Burgundians, the Spanish, the French, the Spanish again, the Austrians, the French again, and the Prussians conquered Luxembourg.\nIn the 17th century, the first casemates were built; initially, Spain built 23 km (14 mi) of tunnels, starting in 1644. These were then enlarged under French rule by Marshal Vauban, and augmented again under Austrian rule in the 1730s and 1740s.\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, the city was occupied by France twice: once, briefly, in 1792\u20133, and, later, after a seven-month siege. Luxembourg held out for so long under the French siege that French politician and military engineer Lazare Carnot called Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city's nickname: the 'Gibraltar of the North'.Nonetheless, the Austrian garrison eventually surrendered, and as a consequence, Luxembourg was annexed by the French Republic, becoming part of the d\u00e9partement of For\u00eats, with Luxembourg City as its pr\u00e9fecture. Under the 1815 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars, Luxembourg City was placed under Prussian military control as a part of the German Confederation, although sovereignty passed to the House of Orange-Nassau, in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis, the 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg to dismantle the fortifications in Luxembourg City. Their demolition took sixteen years, cost 1.5 million gold francs, and required the destruction of over 24 km (15 mi) of underground defences and 4 hectares (9.9 acres) of casemates, batteries, barracks, etc. Furthermore, the Prussian garrison was to be withdrawn.\n\nWhen, in 1890, Grand Duke William III died without any male heirs, the Grand Duchy passed out of Dutch hands, and into an independent line under Grand Duke Adolphe. Thus, Luxembourg, which had hitherto been independent in theory only, became a truly independent country, and Luxembourg City regained some of the importance that it had lost in 1867 by becoming the capital of a fully independent state.\nDespite Luxembourg's best efforts to remain neutral in the First World War, it was occupied by Germany on 2 August 1914. On 30 August, Helmuth von Moltke moved his headquarters to Luxembourg City, closer to his armies in France in preparation for a swift victory. However, the victory never came, and Luxembourg would play host to the German high command for another four years. At the end of the occupation, Luxembourg City was the scene of an attempted communist revolution; on 9 November 1918, communists declared a socialist republic, but it lasted only a few hours.In 1921, the city limits were greatly expanded. The communes of Eich, Hamm, Hollerich, and Rollingergrund were incorporated into Luxembourg City, making the city the largest commune in the country (a position that it would hold until 1978).\nIn 1940, Germany occupied Luxembourg again. The Nazis were not prepared to allow Luxembourgers self-government, and gradually integrated Luxembourg into the Third Reich by informally attaching the country administratively to a neighbouring German province. Under the occupation, the capital city's streets all received new, German names, which was announced on 4 October 1940. The Avenue de la Libert\u00e9 for example, a major road leading to the railway station, was renamed \"Adolf-Hitlerstra\u00dfe\". Luxembourg City was liberated on 10 September 1944. The city was under long-range bombardment by the German V-3 cannon in December 1944 and January 1945.\nAfter the war, Luxembourg ended its neutrality, and became a founding member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the European Parliament until 1981. Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Investment Bank. Several departments of the European Commission are also based in Luxembourg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe highest point of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is Kneiff at 560 m, closely followed by Burgplatz at 559 m and Napoleonsgaart at 554 m.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLuxembourg City lies on the southern part of the Luxembourg plateau, a large Early Jurassic sandstone formation that forms the heart of the Gutland, a low-lying and flat area that covers the southern two-thirds of the country.\nThe city centre occupies a picturesque site on a salient, perched high on precipitous cliffs that drop into the narrow valleys of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers, whose confluence is in Luxembourg City. The 70 m (230 ft) deep gorges cut by the rivers are spanned by many bridges and viaducts, including the Adolphe Bridge, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and the Passerelle. Although Luxembourg City is not particularly large, its layout is complex, as the city is set on several levels, straddling hills and dropping into the two gorges.\nThe commune of Luxembourg City covers an area of over 51 km2 (20 sq mi), or 2% of the Grand Duchy's total area. This makes the city the fourth-largest commune in Luxembourg, and by far the largest urban area. Luxembourg City is not particularly densely populated, at about 1,700 people per km2; large areas of Luxembourg City are maintained as parks, forested areas, or sites of important heritage (particularly the UNESCO sites), while there are also large tracts of farmland within the city limits.\n\n\n=== Quarters of Luxembourg City ===\n\nLuxembourg City is subdivided into twenty-four quarters (French: quartiers), which cover the commune in its entirety. The quarters generally correspond to the major neighbourhoods and suburbs of Luxembourg City, although a few of the historic districts, such as Bonnevoie, are divided between two quarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nConsidering its latitude, Luxembourg City has an oceanic climate, with moderate precipitation, cold to cool winters and warm summers. Moderate to heavy cloud cover is present for more than two-thirds of the year.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nUnder the Luxembourgian constitution, local government is centred on the city's communal council. Consisting of twenty-seven members (fixed since 1964), each elected every six years on the second Sunday of October and taking office on 1 January of the next year, the council is the largest of all communal councils in Luxembourg. The city is nowadays considered a stronghold of the Democratic Party (DP), which is the second-largest party nationally. Currently, the Democratic Party is the largest party on the council, with eleven councillors.The city's administration is headed by the mayor, who is the leader of the largest party on the communal council. After Xavier Bettel became Luxembourg's new prime minister on 4 December 2013, Lydie Polfer (DP) was sworn in as new mayor of Luxembourg on 17 December of the same year. The mayor leads the cabinet, the coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal, in which the DP forms a coalition with The Greens. Unlike other cities in Luxembourg, which are limited to four \u00e9chevins at most, Luxembourg is given special dispensation to have six \u00e9chevins on its coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal.\n\n\n=== National government ===\n\nLuxembourg City is the seat for the Luxembourg Government. The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg lives at Berg Castle in Colmar-Berg.\nFor national elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the city is located in the Centre constituency.\n\n\n=== European institutions ===\nLuxembourg City is the seat of several institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank. The majority of these institutions are located in the Kirchberg quarter, in the northeast of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDespite the city's comparatively small size, it has several notable museums: the recently renovated National Museum of History and Art (MNHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam) and National Museum of Natural History (NMHN). The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications. In addition to its two main theatres, the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Capucins, there is a new concert hall, the Philharmonie, as well as a conservatory with a large auditorium. Art galleries include the Villa Vauban, the Casino Luxembourg and Am Tunnel.Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, along with the Romanian city of Sibiu, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.\nLuxembourg City is also famed for its wide selection of restaurants and cuisines, including four Michelin starred establishments.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe ING Europe Marathon has been contested annually in the capital since June 2006. It attracted 11,000 runners and over 100,000 spectators during the 2014 edition\nThe Luxembourg Open is a tennis tournament held since 1991 in the capital. The tournament runs from 13 to 21 October. BGL BNP Paribas, one of the more famous sponsors in the world of tennis, was the contracted title sponsor of the tournament until 2014.\nThe D'Coque National Sporting and Cultural Centre, in the quarter of Kirchberg, is the largest sporting venue in the country, with a capacity of 8,300 for indoor sports and swimming.\nThe two football clubs of the city of Luxembourg; Racing FC Union Luxembourg and FC RM Hamm Benfica, play in the country's highest league, the Luxembourg National Division. The 8,000-seater Stade Josy Barthel hosts the Luxembourg national football team, and CAL Spora Luxembourg, which with 400 members is the nation's largest athletics club.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nPlaces of interest include the Gothic Revival Cathedral of Notre Dame, the fortifications, the AM Tunnel (an art gallery underground), the Grand Ducal Palace, the G\u00eblle Fra war memorial, the casemates, the Neum\u00fcnster Abbey, the Place d'Armes, the Adolphe Bridge and the city hall. The city is the home of the University of Luxembourg and RTL Group.\nThe Second World War Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial is located within the city limits of Luxembourg at Hamm. This cemetery is the final resting place of 5,076 American military dead, including General George S. Patton. There is also a memorial to 371 Americans whose remains were never recovered or identified.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nLuxembourg is situated in the heart of Europe in the Gold Triangle between Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam. It is therefore connected to several motorways and international routes.\n\nA1 (E44): to Grevenmacher and Trier (Germany).\nA3 (E25): to Dudelange and Thionville (France).\nA4: to Esch-sur-Alzette and to A13 to P\u00e9tange, Athus (Belgium) and Longwy (France)\nA6 (E25 / E411): to Arlon and Brussels.\nA7 (E421): to Mersch and Ettelbruck.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nLuxembourg City is served by five rail stations operated by the state rail company, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), including the principal station and terminus of all rail lines in the Grand Duchy, Luxembourg station. Stations in Luxembourg City are served by domestic rail services operated by CFL, as well as international rail services, operated by CFL,  and German, Belgian, and French service providers. Additionally, Luxembourg station is connected to the French LGV Est network, providing high-speed services on to Paris and Strasbourg. Services to Basel and Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland are available via two daily scheduled international trains.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nLuxembourg City has a network of 31 bus routes, operated by the municipal transport authority, Autobus de la Ville de Luxembourg (AVL), partly subcontracted to private bus companies. There is also a free bus service linking the Glacis to Luxembourg station, the \"Joker Line\" for seniors, and a \"City night network\". A \"Park & Ride\"  scheme is operated by the city with five carparks connected to the bus network. In addition to AVL buses, CFL and RGTR operate regional buses to other locales in Luxembourg and nearby cities in Germany and France.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\nOn 10 December 2017, the first stage of Luxembourg City's new tram line opened between Luxexpo and the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge serving the Kirchberg quarter. An extension to the city centre (St\u00e4replaz-\u00c9toile) was opened on 27 July 2018. Further extensions to Luxembourg station, Bonnevoie, Howald, and Cloche d\u2019Or are due to be completed by 2020/21.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLuxembourg City is served by the only international airport in the country: Luxembourg Airport (codes: IATA: LUX, ICAO: ELLX). Accessibility to the airport, situated in the commune of Sandweiler, 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from the city centre, is provided via the municipal bus network, with a tram connection due to be completed by 2021. The airport is the principal hub for Luxembourg's flag carrier, Luxair, and one of the world's largest cargo airlines, Cargolux.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLuxembourg is a member of the QuattroPole union of cities, along with Trier, Saarbr\u00fccken, and Metz (neighbouring countries: Germany and France).\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nLuxembourg is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Luxembourg City\nCessange\nEurovision Song Contest 1962, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1966, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1973, held at the  Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\nEurovision Song Contest 1984, held in the Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of Luxembourg City\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMakos, Adam (2019).

          "I had the pleasure to hear Maria Joao Pires play Mozart at this concert hall. I did not manage to get very good seats, but I must say I was astonished at the perfect acoustics. I was able to hear every little nuance of the performance. Congratulations to the architects.",

Opened in July 2012 in the fully restored 18th-century Fort Th\u00fcngen, its permanent exhibition traces Luxembourg's history from 1443 to 1903.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum is housed in the fully restored Fort Th\u00fcngen, built by the Austrians in 1732 to reinforce the Fortress of Luxembourg. In 1836 and in 1859\u201360, it was extended by the Prussians forming part of the outer defences known as the Gr\u00fcnewald Front (Front de Gr\u00fcnewald). As a consequence of the 1867 Treaty of London, most of the building was demolished apart from its three rounded turrets, colloquially known as Dr\u00e4i Eechelen (Luxembourgish) or Les Trois Glands (French), meaning \"The Three Acorns\".In 1996, the Luxembourg authorities approved the development of a so-called Mus\u00e9e de la Forteresse (Fortress Museum) in Fort Th\u00fcngen with a view to \"illustrating and explaining the nature of the fortress of Luxembourg in regard to the history of the city, the territorial development of the country and the cultural identity of the nation\".The museum forms part of Luxembourg's National Museum of History and Art.\n\n\n== Permanent exhibition ==\nSome 600 artefacts in the permanent exhibition illustrate the history of the city and country of Luxembourg from the Burgundian conquest in 1443 to the construction of the Adolphe Bridge in 1903. They are exhibited in a series of casemates (or underground galleries), six of which cover specific periods from the medieval fortress (1443-1643) to the height of the city's development (1883-1903). Two further casemates house a multimedia room and a series of photographs illustrating the city and the fortress in the 19th century.With its striking underground galleries and passageways, the building itself forms an important part of the permanent exhibition. It has been restored to reflect the last phase of its original expansion in 1837.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Luxembourg\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Vianden Castle (French: Ch\u00e2teau de Vianden, German: Burg Vianden Luxembourgish: Buerg Veianen), located in Vianden in the north of Luxembourg, is one of the largest fortified castles west of the Rhine. With origins dating from the 10th century, the castle was built in the Romanesque style from the 11th to 14th centuries. Gothic transformations and trimmings were added at the end of this period. A Renaissance mansion was added in the 17th century but thereafter the castle was allowed to fall into ruins. It has, however, recently been fully restored and is open to visitors.\n\n\n== Location ==\nSet on a rocky promontory, the castle stands at a height of 310 metres (1,020 ft), dominating the town of Vianden and overlooking the River Our about one hundred metres (330 ft) below. The castle and its dependent buildings have a total length of 90 metres (300 ft).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe castle was built on the site of an ancient Roman castellum. The basement appears to have been a Carolingian refuge. Historically, the first Count of Vianden was mentioned in 1090. The castle continued to be the seat of the Vianden's influential counts until the beginning of the 15th century.Around 1100, a square keep was built as well as a kitchen, a chapel and residential rooms indicating that an aristocratic family lived there at the time. During the first half of the 12th century, a new residential tower and a prestigious decagonal chapel were added while the palace itself was extended. At the beginning of the 13th century, a new two-storey palace measuring 10 by 13 metres (33 by 43 ft) was built with a sumptuous gallery connecting it to the chapel. These additions show how the Counts of Vianden sought to rival the House of Luxembourg. The last great change took place in the middle of the 13th century when the entire castle was adapted to reflect the Gothic style. Finally, in 1621 the Nassau Mansion with its banqueting hall and bedroom was built by Prince Maurice of Orange-Nassau-Vianden in the Renaissance style replacing a damaged side wing of the 11th century keep.During the 16th century, the castle was more or less abandoned by the Counts of Vianden who had gained the additional title of the House of Nassau-Orange after Elisabeth, the granddaughter of Henry II of Vianden had willed the County of Vianden together with its castle to her cousin, Count Engelbert of Nassau. This initiated the long association between Vianden and the House of Nassau. In 1564, William the Silent, Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau and of Vianden, took an initial interest in Vianden where he built the first blast furnace in Luxembourg but left in 1566 to lead the Dutch revolt against King Philip II of Spain. As a result, Philip confiscated the castle and conferred it on Peter Ernst von Mansfeld, the governor of Luxembourg.In 1820, King William I sold the castle to Wenzel Coster, an alderman, for 3,200 florins. Coster started to demolish the building, selling off the tiles from the roof, the wooden panelling, the doors and the windows piece by piece. Soon the castle was a ruin.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\n\nSuch was the indignation of his subjects at the mistreatment of the castle that in 1827 the king, himself a Count of Vianden, repurchased the ruin for 1,100 florins hoping to begin restoration work. Unfortunately, his time was taken up with the Belgian Revolution of 1830 and it was not until 1851 that Prince Henry of the Netherlands reconstructed the chapel at his own expense, giving it a lower roof. When Adolphe of Nassau-Weilbourg became Grand Duke of Luxembourg in 1890, he charged Bobo Ebhardt, a German specialist, with further restoration. Although Ebhardt succeeded in making important progress, his work was interrupted by the First World War.During the Second World War, in the Battle of Vianden which took place on November 19, 1944, the castle was ably defended against the Waffen-SS by members of the Luxembourgish anti-Nazi resistance, and proved to have some military value even under conditions of modern warfare. \nIt was not until 1962 that consideration was again given to restoration, resulting in reconstruction of the Armory. Further progress was hampered by questions of the castle's ownership. Only after Grand Duke Jean had ceded the castle to the State in 1977 did work continue. In 1978, attention turned to rebuilding the walls, the gables and the roof. In 1979, the chapel was also given a new roof and restored to reflect its original Gothic appearance, which had been lost during the fire of 1667 caused by lightning. The white tower was also reinforced and topped with a conical roof. Finally, after the Nassau Mansion was fully restored in 1981\u201382, efforts were made to refurnish the interior as authentically as possible. This work was completed in 1990.\n\n\n== The castle today ==\nThe castle is open to visitors throughout the year from 10 am to 4 pm every day. In March and October, the closing time is extended to 5 pm and in the summer months to 6 pm. Guided tours are also available.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nYolanda of Vianden\nList of castles in Luxembourg\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Official website\".

          "Very beautiful castle, inside and outside. You pay a normal fee to get inside (\u20ac7 per person). The tour we took through the castle ourselves, but there is also a tour on record.

          "I like two things about the whole experience there: the beautiful view on the terrace and the well-made video at the museum at the entrance. \nI feel quite bad that it lacks information inside the castle so I basically walked around without knowing much (luckily the movie at the end helps fill that gap a bit).",
          "Beautiful restaurated castle. Worth every minute you spend here. Go there and watch.",

          "Beautiful castle inside and out! It was 7\u20ac to get in the gates and explore. A lot of history to be seen inside and worth the 7\u20ac. Gorgeous views from the balconies and windows. When you\u2019re done exploring the castle head on into Vianden and enjoy the old village\u2019s charm.",
          "Amazing! History presented in the 21st century! Loved the augmented reality app and the tour! Highly recommended for anyone traveling through Luxembourg! From the 4th century it's been added to until you get this magnificent castle!",

          "I'd recommend getting the audio tour if you're anything but french or German. Nothing is described on plates in other languages or isn't described at all.\nYou're left with pretty pictures and sights which at least counts for something.",
          "Perfectly routed and the audio guide provided enough information to entertain for almost 3 hours. Final stop is the cellar where the temperature is 10-12 degree celsius year round. Really pleasant to cool down from the hot summer sun.",
          "One of our favourite things to do every time we visit Wiltz, Luxembourg. \n\nWe went here with a group of scouts, age 16-18. A fun activity full of culture and history for about 2 hours (max).",

There are 21 chambers and takes around 2 hours for a trip inside the castle. Not recommended if you are traveling with elderly family members.",
          "Average castle with many famous celebrities who visited this place and have their pictures kept their. Rest dont miss the hill chair experience it was good.",
          "The chairlift will give you some very nice views, it is not direct to the castle though, it requires a 6 minutes hike. It was great on summer, it can be viewed from restaurants on the other side of the river, lovely. Entry and chairlift is \u2026",

          "Because we had a tight schedule and little money, we didn't go inside (now I regret it) but it was nice to see from the outside. It was my first trip to Europe and the first castle I saw in my life so I was super impressed",
          "Vianden Castle was built between the 11th and 14th Century on the foundations of a Roman castle and a Carolingian refuge. This Castle-Palace bears the Hohenstaufen characteristics and is one of the largest and finest feudal residences of the Roman and Gothic eras in Europe. The",

          "The castle is fairly easy to get to on public transport via train from Luxembourg and a short bus journey. Approx 1 hour 30. There are beautiful views both outside and from the castle itself. The castle is heaped in history. There isn\u2019t much information, unless you get the",
          "It took us 30 minutes to make it to the castle on foot,quite steep but kept stopping for a breather,at a modest cost of \u20ac6 for a senior it was fantastic value,so well signposted for the tour circuit to take it makes sure you do not miss a thing,all information along with slide",

          "Very picturesque. We did not go inside. From afar it looks great. It's nestled amongst thick green forests on a hill, making a stunning picture. Best views are from the chairlift that's opposite.",
          "Had looked forward to visiting since seeing so many lovely pictures. It was beautiful, but nearly everything in town closed since we could only visit on a Sunday. Had not realized how far walk was from bus station. Castle lovely on outside, but interior didn't include many",

          "Fair entree price for a castle that has been renovated providing a staight foreward walking tour that takes around 45 minutes. Viande is beautifully located and an excellent place for scenic walks and other outdoor activities.",
          "I happen to love castles, so this was a must do for me! I enjoyed the visit and the 2.00 euros extra for the tutorial was well worth it! The town itself is cute and charming! If you have the time I\u2019d make the 35 minute trip from Luxembourg city!",
          "It's one of those places that you can't quite judge through photos or via reviews unless you've been there yourself. It's not quite the castle itself but the whole area that is so lovely. Cannot help but relate to the Hogwarts castle. A very memorable experience indeed.",
          "Loved Vianden town and its castle! The castle is very well built and preserved Highly recommended if u are into historical sites and castles",

          "This hilltop fortress is about a half hour drive from Luxembourg and offers some good insight into the living of the 11th&14th century. In late July beginning of August there is a middle ages festival with an interesting program and worth to experience. But even just visiting",
          "It's a must visit in Luxembourg. It's about 1 hour by train and bus and 1.5 hours by two buses, but you cannot miss it while in Luxembourg. The Vianden town is a small beautiful town by Our river. Take the left of the river and go to the chairlift boarding point. The chairlift",
          "A must-see for tourists to Luxembourg. A medieval fortress which towers over the surrounding countryside The castle has been rebuilt from a ruin and is very impressive inside and out. Don't miss the excellent visitors' centre adjacent to the cafe which has a superb exhibition",

          "The last time I visited the Castle was about 8 years ago. What a difference with the past. Nowadays it is very complete with nice possibilities for kids to play. The visitors centre is really nice to quickly learn about the Castle\u2019s history. A must if you want to know just a",
          "As the title says, I do not understand the negative feedback. The castle is as astounding from the outside as it is on the inside. I found the \"self-tour\", where you had to follow the route across the rooms and halls, charming, the view spectacular and the renovations lovely.",
          "The castle is a joy to walk thru. The structured tour route and audio guide is well organized and informative. The views of the valley and town below are beautiful. The effort put forth in the reconstruction is amazing and very impressive, as well as very carefully researched.",
          "First of all I highly recommend taking the chair lift up the hill to get here as it is only a short walk from the chair lift to the castle. There was a little bit of a wait time to get tickets and the audio guide speaker but after that the crowd was okay. The castle itself was",
          "For the traveller interested in history: this is a very nice excursion. The castle is being rebuild from a ruin, started in 1972 by the Luxemburg gouvernement.",
          "There was a festival when I was there. So it was packed full of people which made it hard to see everything about the castle. Festival was fun but not what I was expecting. Wish I could tell you more about the castle but there were vendors and people literally everywhere.",
          "Very nice castle located above the really nice village of Vianden. On the day of the visit there was a medieval festival inside the castle, which in a way was nice to see, however the castle was very crowded and the Luxembourg Card was not valid. Unfortunately no one warned us",
          "Some great rooms, including a walk through the foundations. Fantastic views from the top. Nice little cafe and shop also.",
          "We were lucky to find a parking space in the village, a few euro to park for 4 hours, although if you turn up towards the castle there is closer parking but we were afraid of getting stuck up a narrow lane. We had a 10 minute uphill walk to the castle. We were delighted to",
          "Nice castle to visit. Our kids of 2 and 3 loved just going through the rooms. We didn't go for the audio tour (2\u20ac extra pp) but it was still nice to see the interior and especially the view outside. There can be quite a queue at the entrance to get in. When we arrived the line",
          "Must-see if your a visiting Luxembourg. Beautiful castle. This weekend there was a special medieval event with music and food",
          "The castle building is nice but compared yo nearby Ghent and France, is nothing special. The views over the lush greenery are nice but that's it",
          "A beautiful castle, carefully restored, perched on a rocky hill. A fascinating window to times past with interesting displays and knowledgable (and entertaining) costumed staff. Magnificent photo opportunities. Well worth a visit.",

          "A beautiful castle with amazing views, half of the exhibitions lack descriptions in English though. Still very well worth a visit. We took the lift up, easier than driving/finding a parking spot.",
          "The chateau is a fairytale castle to say the least. Perched on a rocky outcrop in a steep valley the gothic style castle makes its presence known across the town of Vianden. The climb to the castle is steep and daunting. Once there the tour at only a small 7\u20ac begins. The",
          "Long walk up but if you go up slowly its well worth it very good. plenty to see in side 5 euros if in a group 16 or more or 7 euro's if on you own",
          "We were staying in Luxembourg city so this was a bit of a trek to get to but it was worth it. A very impressive chateau on the top of a hill. They have done some great restoration work and you can get round most of it. Further away you can get some great photos of the place.",
          "We were staying in Luxembourg City and had heard about Vianden Castle. It is quite an amazing place considering it had been reduced to a heap of rubble and has been totallyrebuilt and restored. Great information in the castle via the audio tour. It is an additional cost, but",
          "Beautiful castle in Luxembourg. Nice view but it's not easy to walk there...Car park is there...inside 22 rooms.Also easy go by bus.",
          "Excellent experience to learn about the historical facts about Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France. The castle has been fully recovered and you can have access to all the facilities. The plaques are in French and English and there are several multi m\u00eddia interactive pannels.",
          "gorgeous medieval construction , well preserved , and overlooking the lovely little town of Vianden ! Would be a great setting for a movie ...!",
          "The beautiful rooms in the castle and the views make the uphill walk from the town worthwhile. It is quite cheap to visit the castle too. Allow at least an hour for your visit. There is a nice cafe and souvenir shop inside the castle. One tip I will share is do not think about",
          "This town is so quaint and picturesque with the beautiful castle at the top of the hill. We really enjoyed the tour, views and history. I would recommend the audio tour.",
          "I did a daytrip to Luxembourg city from Trier, Germany with the Luxembourg special (which is only 9 Euro go and return) and i definetely do not regret I did it. Even if there are not too many persons who have visited this country, it is absolutely worth, the city is preaty clean",
          "I have begun to like castles more than palaces after seeing this one. The location is really high, so one should be prepared for a steep walk. The castle is not too big, but very well maintained. Theres no rush and we can take a moment to sit and enjoy the view. The staff at",
          "A beautiful castle and village, just a short ride from the city of Luxembourg. The castle's museum is excellent with interesting facts about the local history without being tiring and is also great for children. The route in the Castle is easy to follow without having to wonder",
          "it was a long walk up the hill from hotel , crossing the river and walking through the town .great views when you arrive . I believe it was 8 euros for entry to castle .Just follow the arrows and numbering inside the castle and you can't get lost.",
          "I don\u2019t know what Luxembourg paid to restore this place but they did a great job. This is a beautiful chateau and the audio guide is very good and very educational. The visitor center within the chateau is a great space. The town itself is very cute and worth some time walking",
          "Luxembourg government spared no expense to restore this castle which dates back to the Romans. That what is known, what has been discovered and what is not known is all well covered in the audio guide. Small cafe within sells coffee drinks and desserts, among other things.",
          "I highly recommend going to Vianden, walk around, use funicular... just dont go inside the castle. We went because it was free anyway by the virtue of Luxembourg card. Castle's brochure advises that this, once formidable castle have fallen into state of disrepair and was rebuilt",
          "Vianden castle is amazing. It's very picturesque and is surrounded by great scenery. You can spend a good couple of hours there. There's alot of history to the castle and it's reasonably priced. Plenty to see inside and outside of the castle. Great souvenir shop and coffee shop.",
          "Save your 7 euro, because this castle Has nothing to offer, which you haven't seen before. Unless you buy a audioguide, there is very little information and when we were there many rooms were closed and denied access. So we missed the excellent view over the city which was one",
          "We reached the place by car from Lux City. It was an easy ride. We had to leave the car on a temperary parking because of a bad weather - a lot of rain. We walked to the castle: first down than up the hill. It was steep but not to bad even for not very sporty people like us. The",
          "An easy train trip and bus ride from Luxembourg will take you to the delightful town if Vianden where a shirt stroll up the hill will lead you to the chateau. The display in the Visitor Centre is excellent and well worth your time. It sets a great prelude for your wander through",
          "This is such a great day trip from Lux City. The castle is a beauty, looking out over the lovely village of Vianden. We enjoyed exploring both. The walk up the hill to the castle is not a big deal, and the shops and cafes along the way are worth stopping in for yummy ice cream",
          "Stunning castle that has been beautifully restored. They also have an exhibit showing the restoration which was very interesting too. Remember to get an audio guide as they are very informative but not well advertised. Well worth the \u20ac2.",
          "This is a little gem. The castle has been rebuild and now stands proud looking out over Vianden and the associated area, which is quite a view. Prices are good are standard but the audio guide is superb and at a bargain. The tour takes you through different stages of the",
          "So easy to get to, 50 minutes by train, 25 minutes by bus, the chateaux is way off up high above a beautiful little village, it\u2019s a long way up so get a quick drink before you set off... beautifully renovated, full of historical data and would you believe \u2018heated\u2019 it has a cafe",
          "The history of the Chateau is well interpreted and shares how it changed over time from a Roman fortress to a restoration project. The family history is presented as well. If one is in the area, it is an excellent stop as it shows the \"life cycle of a castle.\" So why the average",
          "It was amazing the view from parking of the castle and the city. Will definitely suggest this place. If you have time take a stroll to the city too",
          "Vianden Castle is worth visiting! The visitors center is incredibly detailed & informative and added to the experience. Having visited a lot of castles previously this one stands out for its grandeur and authenticity (despite being repaired). Well worth it!",
          "We were in 5 countries and 7 cities, and this was the highlight. It was just a stop along the way from Luxembourg City to Cologne, and we went on a whim. We were on our way to Berg Eltz in Germany, but it was closed, so we stopped here. I am so incredibly glad we did. It felt",
          "we stopped here on the way to Luxembourg City. It is worth the extra detour to see this castle and town. We wandered around the castle area and through the town. Very lovely. We actually did not go inside the castle as we didn't have enough time but the time spent walking around",
          "A beautiful castle located in Vianden. It was quite the way to get to here ( 2 buses 1.5hrs) but you need to dedicate a day just for Vianden. The town is small but pretty and the castle itself is remarkable. The castles people center offers a short video of the castles history",
          "Should get audio guide to help understand castle, cute and did half day trip from Luxembourg City. Took 1.5 hours to visit",
          "We didn\u2019t have a ton of time but this can be a quick walk through if you need. Amazing rooms with incredible wood working. They\u2019ve done a great job in the restoration and really shows the magnificence as it sits over the little town of Vianden.",
          "Myself and a friend visited the Chateau on our visit to Luxembourg. It was well worth the visit although takes about 1.5 hours from Luxembourg itself. The bus ran smoothly with 1 change. Cost was \u20ac4 for all day travel. The chateau is \u20ac10 euros in each. This is without a guide.",
          "A stunning setting for a fairy tale castle experience. If arriving by car, park down in the cute town of Vianden and take a lazy stroll up the hill to the castle through the old city. Inside the castle grounds there is a small eatery (expensive, avoid - there are more charming",

          "Getting from the bus stop up the hill is a challenge but the castle is well worth the effort. Fantastic visitor information center, the castle itself was easier than the Porto Nigra in Trier to walk. The restoration is outstanding. We spent 2.5 hours. The gift shop has a",
          "What is so special about this - geography. There are innumerable castles across the globe but you can't go everywhere. So if you are here, haven't seen a lot of them or some outstanding one's already, then visit this castle. Otherwise, there is nothing special (unless you are",

          "Vianden castle was was built between the 11th and 14th century. It is a very large castle sitting above the town of Vianden. It sits just across the border from Germany west of Bitburg and is worth a visit. Cost was not to bad and you can rent a translation device that connects",
          "Going back to 11th and 14th century ago, this magnificent castle was a delightful find during our visit to Luxembourg. A short 45 minutes drive up north from Luxembourg is all it takes to reach this beautiful destination",
          "This is one of the largest fortified castles in Europe, dating back to 10th century. There are nice scenic views from the castle. Parking is not easy. You can park max for 3 hour in the city and 5 hours at the foothills of the castle. The little town of Vianden is worth",
          "Amazing location and beautiful little town. We got train and bus from Lux City - great way to see more of the country. Best to get chairlift up and walk down. Be warned that walk from chairlift station to castle is fairly steep walk downhill through forest. Castle has a great",
          "After a walk up hill, quite a climb for older and/or disabled people, you enter the complex. The chateau is fully restored and looks great. There is a clear route to go thru the chateau, with lots of stairs(!)",
          "Petit chateau, for all kids under 12, alot of heart and joy and activities, music bands with live shows and artistic performers, many shops and 2 dining places. In 2017 was from 29 July until 6 August, and we enjoyed it every day! They have all the details on their website, and",
          "Spent a great couple of hours here exploring and enjoying the entertainment provided. Loved the 'bird man' and music acts, some of the fight scenes very over acted. Would recommend for an afternoon out and to enjoy great views of a beautiful town",
          "Really easy to get to from the city. Train & a bus. The town is beautiful which makes the walk up the hill lovely. We went when the medieval festival is running. Made the trip more enjoyable with a great atmosphere. Who doesn't like swordfighting!",
          "The main point of venturing out of Luxembourg Ville was to see the sights from the top of the hills rather than the castle. The town is very pretty with plenty of bars and restaurants. To get to the top of the hill take the ski lift. Good fun as your legs dangle over the town",
          "Not sure if it's always like that but we got there during the medieval festival week or something like that early in August and there was a lot of side activities, marchants, troubadour, musiciens, shows, food, beer, etc... The only downside is that there was a lot of people!!",
          "We went to Vianden castle for the medieval festival and had an amazing time! The \"telesiege\" on the way up gives you a beautiful view of the town, and there's a lovely walk through the forest back down",
          "Went with my family to see Castle during medieval festival blown away by how well it was organized. My family and I had a great time.",
          "Went here during the week of the medieval festival on the castle. It puts The surroundings in the perfect mood and gives a special feeling of going back in time. Lots of shows and performances to see and enjoy. The kids enjoyed the many games they could play and together with",
          "Well worth the climb to the top of the castle to see around the displays and see about all the history. I was lucky to see the 3 muskateer demonstrations - these are at set times of the day so try and coincide your visit with them at 12.00, 14:30 and 17:00 hours.",
          "Breathe taking, would highly rec commend everyone to do this.. if you take a 5 minuite walk around the corner from here you can get a ski lift which takes you to the top the views at the top are a MUST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
          "The castle has been completely restored and is in excellent condition, both outside and inside. Great views of the city below. we took the audio guide which is a must in our opinion in order to learn more about the history of the castle",
          "Situated on a hill whereby one has to take a ski lift to get there or take a steep and winding road to the top. It is well maintained and has beautiful views from the top looking into the valley. Besides, its ancestry is connected to the Dutch Royals The Orange.",
          "Had an amazing day here recently. No tourists and completely unspoiled. Really easy to get to. We got the train for the centre to Ettelbruck, and then the bus 570 to Vianden. Buses are free in Luxembourg at the weekends. Took under and hour and no crowds at all. Took the cable",
          "Had we known there was an English map or guide or something, we would have purchased it. Pretty much had no idea what we were looking at the whole time we were there. Still pretty to walk around and see though.",
          "What a great place, beautifull old Castle which is related to the Dutch Royalties. You can walk there by your self or use a electronical guide. Just great place, kids can have a nice time of pleasure.",
          "Did the audio tour for this magnificent place. Beautiful scenery, nice little hike to and from the castle. Really enjoyed Luxembourg and this part of the country.",
          "Vianden castle dominates the skyline as you enter Vianden. Perched above the town it looks almost like a fairytale castle. Entry was a very reasonable 7 euros, and this included a leaflet guiding you round a circular tour of the various rooms. The whole castle was restored in",
          "Rebuilt over several years and well worth the 30 minute walk up from the village. Reasonable value, Allow around two hours to visit.",
          "We loved our visit to the Chateau. If you are in the area - Luxembourg, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium - then you should definitely take a look. The way it was built into the rock makes it look like it had magically risen up through the ground! The original part of the castle was",
          "We did the walk through tour at Chateau de Vianden and really enjoyed it. It's amazing walking through halls that have been around for over 800 years. large parts of the castle have been restored, but it's kept its alluring charm. Depending how much you're into medieval history",
          "I seldom buy audio tours but this castle visit is enhanced by one. The history of changes and occupants is made clear by the \"Audio\" and that is critical in view of the castle's complexity. It is a marvelous installation, product of exhaustive renovation efforts and a great",
          "When you arrive Vianden you will encounter with a unique view of castle or both castle and town. From town next to bridge or on tele siege or wonderful pool of Vianden you have a nice view too. Castle was quite and there were some numbers for each section that help visitors",
          "If you do not use the chairlift then the only other option is to walk up through the town which takes about 15-20 minutes depending on your fitness (we had plus 80's who made it ok. Plenty to see in the castle with great views and has a restaurant.",
          "Visited here whilst in Luxembourg!!! Would highly recommend doing this as the little town and the chateau blow Luxembourg city out of the water . The town is the sweetest quaintest town I've ever been to. Immaculately kept . We visited the chateau which is beautifully looked",
          "Stunning setting, lovely chateau. We enjoyed touring the rooms and the special exhibit of bee cartoons.",
          "Sympathetically renovated 40 years ago this visually stunning castle towers over the delightful cobbled village of Vianden. Easy to reach by car or bus, this is absolutely well worth a visit for any travellers to Luxembourg. The steep climb up from the village centre nesting",
          "Our family of 7 were in Trier and decided to visit Luxembourg (since we were so close to the border). We were fascinated with the views from the Vianden castle and the many rooms available inside for viewing. Luxembourg seemed to have better gas prices, too, which we were",
          "We were not lucky, beacuse when we arrived to the castle, it was closed. But the view is very nice, and you can hike as well.",
          "I had an additional day while being in Luxembourg city and Vianden was the best option. It is easily accessible by train/bus and it offers an amazing experience. The chateau itself is well preserved and Vianden is such a beautiful town. Totally worth it!",
          "Have been to several castles in Germany. This was about the same. Cool rooms, history, info. Liked the 'chapel'. Good pics and views. Worth the walk and cost.",
          "We went on a Sunday in may, and it was not really crowded. Entrance was 7 euro per person, which was not much, especially since the tour was really nice. Only the descriptions of the various areas was not translated all the time, so you need to be able to read German. But we",
          "We toured the Chateau on our own. We spent about 1-1.5 hours there... looking at the exhibits and strolling thru the Chateau. A definite stop when in Vianden.",
          "Another trip with our \"Seniors\" Club to this lovely location in the north of Luxembourg. Whilst visiting the town many times it is 30 years or so since we were in the chateau, and the restoration since then is really remarkable. There are numerous exhibits inside that not only",
          "We'd rented a car whilst staying in Luxembourg and decided to spent the day in the small town of Viaden. We walked up to the castle and took a tour around. Although there isn't much to see in the castle due to it being mostly sold off and then rebuilt as recently as the 1970s,",
          "Our kids liked the cableway - it transforms the climb into a descent (the castle is lower than the top of the cableway). The castle is well maintained and definitely worth the visit because of the good views and audio tour. The town is lovely too.",
          "We decided to drive out to Vianden. It was worth the drive - the castle is in good repair, has gorgeous views and is well set out. I was surprised at how much access we had and how much we got to see in the castle!",
          "The castle is situated at the top of a hill. You can park nearby or in the center of Vianden (you have to walk a bit more uphill). The castle is very big and there are many rooms to visit. It is well maintained and very clean. Because of the size of the castle, you can spend",
          "The castle is situated on top of the hill in Vianden. Enough parking space. Steep climb to the entrance. An audio tour is advised, since you will hear a lot more about the castle's history and it will bring the castle more alive. It will cost you only 2 euros extra; it's well",
          "This is a great place to spend a nice afternoon with your family at only 35km from Luxembourg. The Castle is not huge, but the area offers you so much more to do: walk in the forest, hike, house trees and so much more! The village below the castle is really nice as well and",
          "So glad we stopped here and took the opportunity to tour the castle. Dating back to 11-13th century the restoration work was superb. We walked around the castle with awesome views. He first sight of it as you approach from a distance can only be described as jaw dropping.",
          "One of the most beautiful castles i have ever visit. History, culture, architecture. everything was amaizing.",
          "Its a great place, not very suitable for baby stroller though as inside they have lot of stairs. Otherwise it has great view of Luxembourg. Also they have a cafeteria to relax (closes by 5pm). Entrance is chargeable.",
          "Constructed on the foundations of a Roman fortification against Germanic tribes, like so many castles or churches in Luxemburg. One of the largest of its kind in Europe. The audio guide for 2 \u20ac is absolutely necessary as the explanations inside the castle are extremely brief.",
          "This is the highlight of Luxembourg outside the capital city. The castle is heavily reconstructed but it's all the better for that. There's a great circuit which will take about 1h and is very worthwhile. The village at the bottom of the castle is great too.",
          "This castle was in terrible shape due to many parts being sold off in the 19th century. It's been wonderfully restored to its former glory. There is also a very nice snack shop on the property. Lots of walking; gorgeous views of the village below.",
          "I visited it in March and, despite the rainy weather, I liked it. Compared to the one in Esch-sur-Sure, it is more complex from the architecture point of view. It has interesting rooms inside and it offers great views of the region. I discovered unique objects and the old design",
          "I have been to many castles in Europe and this is a very nice one. I did buy the audioguide and recommend that others do too, as there are no signs as to what you're seeing. I did find out through the audioguide that this castle was pretty much torn down to the ground when the",
          "Vianden is beautiful and the 15 minute walk to the castle (up a hill) are definitely worth the effort. To avoid a longer walk make sure you turn right when you see the church on your left hand side and go up a narrow stair that leads to a path to go to the castle. There's also",
          "They have guns, armour, stocks, cannon balls and replica rooms. It's also largely inside which is a tick in the box . All that's missing is a souvenir shop",
          "Having trooped through my share of castles, this castle/tour was quite different than others. The focus was on the archeology and reconstruction of the castle over the years. The interior of the castle is not ornate, but tourists walk through many, many different rooms with",
          "Luxembourg has many castles to visit, Vianden is one of the nicest fortress of the Romanesque and Gothic periods across Europe; completely renoved; magnific for a visit, often there are exhibitions on the knightroom, but also many medieval feasts; you can walk from the old town",
          "If you love adventures you must try this! This little city is nice and lovely you'll enjoy know and see their cultures and castles and history with such a fantastic way. What i mean to this castle you must go from the high and walk through the jungle and don't worry their some",
          "Close to Diekirch, a very nice castle with a small village below. If you like history, plan a visit here",
          "Intension to visit this castle actually brought us to this little town and we totally enjoyed it. I was surprised to learn about rich and sometimes tragic history of this beautiful charming place. The castle is small but in a very good condition (reconstructed) and provides",
          "Very nicely restored castle. It is easy to reach from Luxembourg gare (train + bus, buy a day ticket for \u20ac4) and the entrance fee of \u20ac7 is reasonable. There is a pleasant caf\u00e9 where you can get small pizzas, croque-monsieurs, cakes, coffee, etc. for normal prices. Tip: if you",
          "What can be said about this chateau that has not already been said? Probably nothing but here goes... As we flew into Luxembourg, the air route from England passes right over Vianden and, from the air, it strikes a stunning pose already...so when we pulled into the village on",
          "Enjoyed our afternoon here! Could have gained more if an English guide book was available as very few texts were easy to read with limited French and German. The views were grand all the same and it's beautifully kept. Worth a \u20ac7 entrance fee.",
          "A beautiful old castle that had fallen into disrepair, but has been reconstructed. Still ongoing work. You get a spectacular view of the castle when you come around a corner from behind a hill and see this giant castle looming over you high up on a rock. Inside is still",
          "Masses of Dutch tourists can't be wrong. The completely restored castle with its museum in it is in deed a must do when coming to Luxembourg. Try to go when there's a medieval festival. You will love it. Btw the \"city\" of Vianden is also quite picturesque.",
          "Go -especially with children for a nice visit of a fully restored castle. It is worth seeing and visting while learning about the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg.",
          "The entire village of Vianden was so beautiful and the walk up to the Castle was lovely and the snow added to the enchantment. The history of the caste was very interesting and the audio guide is a must to understand and get an insight into the history and what you are seeing.",
          "Vianden Castle holds very strong position in Luxembourg top 3. It is nicely renovated, partially furnished. Located on the hill overlooking the river and the city. Worth seeing. It also hosts temporary exhibitions- we were lucky to see Rembrandt's drawings so top class art.",
          "I was in Luxembourg for a short weekend with my friend from Friday afternoon to Sunday evening. We decided to go on Saturday afternoon on our full day in Luxembourg. It is around an hour journey altogether single way, train journey to Ettelbruck and bus journey to Vianden. It",
          "We were staying in Luxembourg so decided to get the train/bus to Vianden. It was very easy and straight forward to get to and also cheap. It cost us \u20ac4 for a day ticket on public transport. The bus drops you off at the bottom of Vianden. The walk up to the chateau is very",
          "The castle sits over the town of Vianden and forms a splendid backdrop to the town from most locations. You can drive up to a spot near to the castle to visit, take a steep walk up from town or, I think preferably, catch the chairlift up and walk down to the castle. From the",
          "Great view of the valley with a really feel of ancient Europe. The climb up to castle might be tough for old folfs",
          "Vianden sits at the top of a hill, and is reached by walking through the town. There's no parking at the castle itself, but there are a few small car parks in the town itself. Follow the road up and around and you'll come to the ticket gates, through the castle wall. When we",
          "We went midweek in the off season (October), so the castle itself was fairly quiet but even so, the parking in the town was pretty full. I would suggest using public transport to get to Vianden. It's fairly cheap to get around and free if you buy a Luxembourg Card. The castle is",
          "My husband and I visited on Monday, Jan 2, arriving via Lux city on public transport using the Luxembourg card. Entry to the attraction is also included in the card. I highly recommend getting the supercheap audioguide - only 2EUROS- in particular for English speakers like",
          "This castle is one of the most beautiful attractions in Luxemburg. It is historical and unspoiled, and the view from the top down to the town is breathtaking. Beautiful landscape is like from a fairy tale. In order to get up to the hill one needs to climb relatively lot of",
          "It is remarkable how well this castle has been developed into a museum that you can see how people lived back then. DO NOt miss.",
          "A magnificent castle situated atop a hill in a picturesque small town (in which everything else was closed when we visited). The castle was partly rebuilt, but the most interesting parts - the majority of the interiors - are original. The tour of the whole castle took us about",
          "This appears twice. It is about the only real attraction here other than food and a nice little town. Plan about 2 hours. Parts are heated and parts are outside. This castle is a restored ruin so it is not as involved as some.",
          "The Chateaux is very well kept and unspoiled, preserving the history of the place, the views from the top of Vianden are amazing, and at 6 euros entrance fee well worth it.",
          "Really enjoyed this castle. It's a self guided tour, with a well done tour that you listen to through head phones. I did not do the chair lift to the castle; my friend did and enjoyed the views. Well worth a day trip. As a photographer, it was particularly nice to have",
          "Absolute must visit in Vianden. This beautiful castle gives you a great view and has nice stories to tell. The entrance for entering the castle is 6 euro which is fine. When we were there the ''Knights of the castle'' did a demonstration with weapons including black powder",
          "After having booked 3 rooms at this hotel at a NON-refundable rate, we asked the hotel to cancel our rooms. They immediately accepted and canceled our rooms without any charge.",
          "Our three year old had a great time playing in and touring the castle. I loved the walk up to the castle.excellent views ! It was easy to walk on your own and read the info boards. Take time to walk around the town too !",
          "Absolute pleasure to visit! We first saw the chateau at night gleaming across the water. The hike up to it the next morning did not disappoint. The view was magnificient. It is well maintained with excellent displays including the foundations and the artefacts found there.",
          "This is a perfect place to go with friends or family. The chateau offers a great view and the inside is very well preserved. The surrounding area has a great atmosphere.",
          "We had a fun trip to Vianden castle. It was easy to find from the bus stop, just walk up the street. It is amazing that it got restored, considering 100 years ago it was a ruin. There are great views from the castle, and it is well worth the trip. There are plenty of rooms to",
          "Its a very good city to visit. The Castel is amezing the river is awesome. And road to the is good too.",
          "It was similar to the German castles with which I am quite familiar. Excellent and pretty big castle, I got a great workout out of climbing so many stairs and steep paths, after having eaten a lovely pizza at one of the local restaurants. Lovely castle in a lovely town.",
          "This is a lovely castle in a beautiful, peaceful place. It is situated high up on a hill overlooking Vianden, the river Our and surrounding forest. It has been well maintained and it a good example of a medieval castle with some newer bits added on. The furnishings inside are",

          "For almost 40 years now, the Vianden castle is being rebuilt from mere ruins by a group of people called \"Friends of the Chateau Vianden\" - and they are doing a fine job. There's so much to see inside and out, from ancient weapons and furniture up to traces of the first stages",
          "Lovely to look at although apparently there is not much inside. It sits nestled amongst the trees and is either a steep walk or a trip on a chair lift",
          "Vianden is a very nice small town in the north of Luxembourg. If your driving towards it from the south of the country, the castle seems to suddenly appear out of nowhere. Turn a corner and there it is in front of you, now beautifully restored and once again it dominates the",
          "We spent a good three hours exploring the chateau, using the signed route around the rooms - there is an audio guide as well if required. A pleasant walk up ( there is a chair lift, but it was out of service that day).",
          "The Chateau de Vianden is a beautifully restored castle, the only restored one in Luxembourg. It has a very nice self-guided tour and shows off some of the great finds during the restoration process. It also shows photos of the castle before, during, and after the restoration",
          "To get from the city center to the castle, you will have to take a steep climb. It's not that far, but the climb is steep enough. The climb is well worth, though. The castle itself is interesting and gives a good impression of how things were centuries ago. I was impressed over",
          "Beautiful castle with great views from it. Inside tens of rooms to visit very well preserved. To mention number of movies was made here...",
          "Lovely loooking castle above the town. Didn't have time to go in though. I'm sure if I had it would've been good",
          "Parking is restricted, but this late in the season not too difficult. Short walk to chair lift which takes you across the river and above the Castle. From the top of the chair lift a 400 metre walk steep downhill brought us to the Castle where we refreshed in their cafe used",
          "Still unsure why this gem of a castle is essentially unfinished on the interior but turns out to be a really good time and you can meander around at your leisure.",
          "This castle is fully renovated and painted. Beautiful and certainly worth a visit. We visited in August during the medieval festival. It was very busy but also enjoyable. One of the nicest castles I visited in Europe.",
          "Charming castle high on a hilltop. Not thst much to see but worth a look. Nice cafe next to the castle which sells lovely cold fruit beer.",
          "A stiff walk up the hill to the entrance, but well worth the effort. Guide book in English available at the entrance, and then you follow a prescribed route around the castle. Fairly inexpensive entrance fee. The castle is visually stunning, and inside there is plenty to keep",
          "This Chateau is well preserved and resorted. Maybe it is not the largest one in Europe but for a family with small kids, its size is perfect. One thing we did in advance, is to get some facts on the place from the Internet, and create a small quiz for the kids. It really helped",
          "Wow. This castle was just amazing to visit. Great to see some old weapons, suits from back in the days. The rooms as well with for example the kitchen, bedroom and living room were very impressive. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who goes to Luxemburg.",
          "For me, a senior, the climb was difficult, but worth the effort. We were fortunate to pick a day that the annual festival was being celebrated on Aug. 6th. We learned from the local police that a shuttle bus was running from the edge of town up to the hill to the castle. The",
          "A chateau full of history, take your time and walk around it leisurely. It is a pity that there is no audio guide or it is not working. The ticket entrance staff was not very helpful and did not speak a word more than necessary.",
          "nicely rebuild to the original plans, the tour is interesting and gives wonderful views over the valley and the city below",
          "The castle is gorgeous! It is stunning. The staff are so friendly and kind. Charles, Chris, and Guy were very helpful to me. You can purchase books and get a headset tour of the castle-the audio is in German or French. We had performances at the castle all week. The music",
          "Great day out for the kids. It's has guns, armour, stocks, cannon balls and replica rooms. It's also largely inside which is a tick in the box for the unpredictable Luxembourg climate. All that's missing is a fully stocked gift shop, missed revenue opportunity!",
          "Nice castle to visit. No signage in English. Pay for the audio guide if you want info. A great destination if you are looking for a motorcycle trip.",
          "I hate Renaissance Fairs, and wouldn't it be my luck that they had one happening the weekend we visited! Still, I had a good time and having this kind of fair in an authentic setting was better than if it were in some farmer's fields in the exurbs of Chicago. It was probably",
          "I would not only recommend coming to see the Vianden Castle, but I would recommend this as a wonderful place to stay. The castle is wonderful, not huge but a lot to see. It is not expensive and there is a snack bar and a tavern at the castle. Not much in the way of souvenirs at",
          "A bit dissapointed, expected more. It is quite big with beautiful views. However most rooms are renovated and not in a nice way I think, I like more authenticity. But, worth a visit!",
          "The castle from outside is beautiful, as is the landscape. The inside is alright, but what was really nice, was the medieval festival. They had shows, markets, fencing duels, you could hold a bird (for 2 Euros) and so on... It was a bit expensive though. Otherwise great fun.",
          "We took the option to go up here via the Sky Ride and to walk down back to Vianden village as we were told that the walk up can be quite strenuous. It was a very warm day on the day we went but at least we got some really fabulous views for it and the walk in the woods was so",
          "Vianden was a great day trip from Luxembourg - if you choose to take public transport, you need to take the train from Gare Centrale to Ettelbruck, and then take Bus 570. We didn't use the chairlifts, but instead climbed up to the castle. As a bonus, we visited while the",
          "Great castle and beautiful festival. Nice surprize at the entrance with muschete fire. Nice reenactment of the miedival times. Worth the trip to Vianden. Also the citi is beautiful and worth some time spent.",
          "Very nice castle. Lovely landscape and interesting exhibitions inside. Vianden town with their charming streets and restaurants show you Luxembourgian culture well worth it",
          "The village and castle are both stunning, when we visited there was also a mediaeval fair in the castle and music festival in the village. The castle has been reconstructed in the style of the 1600s and is accessible by road, footpath and chairlift. The re-enactors there for",

          "Great day out visiting this reconstructed medieval castle! The village it's based in is also stunning! Highly recommend!",

          "Great castle to visit if you are in the neighborhood! Great to see that castle has been build on old roman foundations. We recommend to take the audio tour, which can give you information in your own language. Be aware all other info is in German and French",
          "Lovely castle in a lovely town. Go up on the chair lift for an impressive entrance. There is a lovely cheap restaurant at the top of the chairlift.",
          "The castle's location is great, on top of a rock with mountains all around it to admire it. But then you enter it: everywhere you see glass doors, staircases in different styles, wiring that you see running through walls and tiles from a 1980s spa. The chapel is appalling with",
          "I recommend you combine the visit with a trip on the chairlift. At the top of the chairlift is a great view of the castle. You will then need to take an approximate half mile walk down via a track through a wood. This requires a reasonable level of fitness. It's hard to imagine",
          "This little jewel in the middle of nowhere is beautiful. People are very friendly and willing to help. Although the town is quite small, the castle makes it worth seeing.",
          "With displays of armor and weaponry over the centuries and rich tapestries, you very much get the vibe of the history of the place. A weapon demonstration by folk in historical dress was very entertaining and included firing of an arquebus and a musket rifle (very loud).",
          "I would definitely get the audio guide if you are English speaking as I don't remember any of the wiring being in English - at 2 euros for the guide, 6 euros entrance for adults and 5 euros for pensioners I thought it was great value. We had coffee and cake in the coffee shop",
          "Very nice place to visit in Vianden. 6 euro entrance which is fine. Whem we were there the knights of the castle did a demonstration with weapons inclusing shooting some black powder. Really cool! Too bad that the best views from the castle are not allowed to go..",
          "Nicely renovated chateau with clear routing to explore the place. We were there on Thursday early afternoon, not crowded at all. Recommended for families.",
          "We took the 2-seated chairlift up and had a lovely 10 minute walk down to the castle (wouldnt recommend doing this in the rain as this will be a slippery road through the woods) Castle is renovated and brought back to its original state, however renovations are still ongoing.",
          "This castle has been pretty much completely restored in recent years, which makes it seem a little less intriguing. But the views of Vianden are worth the modest entrance price alone (4-5 Euro if I remember correctly). Also beware most of the signage isn't in English (mainly",
          "n general, Luxembourg appears to be a completely underestimated tourist attraction and that includes the castle of Vianden. The locals did a marvelous job in reconstructing this history jewel! Enjoy taking in all the views from the nice little town up to the castle and then down",
          "Looking at this castle coming from the street, the view is really suggestive. It let u think about how awesome it could be visiting inside the rooms. This thought is rejected since the beginning of the tour...inside it is completely restructured by modern type and the rest of",
          "Interesting medieval findings, it worth the visit. From the Hot Stone Restaurant take the chairlift which takes you to a place where you can follow a path into the forest leading to the castle's entrance.",
          "Amazing castle right on top if the clift with a wonderful view on the valley below. Even though it has been rebuilt from the ground up, it is still a trip back in time. You will learn about the history of the Vianden's area, of the ruling family and of Luxemburg itself. Take",
          "Chateau de Vianden is an amazing place to visit, all the more so because it was in ruins until the Grand Duke of Luxembourg transferred it to State ownership in 1977. Since then, it has been lovingly restored to its former glory, though work is still going on. It isn\u2019t very",
          "Interestingly this castle was build and rebuild. After the Dutch King bought it, it was sold brick by brick. They did an amazing job to rebuild it in it's original state. The view from the different rooms is amazing. Just make sure you wear your walking boots. Walking from the",
          "Castle's location is very picturesque. I recommend to take the tour as the castle is really beautiful, one of the best in this part of Europe.",
          "Are castles boring to visit? Or only when they are not more than some ruins? This is a question I ask myself frequently when castle stories are about hundreds, sometimes even thousand years ago. About people you never heard about, you are not interested in, etc. Maybe for",
          "To start, the drive to the castle from Ramstein was GREAT. I'm glad I left early because I ended up making 7 stops to see other sights. Make sure you bring a camera. The inside of the castle has lots of art and artifacts to view. Plan to spend at least an hour inside, then walk",
          "It's nice that you can tour at your own pace and just sort of look around, but in may of the rooms there was nothing to see. Some rooms had furnishings, but many did not.",
          "Beautiful castle definitelly worth a visit. Most of the rooms are empty. The forniture I have seem looks like mismatched left overs. One can easily tell there is still a lot to be done. I hope they receive enough resorces to continue the good work done so far.",
          "This beautiful and well preserved castle is a must see in Luxembourg. Wander around, take you time, enjoy the castle and the surrounding.",
          "Lovely almost finished castle. 2 minute walk from the parking to the castle. Nice vieuws and to my opninion the most beautifull castle in the area",
          "This Chateau (not a castle because only duke and not king lived here) was a gem to find and tour. Reasonably priced and audio guided tour is self paced and well worth it. There are lots of stairs and a rather steep climb to the gate, so be prepared. We noticed several seniors",
          "We enjoyed visiting this castle, it really is beautiful. The surrounding town is lovely as well. You will have to pay for parking with coins, so make sure you have some.",
          "As you approach Vianden and this magnificent caste approaches you ge tthe feeling that it is taken from a fairytale. Even though I didn't visit the castle itself I surely enjoyed it from a distance.",
          "This site is about an hour's drive from Luxembourg city, and is well worth the visit. It's not too expensive to get in, and get an audio guide, which is quite informative (+/- EUR 8 pp). It has some really amazing views from the top of the castle. The town of Vianden itself is",
          "A beautiful castle sat on top of a hill! Take the cable car up to the top of the hill, stop for a quick coffee and take the short walk down to the castle. It's worth a visit which should take up a good few hours. Worth getting an audio tour if you want to know it's history.",
          "Vianden Castle is fabulous. It cost \u20ac14 for two adults and audio guide which is a very good price for a few hours of interesting historic information. The castle was built between 11th & 14th century. It went into disrepair and now a National Treasure which has been restored",
          "This is a very large and impressive feudal residence which was built in the Romanesque and Gothic Periods. It located high up on a rocky hill, it dates back to around the 10th century. Very impressive place.",
          "A great afternoon well spent. Stopped on our way to the Chateau in the countryside for a picnic lunch then went to the Chateau. I would recommend this site. It was well done, and fascinating to see what people lived in way back then. Make sure to visit the town, its very",
          "Visited with a big group. Bus managed to drop us close to the entrance. You get a audio player as guide so you can skip the boring parts. Awesome looking medieval castle with everything that comes with it. Must visit when in Luxemburg",
          "For 6E for adults and 2E for children, you'll get a great self-guided tour of this impressive castle. It's been added to over the ages and the recent renovation makes for a pleasant and informative visit. There's plenty of the inside to visit if the weather is bad and there's",
          "The landscape of the castle is simply amazing. One of the most beautiful I have ever visited. There are lots of nice restaurant nearby. My especial recommendation goes to the one you can prove the best grilled meat inside Luxembourg (Albergie Aal Veinen) Other thing you can",
          "Stumbled on this place. It was pretty cool. The food was great and so was the service. Even for americans....",
          "We visited the castle upon a day trip from Luxembourg. And it was worth it! If we arrive by car you should know the parking spaces are rather few. We were lucky enough to find one 800m away from the castle. The castle is quite big and well maintained, it reminded me of another",
          "Great town, great view of the castle, amazing nature, great chairlift ride, but average castle. Most of the doors and windows were inaccessible so we didn't get the proper view. You have to pay extra for the audio guide. We liked Bourscheid better.",
          "Would highly recommend the Vianden Castle. The views from top of castle are amazing! Excellent value for money (costing 6 euros each adult) A very nice cafe there.",
          "It's a fairytale no matter what the weather but I've visited it several times and nothing beats climbing in the mist and the sun burning the mist away to expose the beautiful countryside. Luxembourg is stunning and Vianden is a key attraction.",
          "Castle looks impressive from far and for the ticket price, it is a worth-visiting attraction in Vianden. However, the views from the top of the castle is quite average (probably because it was a rainy day when we went up the castle). Be careful of slippery floors too.",
          "The tapestry's were worth seeing on there own, the chateau is amazing a walk back in history in a different country. The views have to be seen.",
          "Entry cost just 5 euros (Senior rate) which compares very favourably with 'rip-off Britain' prices. The small caf\u00e9 also excellent value; usually these can be expensive for a captive clientele; not this one. Food prompt and excellent value. The Chateau has been superbly restored",
          "Vianden Castle is a very beautiful castle set on the hilltop, overlooking the town. The area is surrounded by Ardenne forest, and one would find it quite tranquil. There is a splendid chairlift that takes you to the top of where you can enjoy delicious treats. This is the 2nd",
          "Fun bit of history to explore. Self-guided tour allows you to pace yourself. Great views of the town below. Allow 2 hours for full exploration.",
          "Really good place to gather information about history and also good view to village. Only bad thing was all signs in museum was not in English, so guided tour will be more informational for you.",
          "We were at vacation in Vianden and of course we had to visit this castle. This was a great experience. A very well composed round in- and outside. We had a very pleasent walk through the castle and it's history. We highly recomment a visit.",
          "We took our 18 month old, so our visit was a bit of a whirlwind! Such a beautiful castle with so much character. I can't wait to go back and really explore it!",
          "This is a castle in a very good condition. If you are around, do not miss it, Vianden is a quaint small town, so you'll like that too. The castle has interesting exhibits, shown in a modern way. It's worth a weekend visit.",
          "We went with small kids, they also enjoyed it , the view is breathtaking, the castle is well preserved and very big, to enter it you must pay",
          "This castle is what I imagined reading about knights as a kid. The inside has been redone and is one of the few castles that is worth walking through. It is also in a picturesque town.",
          "The castle is in good shape, thanks to the restorative efforts of the local government. There is a guided tour with optional audio available. The entry cost is pretty cheap too (EUR 6 per adult). Children under 12 go free. There are historical artifacts on display within the",
          "We took a bus to Vianden specifically to visit the Chateau. The surrounding area has some amazing views and the castle is a must see - and also gives great views over the town. So glad we took this trip, a must see if you come to Luxembourg.",
          "This was recommended to me before we came to Lux' and we were very glad for the tip. I've seen a few castles in my time, but this one is very well done indeed. Kudos to the restoration team. This is a terrific spot to see how Roman forts once morphed into bigger things,",
          "I came here during the Easter break, it was well worth the visit. The castle has been carefully restored and has some excellent exhibits. There were some wonderful views of the surrounding area, especially looking down on the little town of Vianden.",
          "The castle has been restored and worth the trip. The view overlooking the town is breathtaking. Nice exhibits, interesting rooms and furniture.",
          "We have visited this place multiple times over the years. Absolutely love this castle. Definitely worth visiting. This is one of my favorite castles. I think I have seen it in every season. My family and I enjoy the displays inside along with great areas to take pictures.",
          "Visited the castle last week and thoroughly enjoyed it. Very picturesque views all around. Great attraction and a must visit if you're in the area.",
          "We took the train and bus from Luxembourg city for just \u20ac4 return to vianden and what a lovely day we spent here! It is such a beautiful place and the castle is the cherry on the cake! We visited in March and it was lovely and quiet and very peaceful! A very good price at being",
          "We were staying in Luxembourg city and it took a few buses and a train to get to Vianden. Since transport is extremely cheap it was worth going on the trip and being able to see some other places on the way. There is a bit of a steep hill from where the bus stop in Vianden to",
          "Vianden Castle dominates the landscape above the village of Vianden, looking majestic by day or, beautifully illuminated, by night. You can do a tour of the inside of the castle; you pay for entry and can then buy a written guide or an audio-guide; the overall cost is",
          "This big and beautiful castle \"taken\" from fairy tales is the main attraction of the small and picturesque town of Vianden. It is located on the top of the hill above the town and dominates the landscape. Beautiful architecture, big and many spaces, nice views of the town and",
          "Easy ride on the 570 bus from Ettelbruck. Nice walk along cobbled roads through an old village up to the castle. Cheap entry at 6 euros. Excellent views. Large area inside castle open to explore.",
          "This is well worth a visit. It's so beautiful! We had a rental car and drove from Luxembourg city which took about 40minutes. Parking was not a problem- it was a Sunday so I don't know if this makes a difference. It cost \u20ac6 for entry to the castle or \u20ac4.50 for a student. It's",
          "I stayed a long weekend in Luxembourg and visited the castle on my way back to the Netherlands. Parking can be a bit challenging so good luck if you find one. The castle itself is worth to see but I know by chance that there are also some hiking trails that you can plan for a",
          "We travelled from Luxembourg city with the Luxembourg card, and it was all very convenient. We were there when it just opened so it was great to have the place to ourselves. The route was clear and there were informative display cards all around to explain the history of the",
          "We stayed in the town for 2 nights mainly to see this castle and it did not disappoint! It was a little difficult to find and it is an uphill walk to get there but the views were stunning and the castle itself was extremely interesting! The cafe was lovely too and not",
          "Lovely Castle well worth visiting if you are in Vianden. Lots of history. Rooms well furnished. Museum. Cafe. Concerts on certain days too!",
          "This castle is SELF-LEAD tour which is awesome! You're not rushed through any rooms and you can take your time. The castle is huge. It's absolutely gorgeous. We spent three hours milling about looking at every room and every floor. For English speakers, there are some",
          "In my recent visit to Luxembourg I was recommended by friends that I should use my limited time to visit Vianden Castle.The journey via Ettelbruck to Vianden was by bus. Nice roads, beautiful landscapes dotted with farms, cows grazing, river views, autumn colours. Everything was",
          "It is nice place to visit but it should be in summer so you can use the cable car because we found it close there is a cafe inside to rest",
          "True medieval castle with great view. Restored in last century and we should thank Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for that. Picturesque road and good access to. Real pleasure!",
          "We visited on a themed day so there was music, crafts, dancing and lots of activities (as well as lots of people). The building was interesting and well maintained. We only spent about an hour there, but if I were to go back to Vianden I would visit again and I'd recommend to",
          "A beautiful castle to visit giving you all the history over the centuries, the occupants and its famous visitors. Beautiful views from the castle",
          "We took the train and bus from Luxembourg to Vianden, very easy to get there. Cost of 4 \u20ac for return journey , so cheap. Arriving at the village you see the castle perched high on the rocky hill, it stops you in your tracks and makes you go wow! The walk up is relatively steep",
          "The Chateu de Vianden, is a perfect place to visit if you are romantic and in love with history. If I were to marry again, I would find a way to marry there (I'm not sure if it is possible...) or spend the honeymoon somewhere very nearby. It is so BEAUTIFUL! One should go there",
          "Parking just down the street from the castle with about a 5 minute walk to the entrance. Very picturesque castle sitting up above the village. For about 6 euros an adult you can tour the castle on your own. For 2 euros you can get an audioguide. The audio guide goes room by",
          "We walked up to the Castle from the Victor Hugo Hotel. This amazing castle boasts a varied history of royalty, celebrity and locals throughout time making sure their opinion is heard... as they nicked the rocks from the castle to build their own houses! Chateau de Vianden",
          "We flew in from Asia and spent 6 days in Luxembourg for business. We found that quite a number of attractions have closed for the late autumn and winter. Getting a family Lux card and travelling to Vianden by bus on Sunday was definitely a good idea to see what else the country",
          "Not very expensive and surely worth a visit. shows the reconstruction of the medieval castle after having been left to deteriorate many years. income is 6\u20ac for adults. You can rent a radio guide phone to have more explanations.",
          "This castle gives the visitor the opportunity to have a look into the past. Walking around this castle required some exercise thow.",
          "When you get down at the Breck best stop, you see the castle right on top of you on a very high hill. We were wondering, how difficult it is going to be walking up (especially with a kid of 2 years old). The path up is very steep and takes around 10-15 minutes\u2019 walk. Walking",
          "I stayed in Luxembourg for a couple of days and quickly ran out of sights to see. At the recommendation on my hotel receptionist I took a day trip to Vianden (only \u20ac4 return!) to see the castle. It's an old feudal castle that was refurbished in the 70s and they've done an",
          "In a beautiful area out of the capital of Luxembourg, in a graphical and quiet place in Vianden is built this incredible Castle.. It is up in a small hill, with great decoration and breathtaking view... I am very glad for having the opportunity to visit it.",
          "We did a day trip here in November. A lot of Vianden was closed but the main attraction wasn't. A steep incline to the castle but worth every step when you get there. The views are spectacular. Definitely take time to make a visit here. There is a lovely bakery in the",
          "Try to see the view from outside the city. Nice way to start out by seeing this view then going to the castle. The castle has recently been reopened and overall they did a nice job displaying photos, artifacts and rooms filled with period furniture, etc. My 2nd time here and",
          "This is a beautiful castle, inside and out, situated in a great location. You could tour the whole site in an hour easily. There are many rooms, my favorite being the kitchen with ladies cleaning vegetables in period dress. There were a few other people in period costume doing",
          "We visited the castle with our Luxembourg Card. If you want to learn more about the history and all aspect of the castle, may rent a guide tour device. It is a spot that worth a visit. We came not in a peak season, hence not crowded and can walk around the castle in our relaxing",
          "This was the largest Castle we visited while in Luxembourg. It was very well maintained. It wasn't just a simple castle tour though, they had historic things like suits of armor, weapons, and such. It was very interesting. I enjoyed seeing the models of the castle being restored",
          "The Chateau de Vianden can easily be reached from Luxembourg by train. From the train station, we still have to walk uphill. Quite exhausting, but on the way, you can see small houses that grew colorful flowers (we went there in spring).",
          "The castle of Vianden in North-Eastern Luxemburg is one of the most fantastic castles that I have ever visited (and since I love Castles, I have visited quite many of them). Situated on a high rock just above the city of Vianden and a river below the views from the castle are",
          "Very fascinating and interesting place to visit. I highly recommend spending a few hours exploring this castle and the views of Vianden. Make sure to walk up the winding road opposite from the castle to get some pictures of the entire castle sitting high up on the hill.",
          "Beautiful setting. Impressive castle overlooking the town. Recommend to take the audio tour....it describes the history and the use of the particular rooms. If not, you'll be wandering around aimlessly and uninformed. If you are a couple, ticket booth advised us that we could",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to the castle. This lovingly restored chateau is beautiful inside and out with spectacular views to the village and beyond. A bit of a walk uphill, but it's well worth it. You're given a guide to the rooms which was helpful indeed. More extensive",
          "We really enjoyed visiting the Chateau in Vianden. The castle is beautiful, with lovely views from every window. We didn't use the audio guide and it took us about 40 minutes to tour all through the castle.",
          "...and I've seen most of them by now. I took my cousins and friends visiting there, all delighted. Castle is really impressive, on the hill, beautifully lightened at night. A bit crowded over the weekend but not surprising. Vianden village is my favourite in Luxembourg,",
          "An excelent visit, if not a bit expensive; \u20ac6 to go inside. However it is well maintained - Well worth a visit!",
          "Quite a walk uphill, but still worth it! Big and beautiful castle with so many rooms and quite an intuitive guide that naturally leads you through the castle! For your time estimations: 1 hour was enough for us to see the castle. There is a lovely cat freely walking on the",
          "I would not drive hours out of my way to see this castle, but if you are in the general vicinity, it is worth a visit. You must get the audioguide to get an understanding of the castle. The tour was nicely done; very little is furnished but the architecture and views are",
          "The chateau has all the features of a well preserved fortress. We enjoyed walking through the chateau but more so relished the views from it.",
          "The castle restoration occurred in 1978-1987 and it is well done as far as the went. Given the long history of the counts of Vianden and their relation to the current ruling house I expected more authentic furnishings and more complete displays. Worth a visit as the castle",
          "The chateau has a long history and has been subject to much restoration making it an interesting place to visit. For English speakers all of the descriptions are in several languages including English so you can easily understand the meanings of the exhibits. Disabled visitors",
          "Interesting visit to the history of Luxembourg. the castle is well preserved, the visit plan is well organized a magnific work done for the reconstruction of the castle and the views are top!",
          "Get the pass that allows you to do the hop on and hop off tour, the chairlift to the top overlooking the castle, and the castle tour, among museum passes, it's as much as the admission for the castle only and very worth it! You can buy the pass at the castle for about 26 euro",
          "Very nice castle with a great history linked to the royal families of Oranje and Nassau. Is part of the family tree of Oranje-Nassau. Really recommended to visit it as the reconstruction of the castle is a great success",
          "We spent a very pleasant couple of hours here. There are around 20 different rooms to walk through, each giving information on the castle and its inhabitants over the years. Not all the info is available in English, but my school boy French got me the gist... Lots of steps, but",
          "The Castle over looks the town and its only a few mins from the German border. We visited the castle on a Saturday afternoon, we were lucky to find a park right near the entrance. The Castle has been restored to a good standard great views looking from the castle over the town.",
          "The restoration of the late 1970s to 1980s has been fantastic. However very little of the narrative/descriptions are in English so you definitely need the audio guide. Views are also amazing. The walk from the town centre is worth it, but you can also park at the gates.",
          "This is well worth a visit. Apart from the occasional bit of concrete, which is not exactly a traditional material, it has been restored beautifully.",
          "The castle has been fully restaurated and is nice to take a visit. There even is a dutch audio tour which we didn't take. To pitty dogs are not allowed.",
          "Impressive castle in a magnificent sceneray. The nearby village is also very picturesque and definitely worth a visit. There is also a lift which we did not use, because we did not have the time, but it should offer a thrilling experience",
          "Vianden Castle is one of the largest fortified medieval castles so wonderfully cared for. About 300 meters tall on top of a rocky pointed mountain area. Victor Hugo was a huge fan. You can visit by car and park at the bottom entrance. The castle is best visited at night but",
          "We were quite impressed with this castle which has been restaurated to appear as it did in the late 1400s. There are lots of rooms and hallways to see and explore. An audio guide is offered however we opted out. The views from the castle are also quite spectacular. Tip: when",
          "Fun to take the cablecar up and walk in 10 minutes to the castle. From the outside the castle looks fabulous but we were not impressed by the inside. It did not match with the outside somehow and the furniture did not look as if it belonged there.",
          "Didn't know much about Vianden before visiting while staying in Vielsalm. Vianden is a lovely place to spend a day. Walk down the main street and have a coffee, take the chairlift up to the chateau, and if you have children with you have a game of mini-golf. The chateau is",
          "Great castle which has been rebuilt to show how it was originally as it was only ruins before. Very steep hill from the parking place and up and then there are many stairs in the castle itself. A great place to stop on the way to Germany and the town is lovely.",
          "its really worth to visit! the surrounding of the castle is a beautiful hilly countryside with forest and a small river...the castle is well maintained and you get a nice insight of how living must have been in the medieval ages...",
          "Beautiful restored castle, the biggest in Europe in such good shape. Very genuine on the outside, a little modern on the inside, but still a good impression of what it was like. Don't take the chairlift, as it is a steep climb down, just walk up from the town",
          "Pros: 1- free with Luxembourg card 2- well preserved and presented castle from Medieval era 3- useful and fully informative audio guide Cons: 1- the audio guide costs 2\u20ac even with Luxembourg card 2- takes 15 min hiking to reach to it if you use lift. I guess it takes longer if",
          "We love Chateau de Vianden and the medieval style village that it is set in. You can self tour the castle at your own pace, plan on at least 45 mins to an hour. Parking is just down the hill, about a 3 min walk to the entrance. Great english booklet available for \u20ac3 at the cash",
          "Looking up towards the castle from below, you can only but imagine how life must have been hundreds of years ago with this fortress protecting the town of Vianden below. It towers boldly over the quaint town and has a great air of majesty about it. The audio tour is only a few",
          "We decided to visit this castle as we were in the neighborhood. Good half day visit. Quiet and spacious. Good for walking around and learning a little about the country's past.",
          "We arrived to Vianden to spend calm weekend in nature. Small town is sweet and offers you view on the castle almost from every point. We decided to go there by lift and it was good choice. Thanks to that you can see castle from the top, after short walk through forrest you get",
          "The castle is definitely worth a visit. Last entry is at 6pm. We arrived at 5.:45pm and were not rushed out.",
          "The castle itself is not that special, I have seen better ones here in Europe. But the walk up to the castle is very nice and offers a great view of the small town below, especially on a sunny day.",
          "Very big Castle with nice medieval look, Indeed transports you to another era. TThey claim is the biggest , I am not sure about that but it is nice",
          "The village and castle of Vianden are not to be missed on a visit to Luxembourg. The chateau is impossibly charismatic, exonerating the Luxembourg government's decision to completely rebuild it, starting around 40 years ago. The castle provides an authentic insight into",
          "1 hour away from Luxembourg City Chateau de Vianden is a nice half day trip. Town of Vianden is picturesque and touristy with many restaurants and river walk. Castle was restored well so it's a pleasure walk wondering around its grounds.",
          "For about an hour drive from Luxembourg, worth the visit because of the location and the history itself. The castle was restored quite well to give that amazing look.",
          "1 hour if you get the train to ettelbruck and the 520 bus I think it is..from gare central in Luxembourg city. Picturesque and touristy town. If possible,take the ski lift down from the castle as the views are outstanding.",
          "You will need around 1 hour from Luxembourg city centre to go to Vianden. It is 4 euros for a day ticket (all trains and buses included) and 6 euros to enter the castle.if you want you will need extra 2 euros for the audio guide(we didnt pay for that). A very well renovated",
          "I love hiking through Vianden. The hiking trails invariably go up and above the chateau with lovely views of the exterior. Did a tour inside many years ago. Rather blah. But, from above and across the valley, the views of the chateau are amazing.",
          "Its well away from luxembourg city. The Castle was amazing and offered stunning views around it. The trip will take more than half a day.",
          "You'd better go there via a chairlift (beautiful ride!!!), and then walk down to the castle from the upper chairlift station through pleasant forest. Then, after the castle, go back to town via main street walking downhill. It is much more convenient this way.",
          "For 6 euro's a nice visit for a beautiful Chateau. Only thing was that you didn't had a nice panorama view over the city at the castle. But when you walk down a little bit, there is a panorama view behind a tower.",
          "Travelling to Luxembourg do not miss the only 1 hour away charmy castle build during centuries - in this castle is written the great par of European history. At the castle the John Boheme (known as John Luxembourg, Czech king) was born and his son maybe built world known castle",
          "Definitely worth it! Such an amazing experience! It's about 40 minutes from Luxembourg city, we stopped on our way in. We spent 2 weeks in Europe - Paris, Brussels, Brouges, Cologne and Champagne. This was by far my favourite thing we did on our trip! Definitely get the audio",
          "6 euros and a couple extra for an audio guide gets you a great tour of this fantastic Chateau. Despite initial looks it has been recently rebuilt from a ruin. Well done Luxembourg.",
          "Great renovated castle!! Not heavily visited on Tuesday June 2. Cheap tour at 6\u20ac pp. We also got the 2\u20ac Audio guide (one per family is all u need) and it was well worth the money! Educational with historical facts rather that a fairy tale story. We really enjoyed this castle.",
          "Although it might sound a bit complicated at first, it\u00b4s pretty straight forward going to Vianden castle from Luxembourg City. In terms of time, it\u00b4ll take you around 1 hour to get there; in terms of money, it\u00b4ll cost you 4 euros for a day ticket (trains and buses included) and",
          "We took the chair lift up the hill and walked down to the chateau. Be sure to purchase the audio guide for the tour. It was very interesting. Great renovation with an interesting history.Enjoy.",
          "The castle is located in Vianden - a small, picturesque town which is worth a visit as much as the castle itself. We took the train from Lux city to Ettelbruck and from there bus 570 which stops opposite the station. The journey took less than an hour and was very easy with good",
          "One of the largest fortified castles west of the Rhine, fully restored from ruins and well preserved. It is worth visiting the castle museum (audio guides offered in different languages (Russian included). Nice views from the castle walls (terrases).",

          "Spent a great few hours exploring the castle, the audio guide is a definite, giving context and background to the history of the castle. I was there with friends with children who thoroughly enjoyed their adventure around the castle. Stunning views.",
          "Lovely place, lovely vistas (probably even better than any in Luxemburg city) and a laid back town, it's worth the drive.",
          "The castle is located high above the picturesque town of Vianden. I believe you can drive your car up to it, however we took the ski lift from the village to the top of the mountain....which was cool, until we realized there was a good long trek down the mountain to actually",
          "Chateau de Vianden is a lovely castle. The restoration is excellent, and the views of the surrounding area is lovely. When I went, there was an exhibition for satirical comics and images, a nice extra. Tip: Comfortable walking shoes a must - the way up is hilly (but not that",
          "This is a beautiful castle in a beautiful city and region. Please make sure you also get the audio guide for 2 Euros extra - it is well worth it! The Vianden Castle was constructed between the 11th and 14th centuries on the foundations of a Roman 'castellum' and a Carolingian",
          "I stayed with friends in Vianden and obviously we had to visit the castle, you see it from every part of town. It opens at 10 AM and as a student we paid \u20ac4,50 per person (normal entrance fee is \u20ac6,00). We followed the route and saw some interesting parts like the pedigree part",
          "Such a scenic castle and such a nice walk to it. There was a Picasso exhibition which was nice, went during the quiet season so had time to walk around and take many pictures",
          "We first took the Chairlift and then we walked to the castle for a short visit. Really impressive a worth a visit ...",
          "This is a castle that you imagined when you were a child. Set furthermore in a stunning setting on a hill. Really worth a visit. Prepare for quite some steep walks and stairs. But clearly worth the effort.",
          "Whether standing anywhere in the scenic little village of Vianden staring up at this beautiful castle or actually touring the grounds and inner corridors, Chateau de Vianden is a real treat. This well maintained site is a pleasure to behold and a reasonable entry fee will allow",
          "This castle is located in a beautiful valley, just outside Luxembourg City. We walked from the bottom of the hill, took us 20 minutes, best also buy the audio guide in English, a truly great castle to visit",
          "It is located in a beautiful valley and the drive alone towards the castle from the city was a feast to the eyes. I had only 5-6 hours in Luxembourg and instead of city tours, I visited the castle. I am so glad that I decided to do that- thanks to my friends.",
          "This castle is really cool. Try to visit it in the morning while it's not crowded, and you will get the medieval feeling right after you open the castle's door. Hear the echo of your own footsteps inside the castle, it feels majestic! The museum is well designed so you won't",
          "My adult daughter and I visited Vianden and really enjoyed learning about the history and architecture. It's a really cool medieval castle. I was so glad we spent the extra 2 euro for the audio tour headset. Without it, you'd miss a lot of interesting information. We also had a",
          "Liked the freedom of movement and historical scripts throughout the castle. Family lineage neat as well. Historical arms cool.",
          "This is a fantastic castle perched magnificently on a hill looking down to vianden and the surrounding areas. With reasonable prices to enter the castle offers the visitor a unique and interesting insight into the history of the castle and its exhibitions with a blend of old and",
          "When staying in Luxembourg City, Vianden is an ideal destination for a day out in pleasant surroundings. A frequent rail service connects the city with Ettelbruck, a journey of some 40 minutes. Just outside the station cafeteria, take the 570 bus for a further 25 minute leg to",
          "Well worth a visit to this imposing castle with great views over the town and valley below. A nice blend of old castle walls with more recent chateau, there was an exhibition of about 100 picasso drawings on show in one of the rooms during my visit",
          "It's a magnificant palace in a magnificant place, very well preserved. From here you could also chose the \"Victor Huho Path\". Nice trekking!!!",
          "A nice chateau, well preserved and exploited, with an excellent view to the village and the river bellow it. Make sure not to go earlier than 12:00 in the winter, because it always has thick fog and you'll miss the view.",
          "its worthy to visit this castle....brings vivid idea life was back then.... I could go and go and go again and again and again..... nice view from the castle to the vilagge toooooo",
          "This is one of the most impressive places I've ever been. The castle is imponent itself in the high of a dover. Really worth it to go all the way up to reach the bottom of the building. If you go a little further you will have a pretty view of the city. Getting in the city is",
          "The way to do the chateau is to take the chairlift up and the footpath down. It's very well kept and very interesting. The coffee shop was being refurbished while we were there. The staff were pleasant in a perfunctory sort of way.",
          "It's one of the most amazing castles I've ever seen, situated in really charming town. The veiw for the castle is much more interesting than the interiors, but still it was amazing to visit it.",
          "Very easy to get there from Luxembourg City for a day trip. Trains go every 20 minutes and then there is a bus- whole trip is about an hour with pleasant scenery along the way. There is an up-hill walk to the castle, but not too strenuous and can be broken up with visits to",
          "Visited the place with my three year old son. The castle is fairly small and nice. The entire place can be explored in about an hour. The audio guide was good, would have been a challenge without it as there are no information boards in English inside the castle.",
          "Nothing special. Really poor doesn't compare to any of the other castles in the region. Actually seeing the castle from the outside while you are in Vianden makes it very tempting to go inside and discover but once you enter you immediately feel how poor it is and regret",
          "Well worth the visit if you find yourself in the area and a good day trip if you are within driving distance. Definitely one of Luxembourg's more impressive attractions outside of the capital itself.",
          "Sitting high on the the hill above Vianden, this chateau's best photographic view is across the valley while approaching the town. There is pay and display parking available above town, but downhill from the chateau about a 5 minute walk uphill to the entrance (fee is \u20ac6). There"

        "wiki": "Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: L\u00ebtzebuerg, French: Luxembourg, German: Luxemburg), also known as Luxembourg City (Luxembourgish: Stad L\u00ebtzebuerg or d'Stad, French: Ville de Luxembourg, German: Stadt Luxemburg, Luxemburg-Stadt), is the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the country's most populous commune. Standing at the confluence of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers in southern Luxembourg, the city lies at the heart of Western Europe, situated 213 km (132 mi) by road from Brussels, 372 km (231 mi) from Paris, and 209 km (130 mi) from Cologne. The city contains Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.\nAs of 31 December 2019, Luxembourg City has a population of 122,273 inhabitants, which is more than three times the population of the country's second most populous commune (Esch-sur-Alzette). The city's population consists of 160 nationalities. Foreigners represent 70% of the city's population, while Luxembourgers represent 30% of the population, and the number of foreign-born residents in the city rises steadily each year.In 2011, Luxembourg was ranked as having the second-highest per capita GDP in the world at $80,119 (PPP), with the city having developed into a banking and administrative centre. In the 2011 Mercer worldwide survey of 221 cities, Luxembourg was placed first for personal safety, while it was ranked 19th for quality of living.Luxembourg is one of the de facto capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg), as it is the seat of several institutions, agencies, and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, and Eurostat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Roman era, a fortified tower guarded the crossing of two Roman roads that met at the site of Luxembourg city. Through an exchange treaty with the abbey of Saint Maximin in Trier in 963, Siegfried I of the Ardennes, a close relative of King Louis II of France and Emperor Otto the Great, acquired the feudal lands of Luxembourg. Siegfried built his castle, named Lucilinburhuc (\"small castle\"), on the Bock Fiels (\"rock\"), mentioned for the first time in the aforementioned exchange treaty.\nIn 987, Archbishop Egbert of Trier consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael's Church). At a Roman road intersection near the church, a marketplace appeared around which the city developed.\nThe city, because of its location and natural geography, has through history been a place of strategic military significance. The first fortifications were built as early as the 10th century. By the end of the 12th century, as the city expanded westward around the new St. Nicholas Church (today the Cathedral of Notre Dame), new walls were built that included an area of 5 hectares (12 acres). In about 1340, under the reign of John the Blind, new fortifications were built that stood until 1867.\nIn 1443, the Burgundians under Philip the Good conquered Luxembourg. Luxembourg became part of the Burgundian, and later Spanish and Austrian empires (See Spanish Netherlands and Spanish Road) and under those Habsburg administrations Luxembourg Castle was repeatedly strengthened so that by the 16th century, Luxembourg itself was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. Subsequently, the Burgundians, the Spanish, the French, the Spanish again, the Austrians, the French again, and the Prussians conquered Luxembourg.\nIn the 17th century, the first casemates were built; initially, Spain built 23 km (14 mi) of tunnels, starting in 1644. These were then enlarged under French rule by Marshal Vauban, and augmented again under Austrian rule in the 1730s and 1740s.\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, the city was occupied by France twice: once, briefly, in 1792\u20133, and, later, after a seven-month siege. Luxembourg held out for so long under the French siege that French politician and military engineer Lazare Carnot called Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city's nickname: the 'Gibraltar of the North'.Nonetheless, the Austrian garrison eventually surrendered, and as a consequence, Luxembourg was annexed by the French Republic, becoming part of the d\u00e9partement of For\u00eats, with Luxembourg City as its pr\u00e9fecture. Under the 1815 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars, Luxembourg City was placed under Prussian military control as a part of the German Confederation, although sovereignty passed to the House of Orange-Nassau, in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis, the 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg to dismantle the fortifications in Luxembourg City. Their demolition took sixteen years, cost 1.5 million gold francs, and required the destruction of over 24 km (15 mi) of underground defences and 4 hectares (9.9 acres) of casemates, batteries, barracks, etc. Furthermore, the Prussian garrison was to be withdrawn.\n\nWhen, in 1890, Grand Duke William III died without any male heirs, the Grand Duchy passed out of Dutch hands, and into an independent line under Grand Duke Adolphe. Thus, Luxembourg, which had hitherto been independent in theory only, became a truly independent country, and Luxembourg City regained some of the importance that it had lost in 1867 by becoming the capital of a fully independent state.\nDespite Luxembourg's best efforts to remain neutral in the First World War, it was occupied by Germany on 2 August 1914. On 30 August, Helmuth von Moltke moved his headquarters to Luxembourg City, closer to his armies in France in preparation for a swift victory. However, the victory never came, and Luxembourg would play host to the German high command for another four years. At the end of the occupation, Luxembourg City was the scene of an attempted communist revolution; on 9 November 1918, communists declared a socialist republic, but it lasted only a few hours.In 1921, the city limits were greatly expanded. The communes of Eich, Hamm, Hollerich, and Rollingergrund were incorporated into Luxembourg City, making the city the largest commune in the country (a position that it would hold until 1978).\nIn 1940, Germany occupied Luxembourg again. The Nazis were not prepared to allow Luxembourgers self-government, and gradually integrated Luxembourg into the Third Reich by informally attaching the country administratively to a neighbouring German province. Under the occupation, the capital city's streets all received new, German names, which was announced on 4 October 1940. The Avenue de la Libert\u00e9 for example, a major road leading to the railway station, was renamed \"Adolf-Hitlerstra\u00dfe\". Luxembourg City was liberated on 10 September 1944. The city was under long-range bombardment by the German V-3 cannon in December 1944 and January 1945.\nAfter the war, Luxembourg ended its neutrality, and became a founding member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the European Parliament until 1981. Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Investment Bank. Several departments of the European Commission are also based in Luxembourg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe highest point of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is Kneiff at 560 m, closely followed by Burgplatz at 559 m and Napoleonsgaart at 554 m.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLuxembourg City lies on the southern part of the Luxembourg plateau, a large Early Jurassic sandstone formation that forms the heart of the Gutland, a low-lying and flat area that covers the southern two-thirds of the country.\nThe city centre occupies a picturesque site on a salient, perched high on precipitous cliffs that drop into the narrow valleys of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers, whose confluence is in Luxembourg City. The 70 m (230 ft) deep gorges cut by the rivers are spanned by many bridges and viaducts, including the Adolphe Bridge, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and the Passerelle. Although Luxembourg City is not particularly large, its layout is complex, as the city is set on several levels, straddling hills and dropping into the two gorges.\nThe commune of Luxembourg City covers an area of over 51 km2 (20 sq mi), or 2% of the Grand Duchy's total area. This makes the city the fourth-largest commune in Luxembourg, and by far the largest urban area. Luxembourg City is not particularly densely populated, at about 1,700 people per km2; large areas of Luxembourg City are maintained as parks, forested areas, or sites of important heritage (particularly the UNESCO sites), while there are also large tracts of farmland within the city limits.\n\n\n=== Quarters of Luxembourg City ===\n\nLuxembourg City is subdivided into twenty-four quarters (French: quartiers), which cover the commune in its entirety. The quarters generally correspond to the major neighbourhoods and suburbs of Luxembourg City, although a few of the historic districts, such as Bonnevoie, are divided between two quarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nConsidering its latitude, Luxembourg City has an oceanic climate, with moderate precipitation, cold to cool winters and warm summers. Moderate to heavy cloud cover is present for more than two-thirds of the year.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nUnder the Luxembourgian constitution, local government is centred on the city's communal council. Consisting of twenty-seven members (fixed since 1964), each elected every six years on the second Sunday of October and taking office on 1 January of the next year, the council is the largest of all communal councils in Luxembourg. The city is nowadays considered a stronghold of the Democratic Party (DP), which is the second-largest party nationally. Currently, the Democratic Party is the largest party on the council, with eleven councillors.The city's administration is headed by the mayor, who is the leader of the largest party on the communal council. After Xavier Bettel became Luxembourg's new prime minister on 4 December 2013, Lydie Polfer (DP) was sworn in as new mayor of Luxembourg on 17 December of the same year. The mayor leads the cabinet, the coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal, in which the DP forms a coalition with The Greens. Unlike other cities in Luxembourg, which are limited to four \u00e9chevins at most, Luxembourg is given special dispensation to have six \u00e9chevins on its coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal.\n\n\n=== National government ===\n\nLuxembourg City is the seat for the Luxembourg Government. The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg lives at Berg Castle in Colmar-Berg.\nFor national elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the city is located in the Centre constituency.\n\n\n=== European institutions ===\nLuxembourg City is the seat of several institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank. The majority of these institutions are located in the Kirchberg quarter, in the northeast of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDespite the city's comparatively small size, it has several notable museums: the recently renovated National Museum of History and Art (MNHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam) and National Museum of Natural History (NMHN). The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications. In addition to its two main theatres, the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Capucins, there is a new concert hall, the Philharmonie, as well as a conservatory with a large auditorium. Art galleries include the Villa Vauban, the Casino Luxembourg and Am Tunnel.Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, along with the Romanian city of Sibiu, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.\nLuxembourg City is also famed for its wide selection of restaurants and cuisines, including four Michelin starred establishments.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe ING Europe Marathon has been contested annually in the capital since June 2006. It attracted 11,000 runners and over 100,000 spectators during the 2014 edition\nThe Luxembourg Open is a tennis tournament held since 1991 in the capital. The tournament runs from 13 to 21 October. BGL BNP Paribas, one of the more famous sponsors in the world of tennis, was the contracted title sponsor of the tournament until 2014.\nThe D'Coque National Sporting and Cultural Centre, in the quarter of Kirchberg, is the largest sporting venue in the country, with a capacity of 8,300 for indoor sports and swimming.\nThe two football clubs of the city of Luxembourg; Racing FC Union Luxembourg and FC RM Hamm Benfica, play in the country's highest league, the Luxembourg National Division. The 8,000-seater Stade Josy Barthel hosts the Luxembourg national football team, and CAL Spora Luxembourg, which with 400 members is the nation's largest athletics club.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nPlaces of interest include the Gothic Revival Cathedral of Notre Dame, the fortifications, the AM Tunnel (an art gallery underground), the Grand Ducal Palace, the G\u00eblle Fra war memorial, the casemates, the Neum\u00fcnster Abbey, the Place d'Armes, the Adolphe Bridge and the city hall. The city is the home of the University of Luxembourg and RTL Group.\nThe Second World War Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial is located within the city limits of Luxembourg at Hamm. This cemetery is the final resting place of 5,076 American military dead, including General George S. Patton. There is also a memorial to 371 Americans whose remains were never recovered or identified.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nLuxembourg is situated in the heart of Europe in the Gold Triangle between Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam. It is therefore connected to several motorways and international routes.\n\nA1 (E44): to Grevenmacher and Trier (Germany).\nA3 (E25): to Dudelange and Thionville (France).\nA4: to Esch-sur-Alzette and to A13 to P\u00e9tange, Athus (Belgium) and Longwy (France)\nA6 (E25 / E411): to Arlon and Brussels.\nA7 (E421): to Mersch and Ettelbruck.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nLuxembourg City is served by five rail stations operated by the state rail company, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), including the principal station and terminus of all rail lines in the Grand Duchy, Luxembourg station. Stations in Luxembourg City are served by domestic rail services operated by CFL, as well as international rail services, operated by CFL,  and German, Belgian, and French service providers. Additionally, Luxembourg station is connected to the French LGV Est network, providing high-speed services on to Paris and Strasbourg. Services to Basel and Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland are available via two daily scheduled international trains.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nLuxembourg City has a network of 31 bus routes, operated by the municipal transport authority, Autobus de la Ville de Luxembourg (AVL), partly subcontracted to private bus companies. There is also a free bus service linking the Glacis to Luxembourg station, the \"Joker Line\" for seniors, and a \"City night network\". A \"Park & Ride\"  scheme is operated by the city with five carparks connected to the bus network. In addition to AVL buses, CFL and RGTR operate regional buses to other locales in Luxembourg and nearby cities in Germany and France.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\nOn 10 December 2017, the first stage of Luxembourg City's new tram line opened between Luxexpo and the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge serving the Kirchberg quarter. An extension to the city centre (St\u00e4replaz-\u00c9toile) was opened on 27 July 2018. Further extensions to Luxembourg station, Bonnevoie, Howald, and Cloche d\u2019Or are due to be completed by 2020/21.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLuxembourg City is served by the only international airport in the country: Luxembourg Airport (codes: IATA: LUX, ICAO: ELLX). Accessibility to the airport, situated in the commune of Sandweiler, 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from the city centre, is provided via the municipal bus network, with a tram connection due to be completed by 2021. The airport is the principal hub for Luxembourg's flag carrier, Luxair, and one of the world's largest cargo airlines, Cargolux.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLuxembourg is a member of the QuattroPole union of cities, along with Trier, Saarbr\u00fccken, and Metz (neighbouring countries: Germany and France).\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nLuxembourg is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Luxembourg City\nCessange\nEurovision Song Contest 1962, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1966, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1973, held at the  Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\nEurovision Song Contest 1984, held in the Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of Luxembourg City\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMakos, Adam (2019).

        "wiki": "Neum\u00fcnster Abbey (Luxembourgish: Abtei Neim\u00ebnster, French: Abbaye de Neum\u00fcnster) is a public meeting place and cultural centre, located in the Grund district of Luxembourg City in southern Luxembourg. \nAfter the original Benedictine abbey on the Altm\u00fcnster Plateau had been destroyed in 1542, the monks built a new abbey or \"Neum\u00fcnster\" in 1606 in the Grund. This in turn was destroyed by fire in 1684 but was rebuilt on the same site in 1688 and extended in 1720. After the French Revolution, it served as a police station and prison before becoming a barracks for the Prussians after Napoleon's defeat in 1815. From 1867, it once again became a state prison. Since 1997, it has been the home of the European Institute of Cultural Routes. During World War II, the Nazis used the abbey to imprison political resisters to their occupation of Luxembourg. Among the most notable of those political prisoners was Luxembourg's best-known sculptor Lucien Wercollier.\nFollowing extensive renovation works, Neum\u00fcnster was opened to the public in May 2004 as a meeting place and a cultural centre.  It hosts concerts, exhibitions, and seminars. The abbey is also now home to the Lucien Wercollier Cloister, where many works from the sculptor's private collection are permanently displayed.\nBulgaria and Romania signed their Treaty of Accession to the European Union on 25 April 2005 at Neum\u00fcnster.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistory of the Abbey: Neum\u00fcnster Abbey - an historic urban area, from the CCRN Abbaye de Neum\u00fcnster website\nNeum\u00fcnster Abbey Cultural Exchange Center, neimenster.lu (in English)",

        "wiki": "Am Tunnel is a contemporary art gallery, situated in a tunnel in Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg.  The gallery is located in part of the underground casemates of the city's ancient fortress, under the Bourbon plateau, in the northern part of Gare quarter.  It is connected to the former headquarters of Banque et Caisse d'\u00c9pargne de l'\u00c9tat (BCEE), the third-largest bank based in Luxembourg.In 1987, BCEE launched a plan to extend the former casemate, so that it would connect the bank's four buildings that lie on the plateau.  The possible usage of the tunnel itself was debated, and the idea was formed to turn the tunnel into a gallery.  Construction began in 1992, and the gallery was opened in 1993.  It is primarily dedicated to hosting works by more than a hundred Luxembourgian artists, particularly the photographer Edward Steichen, to whom a permanent collection is dedicated.  However, the gallery also hosts retrospectives of other artists.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==",

        "wiki": "Bourscheid Castle (French: Ch\u00e2teau de Bourscheid, German: Burg Bourscheid, Luxembourgish: Buerg Buerschent) is located near the village of Bourscheid in north-eastern Luxembourg. The medieval castle stands on a site with archeological evidence of structures dating back to Roman times. Standing majestically some 150 metres (490 ft) above the River S\u00fbre, it is enclosed by a circular wall with 11 watchtowers.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlthough first mentioned in records from 1095, the castle appears to have been built around the year 1000 on earlier foundations. It was extended on several occasions: the outer wall dates from 1350, the Stolzembourg house from 1384 and the courtyard from 1477. Behind the gateway from the end of the 15th century, a ditch protected by four towers barred access to the upper and lower castles. The southern and eastern towers are from 1498 and the artillery bastions were built in the 16th century.The extension of the upper part of the castle took place in the 15th century while the great fireplace and tall chimney were completed about a hundred years later. Schenk von Schmidtburg, who acquired the castle at the end of the 18th century, undertook some repair work but was unable to prevent further degradation. In the 19th century, after the chapel collapsed, there was talk of demolishing the building. However, in 1936 it became a listed site and in 1972, with the encouragement of an association called the Friends of the Castle of Bourscheid, the State acquired the building and undertook extensive repairs.

          "At 490ft high above the river Sure, on the steep ridge stands Bourscheid Castle. The chapel, the keep and castle is surrounded by a rampart with four round towers. The outer wall fortified with eight towers were added and completed in 1384. But when the last Lord of the castle",
          "During our trip to the Bourscheid castle, we got an audio tour which was created in the opposite direction of the map we got at the cash register. This made the whole thing a bit confusing, because we constantly had to ignore the guide and go the other way the map showed us.",
          "The castle is located in a beautiful region and the views are very pleasant if not stunning both from the castle and towards the castle (try looking from Bourscheid village for example, the castle is outside the village). The entrance fee is 5 euros for an adult, there are",
          "The castle is beautifully located on a ridge high above the river. While it was left in ruins in the 19th century, some parts have been restored. The audio-guided tour was not as clear and concise as we would have preferred; rather than a series of small panels with just",
          "We visited one rainy Sunday in October and we loved this ruins and castle. We used the audio headphones and that helped. I was with three children and they thought this was a fabulous place to run around and hide in. We were the only ones there too. At times the clouds came",

        "wiki": "Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: L\u00ebtzebuerg, French: Luxembourg, German: Luxemburg), also known as Luxembourg City (Luxembourgish: Stad L\u00ebtzebuerg or d'Stad, French: Ville de Luxembourg, German: Stadt Luxemburg, Luxemburg-Stadt), is the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the country's most populous commune. Standing at the confluence of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers in southern Luxembourg, the city lies at the heart of Western Europe, situated 213 km (132 mi) by road from Brussels, 372 km (231 mi) from Paris, and 209 km (130 mi) from Cologne. The city contains Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.\nAs of 31 December 2019, Luxembourg City has a population of 122,273 inhabitants, which is more than three times the population of the country's second most populous commune (Esch-sur-Alzette). The city's population consists of 160 nationalities. Foreigners represent 70% of the city's population, while Luxembourgers represent 30% of the population, and the number of foreign-born residents in the city rises steadily each year.In 2011, Luxembourg was ranked as having the second-highest per capita GDP in the world at $80,119 (PPP), with the city having developed into a banking and administrative centre. In the 2011 Mercer worldwide survey of 221 cities, Luxembourg was placed first for personal safety, while it was ranked 19th for quality of living.Luxembourg is one of the de facto capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg), as it is the seat of several institutions, agencies, and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, and Eurostat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Roman era, a fortified tower guarded the crossing of two Roman roads that met at the site of Luxembourg city. Through an exchange treaty with the abbey of Saint Maximin in Trier in 963, Siegfried I of the Ardennes, a close relative of King Louis II of France and Emperor Otto the Great, acquired the feudal lands of Luxembourg. Siegfried built his castle, named Lucilinburhuc (\"small castle\"), on the Bock Fiels (\"rock\"), mentioned for the first time in the aforementioned exchange treaty.\nIn 987, Archbishop Egbert of Trier consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael's Church). At a Roman road intersection near the church, a marketplace appeared around which the city developed.\nThe city, because of its location and natural geography, has through history been a place of strategic military significance. The first fortifications were built as early as the 10th century. By the end of the 12th century, as the city expanded westward around the new St. Nicholas Church (today the Cathedral of Notre Dame), new walls were built that included an area of 5 hectares (12 acres). In about 1340, under the reign of John the Blind, new fortifications were built that stood until 1867.\nIn 1443, the Burgundians under Philip the Good conquered Luxembourg. Luxembourg became part of the Burgundian, and later Spanish and Austrian empires (See Spanish Netherlands and Spanish Road) and under those Habsburg administrations Luxembourg Castle was repeatedly strengthened so that by the 16th century, Luxembourg itself was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. Subsequently, the Burgundians, the Spanish, the French, the Spanish again, the Austrians, the French again, and the Prussians conquered Luxembourg.\nIn the 17th century, the first casemates were built; initially, Spain built 23 km (14 mi) of tunnels, starting in 1644. These were then enlarged under French rule by Marshal Vauban, and augmented again under Austrian rule in the 1730s and 1740s.\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, the city was occupied by France twice: once, briefly, in 1792\u20133, and, later, after a seven-month siege. Luxembourg held out for so long under the French siege that French politician and military engineer Lazare Carnot called Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city's nickname: the 'Gibraltar of the North'.Nonetheless, the Austrian garrison eventually surrendered, and as a consequence, Luxembourg was annexed by the French Republic, becoming part of the d\u00e9partement of For\u00eats, with Luxembourg City as its pr\u00e9fecture. Under the 1815 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars, Luxembourg City was placed under Prussian military control as a part of the German Confederation, although sovereignty passed to the House of Orange-Nassau, in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis, the 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg to dismantle the fortifications in Luxembourg City. Their demolition took sixteen years, cost 1.5 million gold francs, and required the destruction of over 24 km (15 mi) of underground defences and 4 hectares (9.9 acres) of casemates, batteries, barracks, etc. Furthermore, the Prussian garrison was to be withdrawn.\n\nWhen, in 1890, Grand Duke William III died without any male heirs, the Grand Duchy passed out of Dutch hands, and into an independent line under Grand Duke Adolphe. Thus, Luxembourg, which had hitherto been independent in theory only, became a truly independent country, and Luxembourg City regained some of the importance that it had lost in 1867 by becoming the capital of a fully independent state.\nDespite Luxembourg's best efforts to remain neutral in the First World War, it was occupied by Germany on 2 August 1914. On 30 August, Helmuth von Moltke moved his headquarters to Luxembourg City, closer to his armies in France in preparation for a swift victory. However, the victory never came, and Luxembourg would play host to the German high command for another four years. At the end of the occupation, Luxembourg City was the scene of an attempted communist revolution; on 9 November 1918, communists declared a socialist republic, but it lasted only a few hours.In 1921, the city limits were greatly expanded. The communes of Eich, Hamm, Hollerich, and Rollingergrund were incorporated into Luxembourg City, making the city the largest commune in the country (a position that it would hold until 1978).\nIn 1940, Germany occupied Luxembourg again. The Nazis were not prepared to allow Luxembourgers self-government, and gradually integrated Luxembourg into the Third Reich by informally attaching the country administratively to a neighbouring German province. Under the occupation, the capital city's streets all received new, German names, which was announced on 4 October 1940. The Avenue de la Libert\u00e9 for example, a major road leading to the railway station, was renamed \"Adolf-Hitlerstra\u00dfe\". Luxembourg City was liberated on 10 September 1944. The city was under long-range bombardment by the German V-3 cannon in December 1944 and January 1945.\nAfter the war, Luxembourg ended its neutrality, and became a founding member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the European Parliament until 1981. Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Investment Bank. Several departments of the European Commission are also based in Luxembourg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe highest point of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is Kneiff at 560 m, closely followed by Burgplatz at 559 m and Napoleonsgaart at 554 m.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLuxembourg City lies on the southern part of the Luxembourg plateau, a large Early Jurassic sandstone formation that forms the heart of the Gutland, a low-lying and flat area that covers the southern two-thirds of the country.\nThe city centre occupies a picturesque site on a salient, perched high on precipitous cliffs that drop into the narrow valleys of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers, whose confluence is in Luxembourg City. The 70 m (230 ft) deep gorges cut by the rivers are spanned by many bridges and viaducts, including the Adolphe Bridge, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and the Passerelle. Although Luxembourg City is not particularly large, its layout is complex, as the city is set on several levels, straddling hills and dropping into the two gorges.\nThe commune of Luxembourg City covers an area of over 51 km2 (20 sq mi), or 2% of the Grand Duchy's total area. This makes the city the fourth-largest commune in Luxembourg, and by far the largest urban area. Luxembourg City is not particularly densely populated, at about 1,700 people per km2; large areas of Luxembourg City are maintained as parks, forested areas, or sites of important heritage (particularly the UNESCO sites), while there are also large tracts of farmland within the city limits.\n\n\n=== Quarters of Luxembourg City ===\n\nLuxembourg City is subdivided into twenty-four quarters (French: quartiers), which cover the commune in its entirety. The quarters generally correspond to the major neighbourhoods and suburbs of Luxembourg City, although a few of the historic districts, such as Bonnevoie, are divided between two quarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nConsidering its latitude, Luxembourg City has an oceanic climate, with moderate precipitation, cold to cool winters and warm summers. Moderate to heavy cloud cover is present for more than two-thirds of the year.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nUnder the Luxembourgian constitution, local government is centred on the city's communal council. Consisting of twenty-seven members (fixed since 1964), each elected every six years on the second Sunday of October and taking office on 1 January of the next year, the council is the largest of all communal councils in Luxembourg. The city is nowadays considered a stronghold of the Democratic Party (DP), which is the second-largest party nationally. Currently, the Democratic Party is the largest party on the council, with eleven councillors.The city's administration is headed by the mayor, who is the leader of the largest party on the communal council. After Xavier Bettel became Luxembourg's new prime minister on 4 December 2013, Lydie Polfer (DP) was sworn in as new mayor of Luxembourg on 17 December of the same year. The mayor leads the cabinet, the coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal, in which the DP forms a coalition with The Greens. Unlike other cities in Luxembourg, which are limited to four \u00e9chevins at most, Luxembourg is given special dispensation to have six \u00e9chevins on its coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal.\n\n\n=== National government ===\n\nLuxembourg City is the seat for the Luxembourg Government. The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg lives at Berg Castle in Colmar-Berg.\nFor national elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the city is located in the Centre constituency.\n\n\n=== European institutions ===\nLuxembourg City is the seat of several institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank. The majority of these institutions are located in the Kirchberg quarter, in the northeast of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDespite the city's comparatively small size, it has several notable museums: the recently renovated National Museum of History and Art (MNHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam) and National Museum of Natural History (NMHN). The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications. In addition to its two main theatres, the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Capucins, there is a new concert hall, the Philharmonie, as well as a conservatory with a large auditorium. Art galleries include the Villa Vauban, the Casino Luxembourg and Am Tunnel.Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, along with the Romanian city of Sibiu, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.\nLuxembourg City is also famed for its wide selection of restaurants and cuisines, including four Michelin starred establishments.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe ING Europe Marathon has been contested annually in the capital since June 2006. It attracted 11,000 runners and over 100,000 spectators during the 2014 edition\nThe Luxembourg Open is a tennis tournament held since 1991 in the capital. The tournament runs from 13 to 21 October. BGL BNP Paribas, one of the more famous sponsors in the world of tennis, was the contracted title sponsor of the tournament until 2014.\nThe D'Coque National Sporting and Cultural Centre, in the quarter of Kirchberg, is the largest sporting venue in the country, with a capacity of 8,300 for indoor sports and swimming.\nThe two football clubs of the city of Luxembourg; Racing FC Union Luxembourg and FC RM Hamm Benfica, play in the country's highest league, the Luxembourg National Division. The 8,000-seater Stade Josy Barthel hosts the Luxembourg national football team, and CAL Spora Luxembourg, which with 400 members is the nation's largest athletics club.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nPlaces of interest include the Gothic Revival Cathedral of Notre Dame, the fortifications, the AM Tunnel (an art gallery underground), the Grand Ducal Palace, the G\u00eblle Fra war memorial, the casemates, the Neum\u00fcnster Abbey, the Place d'Armes, the Adolphe Bridge and the city hall. The city is the home of the University of Luxembourg and RTL Group.\nThe Second World War Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial is located within the city limits of Luxembourg at Hamm. This cemetery is the final resting place of 5,076 American military dead, including General George S. Patton. There is also a memorial to 371 Americans whose remains were never recovered or identified.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nLuxembourg is situated in the heart of Europe in the Gold Triangle between Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam. It is therefore connected to several motorways and international routes.\n\nA1 (E44): to Grevenmacher and Trier (Germany).\nA3 (E25): to Dudelange and Thionville (France).\nA4: to Esch-sur-Alzette and to A13 to P\u00e9tange, Athus (Belgium) and Longwy (France)\nA6 (E25 / E411): to Arlon and Brussels.\nA7 (E421): to Mersch and Ettelbruck.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nLuxembourg City is served by five rail stations operated by the state rail company, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), including the principal station and terminus of all rail lines in the Grand Duchy, Luxembourg station. Stations in Luxembourg City are served by domestic rail services operated by CFL, as well as international rail services, operated by CFL,  and German, Belgian, and French service providers. Additionally, Luxembourg station is connected to the French LGV Est network, providing high-speed services on to Paris and Strasbourg. Services to Basel and Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland are available via two daily scheduled international trains.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nLuxembourg City has a network of 31 bus routes, operated by the municipal transport authority, Autobus de la Ville de Luxembourg (AVL), partly subcontracted to private bus companies. There is also a free bus service linking the Glacis to Luxembourg station, the \"Joker Line\" for seniors, and a \"City night network\". A \"Park & Ride\"  scheme is operated by the city with five carparks connected to the bus network. In addition to AVL buses, CFL and RGTR operate regional buses to other locales in Luxembourg and nearby cities in Germany and France.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\nOn 10 December 2017, the first stage of Luxembourg City's new tram line opened between Luxexpo and the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge serving the Kirchberg quarter. An extension to the city centre (St\u00e4replaz-\u00c9toile) was opened on 27 July 2018. Further extensions to Luxembourg station, Bonnevoie, Howald, and Cloche d\u2019Or are due to be completed by 2020/21.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLuxembourg City is served by the only international airport in the country: Luxembourg Airport (codes: IATA: LUX, ICAO: ELLX). Accessibility to the airport, situated in the commune of Sandweiler, 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from the city centre, is provided via the municipal bus network, with a tram connection due to be completed by 2021. The airport is the principal hub for Luxembourg's flag carrier, Luxair, and one of the world's largest cargo airlines, Cargolux.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLuxembourg is a member of the QuattroPole union of cities, along with Trier, Saarbr\u00fccken, and Metz (neighbouring countries: Germany and France).\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nLuxembourg is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Luxembourg City\nCessange\nEurovision Song Contest 1962, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1966, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1973, held at the  Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\nEurovision Song Contest 1984, held in the Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of Luxembourg City\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMakos, Adam (2019).

          "I was expecting to have way more given the budget. The building looks great from the outside and with no doubt is an icon of city. Whether walking around or driving it is hard to don't take a second to enjoy the architecture.",

        "wiki": "Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: L\u00ebtzebuerg, French: Luxembourg, German: Luxemburg), also known as Luxembourg City (Luxembourgish: Stad L\u00ebtzebuerg or d'Stad, French: Ville de Luxembourg, German: Stadt Luxemburg, Luxemburg-Stadt), is the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the country's most populous commune. Standing at the confluence of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers in southern Luxembourg, the city lies at the heart of Western Europe, situated 213 km (132 mi) by road from Brussels, 372 km (231 mi) from Paris, and 209 km (130 mi) from Cologne. The city contains Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.\nAs of 31 December 2019, Luxembourg City has a population of 122,273 inhabitants, which is more than three times the population of the country's second most populous commune (Esch-sur-Alzette). The city's population consists of 160 nationalities. Foreigners represent 70% of the city's population, while Luxembourgers represent 30% of the population, and the number of foreign-born residents in the city rises steadily each year.In 2011, Luxembourg was ranked as having the second-highest per capita GDP in the world at $80,119 (PPP), with the city having developed into a banking and administrative centre. In the 2011 Mercer worldwide survey of 221 cities, Luxembourg was placed first for personal safety, while it was ranked 19th for quality of living.Luxembourg is one of the de facto capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg), as it is the seat of several institutions, agencies, and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, and Eurostat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Roman era, a fortified tower guarded the crossing of two Roman roads that met at the site of Luxembourg city. Through an exchange treaty with the abbey of Saint Maximin in Trier in 963, Siegfried I of the Ardennes, a close relative of King Louis II of France and Emperor Otto the Great, acquired the feudal lands of Luxembourg. Siegfried built his castle, named Lucilinburhuc (\"small castle\"), on the Bock Fiels (\"rock\"), mentioned for the first time in the aforementioned exchange treaty.\nIn 987, Archbishop Egbert of Trier consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael's Church). At a Roman road intersection near the church, a marketplace appeared around which the city developed.\nThe city, because of its location and natural geography, has through history been a place of strategic military significance. The first fortifications were built as early as the 10th century. By the end of the 12th century, as the city expanded westward around the new St. Nicholas Church (today the Cathedral of Notre Dame), new walls were built that included an area of 5 hectares (12 acres). In about 1340, under the reign of John the Blind, new fortifications were built that stood until 1867.\nIn 1443, the Burgundians under Philip the Good conquered Luxembourg. Luxembourg became part of the Burgundian, and later Spanish and Austrian empires (See Spanish Netherlands and Spanish Road) and under those Habsburg administrations Luxembourg Castle was repeatedly strengthened so that by the 16th century, Luxembourg itself was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. Subsequently, the Burgundians, the Spanish, the French, the Spanish again, the Austrians, the French again, and the Prussians conquered Luxembourg.\nIn the 17th century, the first casemates were built; initially, Spain built 23 km (14 mi) of tunnels, starting in 1644. These were then enlarged under French rule by Marshal Vauban, and augmented again under Austrian rule in the 1730s and 1740s.\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, the city was occupied by France twice: once, briefly, in 1792\u20133, and, later, after a seven-month siege. Luxembourg held out for so long under the French siege that French politician and military engineer Lazare Carnot called Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city's nickname: the 'Gibraltar of the North'.Nonetheless, the Austrian garrison eventually surrendered, and as a consequence, Luxembourg was annexed by the French Republic, becoming part of the d\u00e9partement of For\u00eats, with Luxembourg City as its pr\u00e9fecture. Under the 1815 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars, Luxembourg City was placed under Prussian military control as a part of the German Confederation, although sovereignty passed to the House of Orange-Nassau, in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis, the 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg to dismantle the fortifications in Luxembourg City. Their demolition took sixteen years, cost 1.5 million gold francs, and required the destruction of over 24 km (15 mi) of underground defences and 4 hectares (9.9 acres) of casemates, batteries, barracks, etc. Furthermore, the Prussian garrison was to be withdrawn.\n\nWhen, in 1890, Grand Duke William III died without any male heirs, the Grand Duchy passed out of Dutch hands, and into an independent line under Grand Duke Adolphe. Thus, Luxembourg, which had hitherto been independent in theory only, became a truly independent country, and Luxembourg City regained some of the importance that it had lost in 1867 by becoming the capital of a fully independent state.\nDespite Luxembourg's best efforts to remain neutral in the First World War, it was occupied by Germany on 2 August 1914. On 30 August, Helmuth von Moltke moved his headquarters to Luxembourg City, closer to his armies in France in preparation for a swift victory. However, the victory never came, and Luxembourg would play host to the German high command for another four years. At the end of the occupation, Luxembourg City was the scene of an attempted communist revolution; on 9 November 1918, communists declared a socialist republic, but it lasted only a few hours.In 1921, the city limits were greatly expanded. The communes of Eich, Hamm, Hollerich, and Rollingergrund were incorporated into Luxembourg City, making the city the largest commune in the country (a position that it would hold until 1978).\nIn 1940, Germany occupied Luxembourg again. The Nazis were not prepared to allow Luxembourgers self-government, and gradually integrated Luxembourg into the Third Reich by informally attaching the country administratively to a neighbouring German province. Under the occupation, the capital city's streets all received new, German names, which was announced on 4 October 1940. The Avenue de la Libert\u00e9 for example, a major road leading to the railway station, was renamed \"Adolf-Hitlerstra\u00dfe\". Luxembourg City was liberated on 10 September 1944. The city was under long-range bombardment by the German V-3 cannon in December 1944 and January 1945.\nAfter the war, Luxembourg ended its neutrality, and became a founding member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the European Parliament until 1981. Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Investment Bank. Several departments of the European Commission are also based in Luxembourg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe highest point of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is Kneiff at 560 m, closely followed by Burgplatz at 559 m and Napoleonsgaart at 554 m.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLuxembourg City lies on the southern part of the Luxembourg plateau, a large Early Jurassic sandstone formation that forms the heart of the Gutland, a low-lying and flat area that covers the southern two-thirds of the country.\nThe city centre occupies a picturesque site on a salient, perched high on precipitous cliffs that drop into the narrow valleys of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers, whose confluence is in Luxembourg City. The 70 m (230 ft) deep gorges cut by the rivers are spanned by many bridges and viaducts, including the Adolphe Bridge, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and the Passerelle. Although Luxembourg City is not particularly large, its layout is complex, as the city is set on several levels, straddling hills and dropping into the two gorges.\nThe commune of Luxembourg City covers an area of over 51 km2 (20 sq mi), or 2% of the Grand Duchy's total area. This makes the city the fourth-largest commune in Luxembourg, and by far the largest urban area. Luxembourg City is not particularly densely populated, at about 1,700 people per km2; large areas of Luxembourg City are maintained as parks, forested areas, or sites of important heritage (particularly the UNESCO sites), while there are also large tracts of farmland within the city limits.\n\n\n=== Quarters of Luxembourg City ===\n\nLuxembourg City is subdivided into twenty-four quarters (French: quartiers), which cover the commune in its entirety. The quarters generally correspond to the major neighbourhoods and suburbs of Luxembourg City, although a few of the historic districts, such as Bonnevoie, are divided between two quarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nConsidering its latitude, Luxembourg City has an oceanic climate, with moderate precipitation, cold to cool winters and warm summers. Moderate to heavy cloud cover is present for more than two-thirds of the year.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nUnder the Luxembourgian constitution, local government is centred on the city's communal council. Consisting of twenty-seven members (fixed since 1964), each elected every six years on the second Sunday of October and taking office on 1 January of the next year, the council is the largest of all communal councils in Luxembourg. The city is nowadays considered a stronghold of the Democratic Party (DP), which is the second-largest party nationally. Currently, the Democratic Party is the largest party on the council, with eleven councillors.The city's administration is headed by the mayor, who is the leader of the largest party on the communal council. After Xavier Bettel became Luxembourg's new prime minister on 4 December 2013, Lydie Polfer (DP) was sworn in as new mayor of Luxembourg on 17 December of the same year. The mayor leads the cabinet, the coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal, in which the DP forms a coalition with The Greens. Unlike other cities in Luxembourg, which are limited to four \u00e9chevins at most, Luxembourg is given special dispensation to have six \u00e9chevins on its coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal.\n\n\n=== National government ===\n\nLuxembourg City is the seat for the Luxembourg Government. The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg lives at Berg Castle in Colmar-Berg.\nFor national elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the city is located in the Centre constituency.\n\n\n=== European institutions ===\nLuxembourg City is the seat of several institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank. The majority of these institutions are located in the Kirchberg quarter, in the northeast of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDespite the city's comparatively small size, it has several notable museums: the recently renovated National Museum of History and Art (MNHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam) and National Museum of Natural History (NMHN). The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications. In addition to its two main theatres, the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Capucins, there is a new concert hall, the Philharmonie, as well as a conservatory with a large auditorium. Art galleries include the Villa Vauban, the Casino Luxembourg and Am Tunnel.Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, along with the Romanian city of Sibiu, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.\nLuxembourg City is also famed for its wide selection of restaurants and cuisines, including four Michelin starred establishments.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe ING Europe Marathon has been contested annually in the capital since June 2006. It attracted 11,000 runners and over 100,000 spectators during the 2014 edition\nThe Luxembourg Open is a tennis tournament held since 1991 in the capital. The tournament runs from 13 to 21 October. BGL BNP Paribas, one of the more famous sponsors in the world of tennis, was the contracted title sponsor of the tournament until 2014.\nThe D'Coque National Sporting and Cultural Centre, in the quarter of Kirchberg, is the largest sporting venue in the country, with a capacity of 8,300 for indoor sports and swimming.\nThe two football clubs of the city of Luxembourg; Racing FC Union Luxembourg and FC RM Hamm Benfica, play in the country's highest league, the Luxembourg National Division. The 8,000-seater Stade Josy Barthel hosts the Luxembourg national football team, and CAL Spora Luxembourg, which with 400 members is the nation's largest athletics club.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nPlaces of interest include the Gothic Revival Cathedral of Notre Dame, the fortifications, the AM Tunnel (an art gallery underground), the Grand Ducal Palace, the G\u00eblle Fra war memorial, the casemates, the Neum\u00fcnster Abbey, the Place d'Armes, the Adolphe Bridge and the city hall. The city is the home of the University of Luxembourg and RTL Group.\nThe Second World War Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial is located within the city limits of Luxembourg at Hamm. This cemetery is the final resting place of 5,076 American military dead, including General George S. Patton. There is also a memorial to 371 Americans whose remains were never recovered or identified.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nLuxembourg is situated in the heart of Europe in the Gold Triangle between Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam. It is therefore connected to several motorways and international routes.\n\nA1 (E44): to Grevenmacher and Trier (Germany).\nA3 (E25): to Dudelange and Thionville (France).\nA4: to Esch-sur-Alzette and to A13 to P\u00e9tange, Athus (Belgium) and Longwy (France)\nA6 (E25 / E411): to Arlon and Brussels.\nA7 (E421): to Mersch and Ettelbruck.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nLuxembourg City is served by five rail stations operated by the state rail company, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), including the principal station and terminus of all rail lines in the Grand Duchy, Luxembourg station. Stations in Luxembourg City are served by domestic rail services operated by CFL, as well as international rail services, operated by CFL,  and German, Belgian, and French service providers. Additionally, Luxembourg station is connected to the French LGV Est network, providing high-speed services on to Paris and Strasbourg. Services to Basel and Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland are available via two daily scheduled international trains.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nLuxembourg City has a network of 31 bus routes, operated by the municipal transport authority, Autobus de la Ville de Luxembourg (AVL), partly subcontracted to private bus companies. There is also a free bus service linking the Glacis to Luxembourg station, the \"Joker Line\" for seniors, and a \"City night network\". A \"Park & Ride\"  scheme is operated by the city with five carparks connected to the bus network. In addition to AVL buses, CFL and RGTR operate regional buses to other locales in Luxembourg and nearby cities in Germany and France.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\nOn 10 December 2017, the first stage of Luxembourg City's new tram line opened between Luxexpo and the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge serving the Kirchberg quarter. An extension to the city centre (St\u00e4replaz-\u00c9toile) was opened on 27 July 2018. Further extensions to Luxembourg station, Bonnevoie, Howald, and Cloche d\u2019Or are due to be completed by 2020/21.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLuxembourg City is served by the only international airport in the country: Luxembourg Airport (codes: IATA: LUX, ICAO: ELLX). Accessibility to the airport, situated in the commune of Sandweiler, 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from the city centre, is provided via the municipal bus network, with a tram connection due to be completed by 2021. The airport is the principal hub for Luxembourg's flag carrier, Luxair, and one of the world's largest cargo airlines, Cargolux.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLuxembourg is a member of the QuattroPole union of cities, along with Trier, Saarbr\u00fccken, and Metz (neighbouring countries: Germany and France).\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nLuxembourg is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Luxembourg City\nCessange\nEurovision Song Contest 1962, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1966, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1973, held at the  Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\nEurovision Song Contest 1984, held in the Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of Luxembourg City\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMakos, Adam (2019).

        "wiki": "Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: L\u00ebtzebuerg, French: Luxembourg, German: Luxemburg), also known as Luxembourg City (Luxembourgish: Stad L\u00ebtzebuerg or d'Stad, French: Ville de Luxembourg, German: Stadt Luxemburg, Luxemburg-Stadt), is the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the country's most populous commune. Standing at the confluence of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers in southern Luxembourg, the city lies at the heart of Western Europe, situated 213 km (132 mi) by road from Brussels, 372 km (231 mi) from Paris, and 209 km (130 mi) from Cologne. The city contains Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed.\nAs of 31 December 2019, Luxembourg City has a population of 122,273 inhabitants, which is more than three times the population of the country's second most populous commune (Esch-sur-Alzette). The city's population consists of 160 nationalities. Foreigners represent 70% of the city's population, while Luxembourgers represent 30% of the population, and the number of foreign-born residents in the city rises steadily each year.In 2011, Luxembourg was ranked as having the second-highest per capita GDP in the world at $80,119 (PPP), with the city having developed into a banking and administrative centre. In the 2011 Mercer worldwide survey of 221 cities, Luxembourg was placed first for personal safety, while it was ranked 19th for quality of living.Luxembourg is one of the de facto capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg), as it is the seat of several institutions, agencies, and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, and Eurostat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Roman era, a fortified tower guarded the crossing of two Roman roads that met at the site of Luxembourg city. Through an exchange treaty with the abbey of Saint Maximin in Trier in 963, Siegfried I of the Ardennes, a close relative of King Louis II of France and Emperor Otto the Great, acquired the feudal lands of Luxembourg. Siegfried built his castle, named Lucilinburhuc (\"small castle\"), on the Bock Fiels (\"rock\"), mentioned for the first time in the aforementioned exchange treaty.\nIn 987, Archbishop Egbert of Trier consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael's Church). At a Roman road intersection near the church, a marketplace appeared around which the city developed.\nThe city, because of its location and natural geography, has through history been a place of strategic military significance. The first fortifications were built as early as the 10th century. By the end of the 12th century, as the city expanded westward around the new St. Nicholas Church (today the Cathedral of Notre Dame), new walls were built that included an area of 5 hectares (12 acres). In about 1340, under the reign of John the Blind, new fortifications were built that stood until 1867.\nIn 1443, the Burgundians under Philip the Good conquered Luxembourg. Luxembourg became part of the Burgundian, and later Spanish and Austrian empires (See Spanish Netherlands and Spanish Road) and under those Habsburg administrations Luxembourg Castle was repeatedly strengthened so that by the 16th century, Luxembourg itself was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. Subsequently, the Burgundians, the Spanish, the French, the Spanish again, the Austrians, the French again, and the Prussians conquered Luxembourg.\nIn the 17th century, the first casemates were built; initially, Spain built 23 km (14 mi) of tunnels, starting in 1644. These were then enlarged under French rule by Marshal Vauban, and augmented again under Austrian rule in the 1730s and 1740s.\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, the city was occupied by France twice: once, briefly, in 1792\u20133, and, later, after a seven-month siege. Luxembourg held out for so long under the French siege that French politician and military engineer Lazare Carnot called Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city's nickname: the 'Gibraltar of the North'.Nonetheless, the Austrian garrison eventually surrendered, and as a consequence, Luxembourg was annexed by the French Republic, becoming part of the d\u00e9partement of For\u00eats, with Luxembourg City as its pr\u00e9fecture. Under the 1815 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars, Luxembourg City was placed under Prussian military control as a part of the German Confederation, although sovereignty passed to the House of Orange-Nassau, in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis, the 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg to dismantle the fortifications in Luxembourg City. Their demolition took sixteen years, cost 1.5 million gold francs, and required the destruction of over 24 km (15 mi) of underground defences and 4 hectares (9.9 acres) of casemates, batteries, barracks, etc. Furthermore, the Prussian garrison was to be withdrawn.\n\nWhen, in 1890, Grand Duke William III died without any male heirs, the Grand Duchy passed out of Dutch hands, and into an independent line under Grand Duke Adolphe. Thus, Luxembourg, which had hitherto been independent in theory only, became a truly independent country, and Luxembourg City regained some of the importance that it had lost in 1867 by becoming the capital of a fully independent state.\nDespite Luxembourg's best efforts to remain neutral in the First World War, it was occupied by Germany on 2 August 1914. On 30 August, Helmuth von Moltke moved his headquarters to Luxembourg City, closer to his armies in France in preparation for a swift victory. However, the victory never came, and Luxembourg would play host to the German high command for another four years. At the end of the occupation, Luxembourg City was the scene of an attempted communist revolution; on 9 November 1918, communists declared a socialist republic, but it lasted only a few hours.In 1921, the city limits were greatly expanded. The communes of Eich, Hamm, Hollerich, and Rollingergrund were incorporated into Luxembourg City, making the city the largest commune in the country (a position that it would hold until 1978).\nIn 1940, Germany occupied Luxembourg again. The Nazis were not prepared to allow Luxembourgers self-government, and gradually integrated Luxembourg into the Third Reich by informally attaching the country administratively to a neighbouring German province. Under the occupation, the capital city's streets all received new, German names, which was announced on 4 October 1940. The Avenue de la Libert\u00e9 for example, a major road leading to the railway station, was renamed \"Adolf-Hitlerstra\u00dfe\". Luxembourg City was liberated on 10 September 1944. The city was under long-range bombardment by the German V-3 cannon in December 1944 and January 1945.\nAfter the war, Luxembourg ended its neutrality, and became a founding member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the European Parliament until 1981. Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Investment Bank. Several departments of the European Commission are also based in Luxembourg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe highest point of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is Kneiff at 560 m, closely followed by Burgplatz at 559 m and Napoleonsgaart at 554 m.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nLuxembourg City lies on the southern part of the Luxembourg plateau, a large Early Jurassic sandstone formation that forms the heart of the Gutland, a low-lying and flat area that covers the southern two-thirds of the country.\nThe city centre occupies a picturesque site on a salient, perched high on precipitous cliffs that drop into the narrow valleys of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers, whose confluence is in Luxembourg City. The 70 m (230 ft) deep gorges cut by the rivers are spanned by many bridges and viaducts, including the Adolphe Bridge, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and the Passerelle. Although Luxembourg City is not particularly large, its layout is complex, as the city is set on several levels, straddling hills and dropping into the two gorges.\nThe commune of Luxembourg City covers an area of over 51 km2 (20 sq mi), or 2% of the Grand Duchy's total area. This makes the city the fourth-largest commune in Luxembourg, and by far the largest urban area. Luxembourg City is not particularly densely populated, at about 1,700 people per km2; large areas of Luxembourg City are maintained as parks, forested areas, or sites of important heritage (particularly the UNESCO sites), while there are also large tracts of farmland within the city limits.\n\n\n=== Quarters of Luxembourg City ===\n\nLuxembourg City is subdivided into twenty-four quarters (French: quartiers), which cover the commune in its entirety. The quarters generally correspond to the major neighbourhoods and suburbs of Luxembourg City, although a few of the historic districts, such as Bonnevoie, are divided between two quarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nConsidering its latitude, Luxembourg City has an oceanic climate, with moderate precipitation, cold to cool winters and warm summers. Moderate to heavy cloud cover is present for more than two-thirds of the year.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nUnder the Luxembourgian constitution, local government is centred on the city's communal council. Consisting of twenty-seven members (fixed since 1964), each elected every six years on the second Sunday of October and taking office on 1 January of the next year, the council is the largest of all communal councils in Luxembourg. The city is nowadays considered a stronghold of the Democratic Party (DP), which is the second-largest party nationally. Currently, the Democratic Party is the largest party on the council, with eleven councillors.The city's administration is headed by the mayor, who is the leader of the largest party on the communal council. After Xavier Bettel became Luxembourg's new prime minister on 4 December 2013, Lydie Polfer (DP) was sworn in as new mayor of Luxembourg on 17 December of the same year. The mayor leads the cabinet, the coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal, in which the DP forms a coalition with The Greens. Unlike other cities in Luxembourg, which are limited to four \u00e9chevins at most, Luxembourg is given special dispensation to have six \u00e9chevins on its coll\u00e8ge \u00e9chevinal.\n\n\n=== National government ===\n\nLuxembourg City is the seat for the Luxembourg Government. The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg lives at Berg Castle in Colmar-Berg.\nFor national elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the city is located in the Centre constituency.\n\n\n=== European institutions ===\nLuxembourg City is the seat of several institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank. The majority of these institutions are located in the Kirchberg quarter, in the northeast of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nDespite the city's comparatively small size, it has several notable museums: the recently renovated National Museum of History and Art (MNHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam) and National Museum of Natural History (NMHN). The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications. In addition to its two main theatres, the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Capucins, there is a new concert hall, the Philharmonie, as well as a conservatory with a large auditorium. Art galleries include the Villa Vauban, the Casino Luxembourg and Am Tunnel.Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, along with the Romanian city of Sibiu, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.\nLuxembourg City is also famed for its wide selection of restaurants and cuisines, including four Michelin starred establishments.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe ING Europe Marathon has been contested annually in the capital since June 2006. It attracted 11,000 runners and over 100,000 spectators during the 2014 edition\nThe Luxembourg Open is a tennis tournament held since 1991 in the capital. The tournament runs from 13 to 21 October. BGL BNP Paribas, one of the more famous sponsors in the world of tennis, was the contracted title sponsor of the tournament until 2014.\nThe D'Coque National Sporting and Cultural Centre, in the quarter of Kirchberg, is the largest sporting venue in the country, with a capacity of 8,300 for indoor sports and swimming.\nThe two football clubs of the city of Luxembourg; Racing FC Union Luxembourg and FC RM Hamm Benfica, play in the country's highest league, the Luxembourg National Division. The 8,000-seater Stade Josy Barthel hosts the Luxembourg national football team, and CAL Spora Luxembourg, which with 400 members is the nation's largest athletics club.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nPlaces of interest include the Gothic Revival Cathedral of Notre Dame, the fortifications, the AM Tunnel (an art gallery underground), the Grand Ducal Palace, the G\u00eblle Fra war memorial, the casemates, the Neum\u00fcnster Abbey, the Place d'Armes, the Adolphe Bridge and the city hall. The city is the home of the University of Luxembourg and RTL Group.\nThe Second World War Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial is located within the city limits of Luxembourg at Hamm. This cemetery is the final resting place of 5,076 American military dead, including General George S. Patton. There is also a memorial to 371 Americans whose remains were never recovered or identified.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nLuxembourg is situated in the heart of Europe in the Gold Triangle between Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam. It is therefore connected to several motorways and international routes.\n\nA1 (E44): to Grevenmacher and Trier (Germany).\nA3 (E25): to Dudelange and Thionville (France).\nA4: to Esch-sur-Alzette and to A13 to P\u00e9tange, Athus (Belgium) and Longwy (France)\nA6 (E25 / E411): to Arlon and Brussels.\nA7 (E421): to Mersch and Ettelbruck.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nLuxembourg City is served by five rail stations operated by the state rail company, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), including the principal station and terminus of all rail lines in the Grand Duchy, Luxembourg station. Stations in Luxembourg City are served by domestic rail services operated by CFL, as well as international rail services, operated by CFL,  and German, Belgian, and French service providers. Additionally, Luxembourg station is connected to the French LGV Est network, providing high-speed services on to Paris and Strasbourg. Services to Basel and Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland are available via two daily scheduled international trains.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nLuxembourg City has a network of 31 bus routes, operated by the municipal transport authority, Autobus de la Ville de Luxembourg (AVL), partly subcontracted to private bus companies. There is also a free bus service linking the Glacis to Luxembourg station, the \"Joker Line\" for seniors, and a \"City night network\". A \"Park & Ride\"  scheme is operated by the city with five carparks connected to the bus network. In addition to AVL buses, CFL and RGTR operate regional buses to other locales in Luxembourg and nearby cities in Germany and France.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\nOn 10 December 2017, the first stage of Luxembourg City's new tram line opened between Luxexpo and the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge serving the Kirchberg quarter. An extension to the city centre (St\u00e4replaz-\u00c9toile) was opened on 27 July 2018. Further extensions to Luxembourg station, Bonnevoie, Howald, and Cloche d\u2019Or are due to be completed by 2020/21.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLuxembourg City is served by the only international airport in the country: Luxembourg Airport (codes: IATA: LUX, ICAO: ELLX). Accessibility to the airport, situated in the commune of Sandweiler, 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from the city centre, is provided via the municipal bus network, with a tram connection due to be completed by 2021. The airport is the principal hub for Luxembourg's flag carrier, Luxair, and one of the world's largest cargo airlines, Cargolux.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLuxembourg is a member of the QuattroPole union of cities, along with Trier, Saarbr\u00fccken, and Metz (neighbouring countries: Germany and France).\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\nLuxembourg is twinned with:\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mayors of Luxembourg City\nCessange\nEurovision Song Contest 1962, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1966, held at the Villa Louvigny\nEurovision Song Contest 1973, held at the  Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\nEurovision Song Contest 1984, held in the Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of Luxembourg City\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMakos, Adam (2019).

          "Like other reviewers have said, this is indeed a very informative museum. By far the best museum I visited during my stay in Luxembourg. The exhibitions are very well thought and there are some interactive parts too. Kids will most likely enjoy a visit there too.",
          "For five Euros, you can learn about Luxembourg's history from the medieval period to modern time. You start off from the lowest basement and move your way up. I was amazed to learn that there are so many nationalities represented in this tiny country. There are a few",
          "Eventhough I consider myself as quite knowledgable of the history of Luxembourg and its capital city (as a citizen), this visit has been more then perfect to gain some better historical overview. We had a tour with a Luxembourgish guide explaining all details of the first",
          "In our trip to Luxembourg we decided to learn more about the history of the country and its capital. The museum is very informative and the history well presented. They have also special exhibitions, e.g. Luxembourg street photography. You also can enjoy the view on the city",
          "This is the place which will inform you about the Luxembourg past in a very interesting way. We took there our small kids (5y&7y) and they weren't bored. The place is filled with interesting artefacts and there is always a chance of viewing special/temporary exhibitions. We have",
          "This place gives you an informative insight into the history of Luxembourg. It is spread out over 5 floors and is nicely laid out. It was priced at 5 Euro\u2019s each so good value for money too. Well worth a visit.",
          "We had no idea about the history of Luxembourg but always like to know something of the background to the places we visit so this was very worthwhile doing. The museum building is of a very innovative design and the exhibits and information were very well presented and told us",
          "A striking concrete box on the outside, really standing out from the rest of the old town, this is a well arranged, interesting and varied exhibition. As with most museums in Luxembourg, the signs are in French and German only - and that\u2019s fair enough - so if you don\u2019t speak",
          "This museum is in a really cool building and it has the largest museum lift I have ever seen - a panoramic one. But the collection isn\u2019t worth much.",
          "This museum and more importantly the building that hosts the exhibits is fascinating. The way it is laid out and the story presented makes the visit really pleasant and informative. I do not see why this is not the No1 attraction in the city. If you don\u2019t visit this you will",
          "If you are here to do Luxembourg history, then this is a must do. I particularly liked the mini cyclorama style view of the city streets. I went back to it several times to view again.",

          "We did the 4pm English tour on a Sunday and thought the tour guide was amazing! She let us know so many interesting facts and really opened our eyes to the history of Luxembourg. She had so much knowledge really made our tour around the museum enjoyable! Big thumbs up!",
          "As with so many of the other attractions in Luxembourg city, this museum is housed in a stunning building where all the space is utilised to its best advantage. The exhibits trace the history of the city from its early beginnings, through all the turmoil of its past, to its",
          "Hell-O everyone Visiting a museum in Luxembourg yesterday gave us to discover few things of national heritage. 5 floors down of the ground and few up. Beginning of humans then all evaluation of our existing hihi.. sorry for my humour. It's free of charge and worth to spend",
          "As others have reported, this museum did an excellent job of explaining in graphic and clear ways the history of Luxembourg city. It was very modern and you could see that Luxembourg spent time and effort on making this a great museum.",
          "First, the entry is on the 3rd floor, we came in on the first and security was nice enough to get us to the entrance. Great English translations on all exhibits helped us decipher what we saw at other museums. Ditto on that room size elevator that was mentioned on another",
          "I was only in Luxembourg for a day, so this museum gave a great overview of the history and culture of the area. It was also really cheap for visitors in their 20s!",
          "This is a must go-to museum if one is interested in the development of the city since the 7th century. It's very well done with several large wooden models that make it easy to see the expansion of the city over the many centuries. It has also many other displays of artefacts,",

          "The variety of delights inside was surprising Even the largest lift we have ever stepped into, was a delight in itself There was more to see than I had expected and it began to justify the \u20ac5 entrance fee And then we were warned the museum was closing in 15mins So with a",
          "The lift was the best part of the museum/Luxembourg/my life so far. Permanently changed the game for lift enthusiasts. Truly next level.",
          "We got lost exploring Luxembourg in this marvellous museum. Something to everyone\u2018s taste can be found here. Foreign languages provided: German, English, French. The only little drawback was that there was no possibility to listen to listen to contemporary witnesses in a",
          "Cashier was not friendly but the guards were even unfriendly. They have items presented which seem to be interactive, for example a turnable boat steering wheel in the middle of the visitor path, but they rudely react when kids touch them. Put a sign there. Presented material is",
          "The building of the museum itself is very interesting but don\u2019t count on having phone signal inside. The museum has several wooden models of what the city looked like at different stages of development. They also show a collection of objects in regards to the life of every day",
          "Fascinating insight into the history and people of Luxembourg. Very well set out and organised museum with a very large amazing lift to transport you to different floors.",
          "First, the building is a stunning design. It's worth going just to see the panoramic lift (elevator). Of particular interest is the exhibition illustrating the history of Luxembourg. As I did not know much about luxembourg I found it fascinating.",
          "Very nice combination of technology and original items. Important to better understand the current layout of the city. You feel like you are walking through history. Free with the Luxembourg City Card. It was a really nice surprise.",
          "This museum provides a colourful insight into the history of Luxembourg, with lots of displays, interactive exhibits and models which bring it to life. There is however quite a lot of reading, therefore I wouldn't recommend it for or with young children. Entrance was \u20ac5 for",

          "Luxembourg City History Museum is a look at the history of Luxembourg City. It opens at 10:00 and gets busier later in the day, so earlier is better. There are interesting exhibits on the history of the city. I think you can get thru it in an hour or so. If facing the Palais",
          "I think this has to be the best indoor site in Luxembourg. Tremendously informative and a great way to learn the complex, interesting history of the country, and it was at a reasonable price. It's a must see in Lux City in my book.",
          "Well designed information about the history of Luxembourg City. Good location and modest pricing. Worth the visit.",
          "This former city palace has been repurposed into a thoughtful and well-done City history museum. You cannot visit Luxembourg without coming here and learning about their very varied history.",
          "A well-designed and fascinating museum. Gives a real insight into the history and making of modern Luxembourg and its role in Europe. That probably sounds boring but it is done really well. And - as one reviewer said - what a beautiful elevator - worth the admission alone!",
          "We visited this museum with our Luxembourg card so entrance was free. Our children were fascinated by the different artefacts whilst my husband and I were keen to learn about the history of the city and the way it's governed. It was relatively interactive and very clean",
          "We came here on our last day to kill some time but we had a fun time. The main exhibition tells you about the history of luxembourgh, how it came to be and how it evolved through time. You will find a lot of documents and items related to war and sketches showing you luxembourgh",
          "The Musee d'Histoire de la Ville is set up to be informative to a local person as opposed to a out-of-country tourist. It is quite interactive.",
          "We wish we'd had more time here. The museum offers a fascinating overview of years of Luxembourg's history. The dioramas were a particularly clever way to show how the site has grown over time. The museum is layered over a number of floors but lockers are available (coin",
          "Not enough can be said to praise this well-curated, expertly-designed museum. Not having any foreknowledge of this city, the museum story telling has made a now, somewhat, expert. The story of the Nazi occupation and subsequent liberation by the Americans is quite sobering.",
          "Sparse, disjointed, confusing museum with closed panoramic terrace and 2 entire floors (out of 5) completely empty. I did like the massive elevator -an entire glass room that moved up and down. In the basement there's an exit to Le Chemin de la Corniche, but it's hard to use it",

          "It's a good museum and you get an idea about Luxembourg city. The only thing they have no seats inside the rooms so after a while you get really tired standing up. No cafe either.",
          "This was definitely the best museum I visited during my three days in Luxembourg. It is organised over three floors and makes great use of beautiful dioramas of the city to detail how the city has changed over time and to bring to life key events in the city's history. I had not",
          "For \u20ac5 you get 4 floors of history showing Luxembourg's progression from an abbey to military garrison to industrial city to international finance. There are models of the city at various stages, advertisements in Luxembourgish, and a collection of stereoscopic photos from the",

          "We took our time in here and learned a lot about the country. Starting from ancient times and going all the way through the Nazi occupation during World War II, there was a lot to see and read, but it was worth it!",
          "Limited exhibits as the museum had a special show about football. Central location near centre, so easy to find.",
          "The museum is under renovation and so the only exhibit open is the football one which tbh is such a crying shame. Hopefully it will be completed soon so people can enjoy it.",
          "I got to visit this museum which is currently undergoing a major renovation. The only exhibit I could see was called \"Football Hallelujah\" (Soccer) about the obsession with soccer. I'm not really into sports so this was kind of boring for me personally. I could see however that",
          "Well worth a visit if you get the time on your visit to Luxembourg. We had an enjoyable few hours wandering around. Would highly recommend spending the time out to visit.",
          "We went for a free guided tour (it is offered from time to time) and it couldn't be better. Explanations were full of reasoning and fantastically telling. We liked everything from it, the content, the exposed pieces, the charts, the building.",

          "This is a pleasant museum and is included in the Luxembourg card so is worth a visit. Unfortunately, you can not gain access to any of the main exhibits about the city's history for the next six months at the moment due to renovation and we were not aware of this until we",
          "This museum has FREE entrance every Thursday from 6:00 pm. Because of this, I was only allowed into 'Football Hallelujah' exhibit (which will be on until March 2017) rather than other permanent exhibitions of the museum. Nonetheless, the exhibition was interesting and",

          "Fascinating building, cool glass elevator is a must!. Lots of nooks and crannies throughout made the flow of the building alittle difficult to understand and followat times. That being said, the historical presentations were excellent and I learned a lot about the city and its",

          "It's hard to keep track of the history of Luxembourg as a country - but they do a good job here. Displays of the growth of the city and artwork are interesting. Take time to read about the exhibits as you walk through. I enjoyed the newsreels (movies) of historical events.",
          "There are two entries under the history of the city, one (this one ) with the French name (shown at the entrance of the museum) the other is the English translation. This museum is definitely the history of the city, depiction of its physical development, extending into the",

          "This is a Fascinating place if you like history and pictures. The building is big. (If i'm not wrong 7 or 8 floors). In my opinion the best part of it it is on \"-2 floor\" pre-historical life style. You feel as if you've been at that moment. Really good.",
          "What a great museum for local history! And the architecture of the museum is as much part of the local history. Museum is not overly crowded which permits the opportunity and time to read placards and study artifacts and displays. The museum was easy to navigate and front desk",

          "This isn't the best museum I've been into. I found it a little sparse and not that much that interested me I'm afraid.",
          "It's not a huge museum but it's pleasant enough and gives some insight into the history which was interesting. At only 5 euros entrance fee per adult it's good value. It takes about 1.5 hours at a leisurely pace to cover it. Descriptions are in German, French and English",
          "This is probably one of the poorest museum visits I've had. When we visited two floors of the museum were closed, which no doubt didn't help! The staff were quite unhelpful - the three gentlemen behing the desk were chatting for three minutes before they deigned to engage with",
          "I would have wanted more on the Royal, political history... Small and compact... There was the funniest video of champagne making that I thought was a gag but it wasn't!",

          "Whether you're a weekend tourist or a long-term ex-pat resident, this is an excellent way to learn about the city's history. Highly recommended. And if you are interested in what can be done to maximize viewing space in a challenging physical location - not to mention",
          "This museum was a very pleasant surprise - offering thorough insights into not only the city's history but that of the whole country. I had planned to visit the national history museum but found the city museum superior by comparison, and with more visitor-friendly opening times.",
          "This is a fun little museum not only for the history of the City, but to see the creative architecture of the museum itself. The museum is comprised of 4 ancient buildings brought together with modern architecture. You see the stone walls, arches, and features through glass",
          "An excellent and intelligent city museum, which has a good overview of Luxembourg's history, but also has rooms oriented around interesting themes (state and power, media, industry) which offer insights into how the city-state has evolved. The only 'attraction' in the city worth",

          "Knowing very little about Luxembourg history, I figured this would be a good place to visit and it was. We learned a lot. Even better, architecturally it is beautiful- a mix of old buildings and new modern structural elements added in. The elevator was really cool and I like how",

          "If there is only one museum you will visit in Luxembourg - this should be your choice. The entry to the museum is on the courtyard of the old building separated by a glass fa\u00e7ade. You start your journey by entering a small room with a wooden floor that slowly starts to fall",

        "wiki": "The Place d'Armes (Luxembourgish: Pl\u00ebss d'Arem, or simply Pl\u00ebss) is a square in Luxembourg City in the south of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Centrally placed in the old town, it attracts large numbers of locals and visitors, especially in the summer months. It originally served as a parade ground for the troops defending the city.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter a huge fire in 1554 destroyed a large part of the Ville Haute, plans were made to lay out a square in the centre of the fortified town. The task was assigned to the Dutch military engineer Sebastian van Noyen who designed the first version of the square, then known as the Neumarkt, or New Market. In 1671, the Spanish engineer Jean Charles de Landas, Count of Louvigny, produced a slightly smaller square at the same location. It became known as the Place d'Armes as it was used as a parade ground for the garrison. Under Louis XIV, it was paved with flagstones and bordered with lime trees.\n\n\n== The Place d'Armes today ==\n\nNow an integral part of the pedestrian zone, the square is surrounded by numerous caf\u00e9s and restaurants, all with pavement terraces in the summer months. It has become the city's main centre of activity, attracting locals and visitors of all ages. Visiting bands and music groups present concerts from the central bandstand every summer evening. Every second and fourth Saturday, there is a flea market and in December the square houses the Christmas market.\n\n\n== Cercle Municipal ==\nThe Palais Municipal or Cercle as it is generally known stands at the eastern end of the square. It was originally designed as an administrative building with reception rooms. The main structure was completed in 1906 but work on the interior took until 1909.\nOn the facade, there is a sculpture by Luxembourg artist P. Federspiel of Countess Ermisinde granting the Charter of Emancipation in 1244 which guaranteed the citizens rights and duties towards the nobility.  \n\nAfter a period when it was used for the European Court of Justice the Palais Municipal has, since 1969, served as a venue for celebrations and cultural events.A plaque on the Cercle Municipal records the liberation of Luxembourg during the Second World War. It reads: \n\nOn this square, on 10 September 1944 the people of Luxembourg warmly welcomed its liberators, the valiant soldiers of the US 5th Armored Division and their royal highnesses Prince Felix of Luxembourg and Prince John hereditary grand duke of Luxembourg.\n\n\n== Dicks-Lentz monument ==\nAt the western end of the Place d'Armes on Square Jan Pallach, there is monument by Pierre Federspiel celebrating Luxembourg's two national poets Dicks (1823\u20131891) and Michel Lentz (1820\u20131893), who wrote the words of the national anthem. The lion at the top of the monument represents the Grand Duchy, while the blacksmith symbolizes the steel industry. The inscription on the pillar: Mir w\u00eblle bleiwe wat mir sin (We want to stay what we are) is the motto of the Luxembourgers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPlace Guillaume II\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "We were a bit fooled by the fact that only the medieval part is included in the entry ticket. Don't be mistaken: the castle IS nice, but it is a short visit for the price... therefor just an 'average' mark here... The renaissance part (which looks much nicer) can be visited with",

          "A very pretty stroll, but do use the lift on the way back up to save the walk. Also pick your time to go. We went when there was an outdoor art exhibition on the bridge, whisch added to the feel of the place. However a Sunday morning is a bit dead and was much better come",
          "The view from the top was pretty. We saw a river, an ongoing concert, several bars and the layout of the place. We started from the top and did not know how to go down. We did not see any elevator so we just followed any of the stairs that go down to the concert. It was a",
          "It is a long but rewarding walk from the old town, down the side of the cliff, to get to this quaint part of the city. Quiet streets, a slow moving river, great views, and a few interesting attractions. Once down here take a walk along the path through the park that stretches",

          "If \"Le Chemin de la Corniche\" gives you a great view from the top of the hills, the \"Barrio Grund\" or just \"Grund\" as it is called in Luxembourg, gives you fantastic views from the bottom to top. I would say that the landscape is even more picturesque from the bottom. The area",

        "wiki": "A fountain (from the Latin \"fons\" (genitive \"fontis\"), a source or spring) is a piece of architecture which pours water into a basin or jets it into the air to supply drinking water and/or for a decorative or dramatic effect.\nFountains were originally purely functional, connected to springs or aqueducts and used to provide drinking water and water for bathing and washing to the residents of cities, towns and villages. Until the late 19th century most fountains operated by gravity, and needed a source of water higher than the fountain, such as a reservoir or aqueduct, to make the water flow or jet into the air.\nIn addition to providing drinking water, fountains were used for decoration and to celebrate their builders. Roman fountains were decorated with bronze or stone masks of animals or heroes. In the Middle Ages, Moorish and Muslim garden designers used fountains to create miniature versions of the gardens of paradise. King Louis XIV of France used fountains in the Gardens of Versailles to illustrate his power over nature. The baroque decorative fountains of Rome in the 17th and 18th centuries marked the arrival point of restored Roman aqueducts and glorified the Popes who built them.By the end of the 19th century, as indoor plumbing became the main source of drinking water, urban fountains became purely decorative. Mechanical pumps replaced gravity and allowed fountains to recycle water and to force it high into the air. The Jet d'Eau in Lake Geneva, built in 1951, shoots water 140 metres (460 ft) in the air. The highest such fountain in the world is King Fahd's Fountain in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which spouts water 260 metres (850 ft) above the Red Sea.Fountains are used today to decorate city parks and squares; to honor individuals or events; for recreation and for entertainment. A Splash pad or spray pool allows city residents to enter, get wet and cool off in summer. The musical fountain combines moving jets of water, colored lights and recorded music, controlled by a computer, for dramatic effects.  Fountains can themselves also be musical instruments played by obstruction of one or more of their water jets.\nDrinking fountains provide clean drinking water in public buildings, parks and public spaces.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient fountains ===\n \nAncient civilizations built stone basins to capture and hold precious drinking water. A carved stone basin, dating to around 2000 BC, was discovered in the ruins of the ancient Sumerian city of Lagash in modern Iraq. The ancient Assyrians constructed a series of basins in the gorge of the Comel River, carved in solid rock, connected by small channels, descending to a stream. The lowest basin was decorated with carved reliefs of two lions.  The ancient Egyptians had ingenious systems for hoisting water up from the Nile for drinking and irrigation, but without a higher source of water it was not possible to make water flow by gravity, and no Egyptian fountains or pictures of fountains have been found.\nThe ancient Greeks used aqueducts and gravity-powered fountains to distribute water. According to ancient historians, fountains existed in Athens, Corinth, and other ancient Greek cities in the 6th century BC as the terminating points of aqueducts which brought water from springs and rivers into the cities. In the 6th century BC, the Athenian ruler Peisistratos built the main fountain of Athens, the Enneacrounos, in the Agora, or main square. It had nine large cannons, or spouts, which supplied drinking water to local residents.Greek fountains were made of stone or marble, with water flowing through bronze pipes and emerging from the mouth of a sculpted mask that represented the head of a lion or the muzzle of an animal. Most Greek fountains flowed by simple gravity, but they also discovered how to use principle of a siphon to make water spout, as seen in pictures on Greek vases.\n\n\n=== Ancient Roman fountains ===\n\nThe Ancient Romans built an extensive system of aqueducts from mountain rivers and lakes to provide water for the fountains and baths of Rome. The Roman engineers used lead pipes instead of bronze to distribute the water throughout the city. The excavations at Pompeii, which revealed the city as it was when it was destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, uncovered free-standing fountains and basins placed at intervals along city streets, fed by siphoning water upwards from lead pipes under the street. The excavations of Pompeii also showed that the homes of wealthy Romans often had a small fountain in the atrium, or interior courtyard, with water coming from the city water supply and spouting into a small bowl or basin.\nAncient Rome was a city of fountains. According to Sextus Julius Frontinus, the Roman consul who was named curator aquarum or guardian of the water of Rome in 98 AD, Rome had nine aqueducts which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.The Romans were able to make fountains jet water into the air, by using the pressure of water flowing from a distant and higher source of water to create hydraulic head, or force. Illustrations of fountains in gardens spouting water are found on wall paintings in Rome from the 1st century BC, and in the villas of Pompeii.  The Villa of Hadrian in Tivoli featured a large swimming basin with jets of water. Pliny the Younger described the banquet room of a Roman villa where a fountain began to jet water when visitors sat on a marble seat. The water flowed into a basin, where the courses of a banquet were served in floating dishes shaped like boats.Roman engineers built aqueducts and fountains throughout the Roman Empire. Examples can be found today in the ruins of Roman towns in Vaison-la-Romaine and Glanum in France, in Augst, Switzerland, and other sites.\n\n\n=== Medieval fountains ===\n\nIn Nepal there were public drinking fountains at least as early as 550 AD. They are called dhunge dharas or hitis. They consist of intricately carved stone spouts through which water flows uninterrupted from underground water sources. They are found extensively in Nepal and some of them are still operational. Construction of water conduits like hitis and dug wells are considered as pious acts in Nepal.During the Middle Ages, Roman aqueducts were wrecked or fell into decay, and many fountains throughout Europe stopped working, so fountains existed mainly in art and literature, or in secluded monasteries or palace gardens. Fountains in the Middle Ages were associated with the source of life, purity, wisdom, innocence, and the Garden of Eden. In illuminated manuscripts like the Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry (1411\u20131416), the Garden of Eden was shown with a graceful gothic fountain in the center (see illustration). The Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck, finished in 1432, also shows a fountain as a feature of the adoration of the mystic lamb, a scene apparently set in Paradise.\nThe cloister of a monastery was supposed to be a replica of the Garden of Eden, protected from the outside world. Simple fountains, called lavabos, were placed inside Medieval monasteries such as Le Thoronet Abbey in Provence and were used for ritual washing before religious services.Fountains were also found in the enclosed medieval jardins d'amour, \"gardens of courtly love\" \u2013 ornamental gardens used for courtship and relaxation. The medieval romance The Roman de la Rose describes a fountain in the center of an enclosed garden, feeding small streams bordered by flowers and fresh herbs.\nSome Medieval fountains, like the cathedrals of their time, illustrated biblical stories, local history and the virtues of their time. The Fontana Maggiore in Perugia, dedicated in 1278, is decorated with stone carvings representing prophets and saints, allegories of the arts, labors of the months, the signs of the zodiac, and scenes from Genesis and Roman history.Medieval fountains could also provide amusement. The gardens of the Counts of Artois at the Ch\u00e2teau de Hesdin, built in 1295, contained famous fountains, called Les Merveilles de Hesdin (\"The Wonders of Hesdin\") which could be triggered to drench surprised visitors.\n\n\n=== Fountains of the Islamic World ===\n\nShortly after the spread of Islam, the Arabs incorporated into their city planning the Persian designs of the famous Islamic gardens. Islamic gardens after the 7th century were traditionally enclosed by walls and were designed to represent paradise. The paradise gardens, were laid out in the form of a cross, with four channels representing the rivers of paradise, dividing the four parts of the world.  Water sometimes spouted from a fountain in the center of the cross, representing the spring or fountain, Salsabil, described in the Qur'an as the source of the rivers of Paradise.In the 9th century, the Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 brothers, a trio of Persian Inventors, were commissioned by the Caliph of Baghdad to summarize the engineering knowledge of the ancient Greek and Roman world. They wrote a book entitled the Book of Ingenious Devices, describing the works of the 1st century Greek Engineer Hero of Alexandria and other engineers, plus many of their own inventions. They described fountains which formed water into different shapes and a wind-powered water pump, but it is not known if any of their fountains were ever actually built.The Persian rulers of the Middle Ages had elaborate water distribution systems and fountains in their palaces and gardens. Water was carried by a pipe into the palace from a source at a higher elevation. Once inside the palace or garden it came up through a small hole in a marble or stone ornament and poured into a basin or garden channels. The gardens of Pasargades had a system of canals which flowed from basin to basin, both watering the garden and making a pleasant sound. The Persian engineers also used the principle of the syphon (called shotor-gelu in Persian, literally 'neck of the camel) to create fountains which spouted water or made it resemble a bubbling spring. The garden of Fin, near Kashan, used 171 spouts connected to pipes to create a fountain called the Howz-e jush, or \"boiling basin\".The 11th century Persian poet Azraqi described a Persian fountain:\n\nFrom a marvelous faucet of gold pours a wave\nwhose clarity is more pure than a soul;\nThe turquoise and silver form ribbons in the basin\ncoming from this faucet of gold ...Reciprocating motion was first described in 1206 by Iraqi engineer and inventor al-Jazari when the kings of the Artuqid dynasty in Turkey commissioned him to manufacture a machine to raise water for their palaces. The finest result was a machine called the double-acting reciprocating piston pump, which translated rotary motion to reciprocating motion via the crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism.The palaces of Moorish Spain, particularly the Alhambra in Granada, had famous fountains. The patio of the Sultan in the gardens of Generalife in Granada (1319) featured spouts of water pouring into a basin, with channels which irrigated orange and myrtle trees. The garden was modified over the centuries \u2013 the jets of water which cross the canal today were added in the 19th century.\nThe fountain in the Court of the Lions of the Alhambra, built from 1362 to 1391, is a large vasque mounted on twelve stone statues of lions. Water spouts upward in the vasque and pours from the mouths of the lions, filling four channels dividing the courtyard into quadrants.  The basin dates to the 14th century, but the lions spouting water are believed to be older, dating to the 11th century.The design of the Islamic garden spread throughout the Islamic world, from Moorish Spain to the Mughal Empire in the Indian subcontinent. The Shalimar Gardens built by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1641, were said to be ornamented with 410 fountains, which fed into a large basin, canal and marble pools.\nIn the Ottoman Empire, rulers often built fountains next to mosques so worshippers could do their ritual washing. Examples include the Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527), Temple Mount, Jerusalem, an ablution and drinking fountain built during the Ottoman reign of Suleiman the Magnificent; the Fountain of Ahmed III (1728) at the Topkap\u0131 Palace, Istanbul, another Fountain of Ahmed III in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar (1729) and Tophane Fountain (1732). Palaces themselves often had small decorated fountains, which provided drinking water, cooled the air, and made a pleasant splashing sound. One surviving example is the Fountain of Tears (1764) at the Bakhchisarai Palace, in Crimea; which was made famous by a poem of Alexander Pushkin.\nThe sebil was a decorated fountain that was often the only source of water for the surrounding neighborhood.\nIt was often commissioned as an act of Islamic piety by a rich person.\n\n\n=== Renaissance fountains (15th\u201317th centuries) ===\n\nIn the 14th century, Italian humanist scholars began to rediscover and translate forgotten Roman texts on architecture by Vitruvius, on hydraulics by Hero of Alexandria, and descriptions of Roman gardens and fountains by Pliny the Younger, Pliny the Elder, and Varro. The treatise on architecture, De re aedificatoria, by Leon Battista Alberti, which described in detail Roman villas, gardens and fountains, became the guidebook for Renaissance builders.In Rome, Pope Nicholas V (1397\u20131455), himself a scholar who commissioned hundreds of translations of ancient Greek classics into Latin, decided to embellish the city and make it a worthy capital of the Christian world. In 1453, he began to rebuild the Acqua Vergine, the ruined Roman aqueduct which had brought clean drinking water to the city from eight miles (13 km) away. He also decided to revive the Roman custom of marking the arrival point of an aqueduct with a mostra, a grand commemorative fountain. He commissioned the architect Leon Battista Alberti to build a wall fountain where the Trevi Fountain is now located. The aqueduct he restored, with modifications and extensions, eventually supplied water to the Trevi Fountain and the famous baroque fountains in the Piazza del Popolo and Piazza Navona.One of the first new fountains to be built in Rome during the Renaissance was the fountain in the piazza in front of the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere (1472), which was placed on the site of an earlier Roman fountain. Its design, based on an earlier Roman model, with a circular vasque on a pedestal pouring water into a basin below, became the model for many other fountains in Rome, and eventually for fountains in other cities, from Paris to London.In 1503, Pope Julius II decided to recreate a classical pleasure garden in the same place. The new garden, called the Cortile del Belvedere, was designed by Donato Bramante. The garden was decorated with the Pope's famous collection of classical statues, and with fountains. The Venetian Ambassador wrote in 1523, \"... On one side of the garden is a most beautiful loggia, at one end of which is a lovely fountain that irrigates the orange trees and the rest of the garden by a little canal in the center of the loggia ...  The original garden was split in two by the construction of the Vatican Library in the 16th century, but a new fountain by Carlo Maderno was built in the Cortile del Belvedere, with a jet of water shooting up from a circular stone bowl on an octagonal pedestal in a large basin.In 1537, in Florence, Cosimo I de' Medici, who had become ruler of the city at the age of only 17, also decided to launch a program of aqueduct and fountain building. The city had previously gotten all its drinking water from wells and reservoirs of rain water, which meant that there was little water or water pressure to run fountains. Cosimo built an aqueduct large enough for the first continually-running fountain in Florence, the Fountain of Neptune in the Piazza della Signoria (1560\u20131567). This fountain featured an enormous white marble statue of Neptune, resembling Cosimo, by sculptor Bartolomeo Ammannati.Under the Medicis, fountains were not just sources of water, but advertisements of the power and benevolence of the city's rulers. They became central elements not only of city squares, but of the new Italian Renaissance garden. The great Medici Villa at Castello, built for Cosimo by Benedetto Varchi, featured two monumental fountains on its central axis; one showing with two bronze figures representing Hercules slaying Antaeus, symbolizing the victory of Cosimo over his enemies; and a second fountain, in the middle of a circular labyrinth of cypresses, laurel, myrtle and roses, had a bronze statue by Giambologna which showed the goddess Venus wringing her hair. The planet Venus was governed by Capricorn, which was the emblem of Cosimo; the fountain symbolized that he was the absolute master of Florence.By the middle Renaissance, fountains had become a form of theater, with cascades and jets of water coming from marble statues of animals and mythological figures. The most famous fountains of this kind were found in the Villa d'Este (1550\u20131572), at Tivoli near Rome, which featured a hillside of basins, fountains and jets of water, as well as a fountain which produced music by pouring water into a chamber, forcing air into a series of flute-like pipes. The gardens also featured giochi d'acqua, water jokes, hidden fountains which suddenly soaked visitors.\nBetween 1546 and 1549, the merchants of Paris built the first Renaissance-style fountain in Paris, the Fontaine des Innocents, to commemorate the ceremonial entry of the King into the city. The fountain, which originally stood against the wall of the church of the Holy Innocents, as rebuilt several times and now stands in a square near Les Halles. It is the oldest fountain in Paris.Henry constructed an Italian-style garden with a fountain shooting a vertical jet of water for his favorite mistress, Diane de Poitiers, next to the Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau (1556\u20131559). At the royal Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau, he built another fountain with a bronze statue of Diane, goddess of the hunt, modeled after Diane de Poitiers.Later, after the death of Henry II, his widow, Catherine de Medici, expelled Diane de Poitiers from Chenonceau and built her own fountain and garden there.\nKing Henry IV of France made an important contribution to French fountains by inviting an Italian hydraulic engineer, Tommaso Francini, who had worked on the fountains of the villa at Pratalino, to make fountains in France. Francini became a French citizen in 1600, built the Medici Fountain, and during the rule of the young King Louis XIII, he was raised to the position of Intendant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Eaux et Fontaines of the king, a position which was hereditary. His descendants became the royal fountain designers for Louis XIII and for Louis XIV at Versailles.In 1630, another Medici, Marie de Medici, the widow of Henry IV, built her own monumental fountain in Paris, the Medici Fountain, in the garden of the Palais du Luxembourg. That fountain still exists today, with a long basin of water and statues added in 1866.\n\n\n=== Baroque fountains (17th\u201318th century) ===\n\n\n==== Baroque Fountains of Rome ====\n\nThe 17th and 18th centuries were a golden age for fountains in Rome, which began with the reconstruction of ruined Roman aqueducts and the construction by the Popes of mostra, or display fountains, to mark their termini. The new fountains were expressions of the new Baroque art, which was officially promoted by the Catholic Church as a way to win popular support against the Protestant Reformation; the Council of Trent had declared in the 16th century that the Church should counter austere Protestantism with art that was lavish, animated and emotional. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of Rubens, were examples of the principles of Baroque art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were \"a visual representation of confidence and power.\"The first of the Fountains of St. Peter's Square, by Carlo Maderno, (1614) was one of the earliest Baroque fountains in Rome, made to complement the lavish Baroque fa\u00e7ade he designed for St. Peter's Basilica behind it. It was fed by water from the Paola aqueduct, restored in 1612, whose source was 266 feet (81 m) above sea level, which meant it could shoot water twenty feet up from the fountain. Its form, with a large circular vasque on a pedestal pouring water into a basin and an inverted vasque above it spouting water, was imitated two centuries later in the Fountains of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\nThe Triton Fountain in the Piazza Barberini (1642), by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, is a masterpiece of Baroque sculpture, representing Triton, half-man and half-fish, blowing his horn to calm the waters, following a text by the Roman poet Ovid in the Metamorphoses. The Triton fountain benefited from its location in a valley, and the fact that it was fed by the Aqua Felice aqueduct, restored in 1587, which arrived in Rome at an elevation of 194 feet (59 m) above sea level (fasl), a difference of 130 feet (40 m) in elevation between the source and the fountain, which meant that the water from this fountain jetted sixteen feet straight up into the air from the conch shell of the triton.The Piazza Navona became a grand theater of water, with three fountains, built in a line on the site of the Stadium of Domitian. The fountains at either end are by Giacomo della Porta; the Neptune fountain to the north, (1572) shows the God of the Sea spearing an octopus, surrounded by tritons, sea horses and mermaids. At the southern end is Il Moro, possibly also a figure of Neptune riding a fish in a conch shell. In the center is the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, (The Fountain of the Four Rivers) (1648\u201351), a highly theatrical fountain by Bernini, with statues representing rivers from the four continents; the Nile, Danube, Plate River and Ganges. Over the whole structure is a 54-foot (16 m) Egyptian obelisk, crowned by a cross with the emblem of the Pamphili family, representing Pope Innocent X, whose family palace was on the piazza. The theme of a fountain with statues symbolizing great rivers was later used in the Place de la Concorde (1836\u201340) and in the Fountain of Neptune in the Alexanderplatz in Berlin (1891). The fountains of Piazza Navona had one drawback - their water came from the Acqua Vergine, which had only a 23-foot (7.0 m) drop from the source to the fountains, which meant the water could only fall or trickle downwards, not jet very high upwards.The Trevi Fountain is the largest and most spectacular of Rome's fountains, designed to glorify the three different Popes who created it. It was built beginning in 1730 at the terminus of the reconstructed Acqua Vergine aqueduct, on the site of Renaissance fountain by Leon Battista Alberti. It was the work of architect Nicola Salvi and the successive project of Pope Clement XII, Pope Benedict XIV and Pope Clement XIII, whose emblems and inscriptions are carried on the attic story, entablature and central niche. The central figure is Oceanus, the personification of all the seas and oceans, in an oyster-shell chariot, surrounded by Tritons and Sea Nymphs.\nIn fact, the fountain had very little water pressure, because the source of water was, like the source for the Piazza Navona fountains, the Acqua Vergine, with a 23-foot (7.0 m) drop. Salvi compensated for this problem by sinking the fountain down into the ground, and by carefully designing the cascade so that the water churned and tumbled, to add movement and drama.  Wrote historians Maria Ann Conelli and Marilyn Symmes, \"On many levels the Trevi altered the appearance, function and intent of fountains and was a watershed for future designs.\"\n\n\n=== Baroque fountains of Rome ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Baroque fountains of Versailles ====\nBeginning in 1662, King Louis XIV of France began to build a new kind of garden, the Garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, or French formal garden, at the Palace of Versailles. In this garden, the fountain played a central role. He used fountains to demonstrate the power of man over nature, and to illustrate the grandeur of his rule. In the Gardens of Versailles, instead of falling naturally into a basin, water was shot into the sky, or formed into the shape of a fan or bouquet. Dancing water was combined with music and fireworks to form a grand spectacle. These fountains were the work of the descendants of Tommaso Francini, the Italian hydraulic engineer who had come to France during the time of Henry IV and built the Medici Fountain and the Fountain of Diana at Fontainebleau.\nTwo fountains were the centerpieces of the Gardens of Versailles, both taken from the myths about Apollo, the sun god, the emblem of Louis XIV, and both symbolizing his power. The Fontaine Latone (1668\u201370) designed by Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre and sculpted by Gaspard and Balthazar Marsy, represents the story of how the peasants of Lycia tormented Latona and her children, Diana and Apollo, and were punished by being turned into frogs. This was a reminder of how French peasants had abused Louis's mother, Anne of Austria, during the uprising called the Fronde in the 1650s. When the fountain is turned on, sprays of water pour down on the peasants, who are frenzied as they are transformed into creatures.The other centerpiece of the Gardens, at the intersection of the main axes of the Gardens of Versailles, is the Bassin d'Apollon (1668\u201371), designed by Charles Le Brun and sculpted by Jean Baptiste Tuby. This statue shows a theme also depicted in the painted decoration in the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles: Apollo in his chariot about to rise from the water, announced by Tritons with seashell trumpets. Historians Mary Anne Conelli and Marilyn Symmes wrote, \"Designed for dramatic effect and to flatter the king, the fountain is oriented so that the Sun God rises from the west and travels east toward the chateau, in contradiction to nature.\"Besides these two monumental fountains, the Gardens over the years contained dozens of other fountains, including thirty-nine animal fountains in the labyrinth depicting the fables of Jean de La Fontaine.\nThere were so many fountains at Versailles that it was impossible to have them all running at once; when Louis XIV made his promenades, his fountain-tenders turned on the fountains ahead of him and turned off those behind him. Louis built an enormous pumping station, the Machine de Marly, with fourteen water wheels and 253 pumps to raise the water three hundred feet from the River Seine, and even attempted to divert the River Eure to provide water for his fountains, but the water supply was never enough.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Baroque fountains of Peterhof ====\nIn Russia, Peter the Great founded a new capital at St. Petersburg in 1703 and built a small Summer Palace and gardens there beside the Neva River. The gardens featured a fountain of two sea monsters spouting water, among the earliest fountains in Russia.\nIn 1709, he began constructing a larger palace, Peterhof Palace, alongside the Gulf of Finland, Peter visited France in 1717 and saw the gardens and fountains of Louis XIV at Versailles, Marly and Fontainebleau. When he returned he began building a vast Garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise with fountains at Peterhof. The central feature of the garden was a water cascade, modeled after the cascade at the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly of Louis XIV, built in 1684. The gardens included trick fountains designed to drench unsuspecting visitors, a popular feature of the Italian Renaissance garden.,In 1800\u20131802 the Emperor Paul I of Russia and his successor, Alexander I of Russia, built a new fountain at the foot of the cascade depicting Samson prying open the mouth of a lion, representing Peter's victory over Sweden in the Great Northern War in 1721. The fountains were fed by reservoirs in the upper garden, while the Samson fountain was fed by a specially-constructed aqueduct four kilometers in length.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 19th century fountains ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nIn the early 19th century, London and Paris built aqueducts and new fountains to supply clean drinking water to their exploding populations. Napoleon Bonaparte started construction on the first canals bringing drinking water to Paris, fifteen new fountains, the most famous being the Fontaine du Palmier in the Place du Ch\u00e2telet, (1896\u20131808), celebrating his military victories.\nHe also restored and put back into service some of the city's oldest fountains, such as the Medici Fountain. Two of Napoleon's fountains, the Chateau d'Eau and the fountain in the Place des Vosges, were the first purely decorative fountains in Paris, without water taps for drinking water.Louis-Philippe (1830\u20131848) continued Napoleon's work, and added some of Paris's most famous fountains, notably the Fontaines de la Concorde (1836\u20131840) and the fountains in the Place des Vosges.Following a deadly cholera epidemic in 1849, Louis Napoleon decided to completely rebuild the Paris water supply system, separating the water supply for fountains from the water supply for drinking. The most famous fountain built by Louis Napoleon was the Fontaine Saint-Michel, part of his grand reconstruction of Paris boulevards. Louis Napoleon relocated and rebuilt several earlier fountains, such as the Medici Fountain and the Fontaine de Leda, when their original sites were destroyed by his construction projects.In the mid-nineteenth century the first fountains were built in the United States, connected to the first aqueducts bringing drinking water from outside the city. The first fountain in Philadelphia, at Centre Square, opened in 1809, and featured a statue by sculptor William Rush. The first fountain in New York City, in City Hall Park, opened in 1842, and the first fountain in Boston was turned on in 1848. The first famous American decorative fountain was the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park in New York City, opened in 1873.The 19th century also saw the introduction of new materials in fountain construction; cast iron (the Fontaines de la Concorde); glass (the Crystal Fountain in London (1851)) and even aluminium (the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain in Piccadilly Circus, London, (1897)).The invention of steam pumps meant that water could be supplied directly to homes, and pumped upward from fountains. The new fountains in Trafalgar Square (1845) used steam pumps from an artesian well. By the end of the 19th century fountains in big cities were no longer used to supply drinking water, and were simply a form of art and urban decoration.Another fountain innovation of the 19th century was the illuminated fountain: The Bartholdi Fountain at the Philadelphia Exposition of 1876 was illuminated by gas lamps. In 1884 a fountain in Britain featured electric lights shining upward through the water. The Exposition Universelle (1889) which celebrated the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution featured a fountain illuminated by electric lights shining up though the columns of water. The fountains, located in a basin forty meters in diameter, were given color by plates of colored glass inserted over the lamps. The Fountain of Progress gave its show three times each evening, for twenty minutes, with a series of different colors.\n\n\n=== 20th century fountains ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nParis fountains in the 20th century no longer had to supply drinking water - they were purely decorative; and, since their water usually came from the river and not from the city aqueducts, their water was no longer drinkable. Twenty-eight new fountains were built in Paris between 1900 and 1940; nine new fountains between 1900 and 1910; four between 1920 and 1930; and fifteen between 1930 and 1940.The biggest fountains of the period were those built for the International Expositions of 1900, 1925 and 1937, and for the Colonial Exposition of 1931. Of those, only the fountains from the 1937 exposition at the Palais de Chaillot still exist. (See Fountains of International Expositions).\nOnly a handful of fountains were built in Paris between 1940 and 1980. The most important ones built during that period were on the edges of the city, on the west, just outside the city limits, at La D\u00e9fense, and to the east at the Bois de Vincennes.\nBetween 1981 and 1995, during the terms of President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Culture Minister Jack Lang, and of Mitterrand's bitter political rival, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac (Mayor from 1977 until 1995), the city experienced a program of monumental fountain building that exceeded that of Napoleon Bonaparte or Louis Philippe. More than one hundred fountains were built in Paris in the 1980s, mostly in the neighborhoods outside the center of Paris, where there had been few fountains before These included the Fontaine Cristaux, homage to B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k by Jean-Yves Lechevallier (1980);  the Stravinsky Fountain next to the Pompidou Center, by sculptors Niki de Saint Phalle and Jean Tinguely (1983); the fountain of the Pyramid of the Louvre by I.M. Pei, (1989), the Buren Fountain by sculptor Daniel Buren,  Les Sph\u00e9rades fountain, both in the Palais-Royal, and the fountains of Parc Andr\u00e9-Citro\u00ebn. The Mitterrand-Chirac fountains had no single style or theme. Many of the fountains were designed by famous sculptors or architects, such as Jean Tinguely, I.M. Pei, Claes Oldenburg and Daniel Buren, who had radically different ideas of what a fountain should be. Some were solemn, and others were whimsical. Most made little effort to blend with their surroundings - they were designed to attract attention.\nFew new fountains have been built in Paris since 2000. The most notable is La Danse de la fontaine emergente (2008), located on Place Augusta-Holmes, rue Paul Klee, in the 13th arrondissement. It was designed by the French-Chinese sculptor Chen Zhen (1955\u20132000), shortly before his death in 2000, and finished through the efforts of his spouse and collaborator. It shows a dragon, in stainless steel, glass and plastic, emerging and submerging from the pavement of the square. Water under pressure flows through the transparent skin of the dragon.\nFountains built in the United States between 1900 and 1950 mostly followed European models and classical styles.\nThe Samuel Francis Dupont Memorial Fountain, in Dupont Circle, Washington D.C., was designed and created by Henry Bacon and Daniel Chester French, the architect and sculptor of the Lincoln Memorial, in 1921, in a pure neoclassical style.\nThe Buckingham Fountain in Grant Park in Chicago was one of the first American fountains to use powerful modern pumps to shoot water as high as 150 feet (46 meters) into the air.\nThe Fountain of Prometheus, built at the Rockefeller Center in New York City in 1933, was the first American fountain in the Art-Deco style.\nAfter World War II, fountains in the United States became more varied in form. Some, like the Vaillancourt Fountain in San Francisco (1971), were pure works of sculpture. Other fountains, like the Frankin Roosevelt Memorial Waterfall (1997), by architect Lawrence Halprin, were designed as landscapes to illustrate themes. This fountain is part of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington D.C., which has four outdoor \"rooms\" illustrating his Presidency. Each \"room\" contains a cascade or waterfall; the cascade in the third room illustrates the turbulence of the years of the World War II. Halprin wrote at an early stage of the design; \"the whole environment of the memorial becomes sculpture: to touch, feel, hear and contact - with all the senses.\"The end of the 20th century the development of high-shooting fountains, beginning with the Jet d'eau in Geneva in 1951, and followed by taller and taller fountains in the United States and the Middle East. The highest fountain today in the King Fahd's Fountain in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\nIt also saw the increasing popularity of the musical fountain, which combined water, music and light, choreographed by computers.  (See Musical fountain below).\n\n\n=== Contemporary fountains (2001\u20132011) ===\n\nThe fountain called Bit. Fall by German artist Julius Popp (2005) uses digital technologies to spell out words with water. The fountain is run by a statistical program which selects words at random from news stories on the Internet. It then recodes these words into pictures. Then 320 nozzles inject the water into electromagnetic valves. The program uses rasterization and bitmap technologies to synchronize the valves so drops of water form an image of the words as they fall. According to Popp, the sheet of water is \"a metaphor for the constant flow of information from which we cannot escape.\"Crown Fountain is an interactive fountain and video sculpture feature in Chicago's Millennium Park. Designed by Catalan artist Jaume Plensa, it opened in July 2004. The fountain is composed of a black granite reflecting pool placed between a pair of glass brick towers. The towers are 50 feet (15 m) tall, and they use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to display digital videos on their inward faces. Construction and design of the Crown Fountain cost US$17 million.  Weather permitting, the water operates from May to October, intermittently cascading down the two towers and spouting through a nozzle on each tower's front face.\nLa Danse de la fontaine emergente, Place Augusta-Holmes, Paris (13th arrondissement) (2008), is the newest fountain in Paris. The fountain is designed to resemble a dragon winding its way around the square, emerging and submerging from the pavement. The skin of the dragon is transparent, showing the water flowing within. The water flowing within the dragon is under pressure and is illuminated at night. It is constructed of stainless steel, glass, and plastic. It was designed by the French-Chinese sculptor Chen Zhen (1955\u20132000)\nThe fountain is in three parts. A bas-relief of the dragon is fixed on the wall of the structure of the water-supply plant, and the dragon seems to be emerging from the wall and plunging underground. This part of the dragon is opaque. The second and third parts depict the arch of the dragon's back coming out of the pavement. These parts of the dragon are transparent, and water under pressure flows within, and is illuminated at night.\n\n\n== Musical fountains ==\nMusical fountains create a theatrical spectacle with music, light and water, usually employing a variety of programmable spouts and water jets controlled by a computer.\nMusical fountains were first described in the 1st century AD by the Greek scientist and engineer Hero of Alexandria in his book Pneumatics. Hero described and provided drawings of \"A bird made to whistle by flowing water,\" \"A Trumpet sounded by flowing water,\" and \"Birds made to sing and be silent alternately by flowing water.\"  In Hero's descriptions, water pushed air through musical instruments to make sounds. It is not known if Hero made working models of any of his designs.During the Italian Renaissance, the most famous musical fountains were located in the gardens of the Villa d'Este, in Tivoli. which were created between 1550 and 1572. Following the ideas of Hero of Alexandria, the Fountain of the Owl used a series of bronze pipes like flutes to make the sound of birds. The most famous feature of the garden was the great Organ Fountain. It was described by the French philosopher Michel de Montaigne, who visited the garden in 1580: \"The music of the Organ Fountain is true music, naturally created ... made by water which falls with great violence into a cave, rounded and vaulted, and agitates the air, which is forced to exit through the pipes of an organ. Other water, passing through a wheel, strikes in a certain order the keyboard of the organ. The organ also imitates the sound of trumpets, the sound of cannon, and the sound of muskets, made by the sudden fall of water ... The Organ Fountain fell into ruins, but it was recently restored and plays music again.\nLouis XIV created the idea of the modern musical fountain by staging spectacles in the Gardens of Versailles, using music and fireworks to accompany the flow of the fountains.\nThe great international expositions held in Philadelphia, London and Paris featured the ancestors of the modern musical fountain. They introduced the first fountains illuminated by gas lights (Philadelphia in 1876); and the first fountains illuminated by electric lights (London in 1884 and Paris in 1889). The Exposition Universelle (1900) in Paris featured fountains illuminated by colored lights controlled by a keyboard.  The Paris Colonial Exposition of 1931 presented the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'eau, or water theater, located in a lake, with performance of dancing water. The Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937) had combined arches and columns of water from fountains in the Seine with light, and with music from loudspeakers on eleven rafts anchored in the river, playing the music of the leading composers of the time. (See International Exposition Fountains, above.)\nToday some of the best-known musical fountains in the world are at the Bellagio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, (2009); the Dubai Fountain in the United Arab Emirates; the World of Color at Disney California Adventure Park (2010) and Aquanura at the Efteling in the Netherlands (2012).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Splash fountains ==\n\nA splash fountain or bathing fountain is intended for people to come in and cool off on hot summer days. These fountains are also referred to as interactive fountains. These fountains are designed to allow easy access, and feature nonslip surfaces, and have no standing water, to eliminate possible drowning hazards, so that no lifeguards or supervision is required. These splash pads are often located in public pools, public parks, or public playgrounds (known as \"spraygrounds\"). In some splash fountains, such as Dundas Square in Toronto, Canada, the water is heated by solar energy captured by the special dark-colored granite slabs. The fountain at Dundas Square features 600 ground nozzles arranged in groups of 30 (3 rows of 10 nozzles). Each group of 30 nozzles is located beneath a stainless steel grille. Twenty such grilles are arranged in two rows of 10, in the middle of the main walkway through Dundas Square.\n\n\n== Drinking fountain ==\n\nA water fountain or drinking fountain is designed to provide drinking water and has a basin arrangement with either continuously running water or a tap. The drinker bends down to the stream of water and swallows water directly from the stream. Modern indoor drinking fountains may incorporate filters to remove impurities from the water and chillers to reduce its temperature. In some regional dialects, water fountains are called bubblers. Water fountains are usually found in public places, like schools, rest areas, libraries, and grocery stores. Many jurisdictions require water fountains to be wheelchair accessible (by sticking out horizontally from the wall), and to include an additional unit of a lower height for children and short adults. The design that this replaced often had one spout atop a refrigeration unit.\nIn 1859, The Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association was established to promote the provision of drinking water for people and animals in the United Kingdom and overseas. More recently, in 2010, the FindaFountain campaign was launched in the UK to encourage people to use drinking fountains instead of environmentally damaging bottled water. A map showing the location of UK drinking water fountains is published on the FindaFountain website.\n\n\n== How fountains work ==\n \n\nFrom Roman times until the end of the 19th century, fountains operated by gravity, requiring a source of water higher than the fountain itself to make the water flow. The greater the difference between the elevation of the source of water and the fountain, the higher the water would go upwards from the fountain.\nIn Roman cities, water for fountains came from lakes and rivers and springs in the hills, brought into city in aqueducts and then distributed to fountains through a system of lead pipes.\nFrom the Middle Ages onwards, fountains in villages or towns were connected to springs, or to channels which brought water from lakes or rivers. In Provence, a typical village fountain consisted of a pipe or underground duct from a spring at a higher elevation than the fountain. The water from the spring flowed down to the fountain, then up a tube into a bulb-shaped stone vessel, like a large vase with a cover on top. The inside of the vase, called the bassin de r\u00e9partition, was filled with water up to a level just above the mouths of the canons, or spouts, which slanted downwards. The water poured down through the canons, creating a siphon, so that the fountain ran continually.\nIn cities and towns, residents filled vessels or jars of water jets from the canons of the fountain or paid a water porter to bring the water to their home. Horses and domestic animals could drink the water in the basin below the fountain. The water not used often flowed into a separate series of basins, a lavoir, used for washing and rinsing clothes. After being used for washing, the same water then ran through a channel to the town's kitchen garden. In Provence, since clothes were washed with ashes, the water that flowed into the garden contained potassium, and was valuable as fertilizer.The most famous fountains of the Renaissance, at the Villa d'Este in Tivoli, were located on a steep slope near a river; the builders ran a channel from the river to a large fountain at top of the garden, which then fed other fountains and basins on the levels below. The fountains of Rome, built from the Renaissance through the 18th century, took their water from rebuilt Roman aqueducts which brought water from lakes and rivers at a higher elevation than the fountains. Those fountains with a high source of water, such as the Triton Fountain, could shoot water 16 feet (4.9 m) in air. Fountains with a lower source, such as the Trevi Fountain, could only have water pour downwards. The architect of the Trevi Fountain placed it below street level to make the flow of water seem more dramatic.\nThe fountains of Versailles depended upon water from reservoirs just above the fountains. As King Louis XIV built more fountains, he was forced to construct an enormous complex of pumps, called the Machine de Marly, with fourteen water wheels and 220 pumps, to raise water 162 meters above the Seine River to the reservoirs to keep his fountains flowing. Even with the Machine de Marly, the fountains used so much water that they could not be all turned on at the same time. Fontainiers watched the progress of the King when he toured the gardens and turned on each fountain just before he arrived.The architects of the fountains at Versailles designed specially-shaped nozzles, or tuyaux, to form the water into different shapes, such as fans, bouquets, and umbrellas.\nIn Germany, some courts and palace gardens were situated in flat areas, thus fountains depending on pumped pressurized water were developed at a fairly early point in history. The Great Fountain in Herrenhausen Gardens at Hanover was based on ideas of Gottfried Leibniz conceived in 1694 and was inaugurated in 1719 during the visit of George I. After some improvements, it reached a height of some 35 m in 1721 which made it the highest fountain in European courts. The fountains at the Nymphenburg Palace initially were fed by water pumped to water towers, but as from 1803 were operated by the water powered Nymphenburg Pumping Stations which are still working.\nBeginning in the 19th century, fountains ceased to be used for drinking water and became purely ornamental. By the beginning of the 20th century, cities began using steam pumps and later electric pumps to send water to the city fountains. Later in the 20th century, urban fountains began to recycle their water through a closed recirculating system. An electric pump, often placed under the water, pushes the water through the pipes. The water must be regularly topped up to offset water lost to evaporation, and allowance must be made to handle overflow after heavy rain.\nIn modern fountains a water filter, typically a media filter, removes particles from the water\u2014this filter requires its own pump to force water through it and plumbing to remove the water from the pool to the filter and then back to the pool. The water may need chlorination or anti-algal treatment, or may use biological methods to filter and clean water.\nThe pumps, filter, electrical switch box and plumbing controls are often housed in a \"plant room\".\nLow-voltage lighting, typically 12 volt direct current, is used to minimise electrical hazards. Lighting is often submerged and must be suitably designed. High wattage lighting (incandescent and halogen) either as submerged lighting or accent lighting on waterwall fountains have been implicated in every documented Legionnaires' disease outbreak associated with fountains. This is detailed in the \"Guidelines for Control of Legionella in Ornamental Features\".\nFloating fountains are also popular for ponds and lakes; they consist of a float pump nozzle and water chamber.\n\n\n== The tallest fountains in the World ==\n\nKing Fahd's Fountain (1985) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The fountain jets water 312 meters (1,024 feet) above the Red Sea and is currently the tallest continually-running fountain in the world.\nThe World Cup Fountain in the Han-gang River in Seoul, Korea (2002), advertises a height of 202 meters (663 feet).\nThe Gateway Geyser (1995), next to the Mississippi River in St. Louis, Missouri, shoots water 192 meters (630 feet) in the air. It is the tallest fountain in the United States.\nPort Fountain (2006) in Karachi, Pakistan, rises to height of 190 meters (620 feet) making it the fourth tallest fountain.\nFountain Park, Fountain Hills, Arizona (1970). Can reach 171 meters (561 feet) when all three pumps are operating, but normally runs at 91 meters (300 feet).\nThe Dubai Fountain, opened in 2009 next to Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. The fountain performs once every half hour to recorded music, and shoots water to height of 73 meters (240 feet). The fountain also has extreme shooters, not used in every show, which can reach 150 meters (490 feet).\nThe Captain James Cook Memorial Jet in Canberra (1970), 147 meters (482 feet)\nThe Jet d'eau, in Geneva (1951), 140 meters (460 feet)\n\n\n== Gallery of notable fountains around the world ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nWishing well, for the practice of dropping coins into fountains\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHelen Attlee, Italian Gardens \u2013 A Cultural History.
